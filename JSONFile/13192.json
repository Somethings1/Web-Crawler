Since then, some floor prices have gone up, some floor prices have gone down,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PacmanBlur\/status\/1676662995970150401?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pacman tweeted<\/a> late on July 5. \u201COne of the few times floor prices went up in concert was when we injected liquidity into nfts via our airdrop.&nbsp;One of the few times floor prices went down in concert was when $40m of liquidity was removed via the Azuki mint (not throwing stones, the market just moves based on liquidity more than anything else).\u201D","The NFT market has been in a supressed state for over a year, at least relative to the dizzying heights of 2021. Lately, even the premier collections have suffered. &nbsp;","The floor price \u2014 the cheapest point of entry for an NFT collection \u2014 of Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club currently sits at 28 ETH (around $53,000), as low as it\u2019s been in over 18 months and less than half its value at the start of the year, <a href=\"https:\/\/nftpricefloor.com\/bored-ape-yacht-club\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to NFT Price Floor data<\/a>.

It currently accounts for 70% of NFT marketplace volume on Ethereum, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/share-of-nft-marketplace-volume\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to The Block Research\u2019s data<\/a>.
