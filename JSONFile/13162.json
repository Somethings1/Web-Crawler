Crypto company employees should be mandated to file their potential conflicts of interest disclosures quarterly \u2014 just as it is mandatory at TradFi institutions. To prevent the risk of insider trading and commingling assets, there should be a \u201CChinese wall\u201D, strict separations of different departments within crypto organizations.
