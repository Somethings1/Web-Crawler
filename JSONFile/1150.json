The foundation\u2019s provisions unit will publish its official outline of the STRK allocation today and allow users to check if they qualify for distribution.","Starknet is an Ethereum Layer-2 network that leverages a ZK-Rollup solution for scaling decentralized applications. The token will help decentralize and govern the network, according to a statememt.","\u201CThe STRK Token was born so that STARK-based scaling can happen in a more decentralized way. The token design helps Starknet to be run and managed by the community, and Provisions is a powerful means to achieve this,\u201D said Diego Oliva, CEO of Starknet Foundation.","On February 20, the distribution will allow some 1.297 million wallets to claim the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270922\/starknet-approves-vote-to-add-ability-to-use-strk-token-for-paying-transaction-fees\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">STRK token<\/a>.

Additionally, 137,000 open-source developers and 19,000 ETH stakers also made the cut, according to eligibility data shared with The Block.","The criteria for user eligibility for the distribution were based on a November snapshot that looked at the amount of transactions and how often users interacted with the network. The criteria included $100 in cumulative value transacted, over five transactions, and activity in separate time intervals, although these are separate conditions.","Provisions that oversaw the token distribution plan is one of the many community initiatives by Starknet contributors.
