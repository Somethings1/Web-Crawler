The firm\u2019s co-founder and CEO Daumantas Dvilinskas <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/48415\/remittance-firm-transfergo-plans-to-move-to-ripple-solution-that-uses-xrp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> by 2020, \u201Ceven a few minutes will be too slow\u201D and that\u2019s why the plan of adding ODL.","TransferGo<a href=\"https:\/\/www.finextra.com\/pressarticle\/75281\/transfergo-launches-real-time-remittance-transfers-with-ripple\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> initially partnered with Ripple<\/a> in Sept. 2018 to help Indian migrant workers send money home to their families via RippleNet \u201C in just a few minutes.\u201D Now, the firm has expanded this partnership to allow any sender in Europe to transfer funds to a recipient bank account in India.","\u201CRipple gives us a competitive edge in India, which is the largest global cross-border remittance market, and today we\u2019re moving more than a couple of million pounds per year,\u201D said Dvilinskas.","He explained that before using RippleNet, TransferGo had to link up directly with its bank partners, but each one had a different technology stack. \u201CEvery integration was bespoke, which took up a lot of tech resources and was time-consuming. With RippleNet we saw a scalable opportunity to have one integration for multiple partners, so we don\u2019t have to redo it each time.\u201D","This has helped TransferGo reduce integration costs and pass it on to customers. \u201CWe\u2019re helping people save up to 90% on traditional fees for cross-border transfers,\u201D said Dvilinskas.","Looking ahead, TransferGo also plans to expand into new markets in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa in 2020 to provide services via RippleNet. Founded in 2012, TransferGo currently supports 22 currencies across 47 countries and is licensed and regulated by the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, according to its<a href=\"https:\/\/www.transfergo.com\/en\/send-money-to-india\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> website<\/a>.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nRipple's overall count of customers has crossed the 300-mark, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/46219\/ripple-says-more-than-two-dozen-customers-use-its-payments-solution-that-leverages-xrp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> earlier this month, adding that \u201Cmore than two dozen\u201D customers use its ODL solution to settle cross border payments. Money transfer firms MoneyGram, Viamericas and FlashFX, online workforce platform that connects employers with freelancers goLance, and financial services provider Interbank Peru, are some of its customers that currently use ODL.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["XRP"]}
