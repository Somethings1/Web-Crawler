In some cases, industry providers may purposefully seek to decentralize a virtual asset service in an attempt to avoid triggering AML\/CFT obligations, without recognizing that the obligations still apply so long as the provider continues to offer covered services.\"","At the same time, the authors acknowledge that illicit finance via DeFi and crypto remains small in comparison to activities conducted with government-issued or fiat currency.","As the report notes: \"Still, as previously noted in the 2022 NRAs, this risk assessment recognizes that most money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing by volume and value of transactions occurs in fiat currency or otherwise outside the virtual asset ecosystem via more traditional methods.\"","While the Treasury acknowledges the development of industry services like blockchain analytics, the report's authors argue that they \"do not sufficiently address the identified vulnerabilities on their own.\"","\"[T]he U.S. government should also seek to further promote the responsible innovation of compliance tools for the industry, an avenue many in the private sector are already pursuing,\" the authors note.&nbsp;","A Treasury official had previously teased the report's release last month, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/policy\/2023\/03\/14\/us-treasury-poised-to-release-view-on-how-defi-used-in-illicit-finance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinDesk<\/a> reported at the time.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with additional information.<\/em>","© 2023 The Block.
