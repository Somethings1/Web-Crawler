In the meantime, we\u2019ll continue to operate our business as usual,\u201D said Grewal.","Following his comments, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brian_armstrong\/status\/1666127353574219777\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a>, \"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Instead of publishing a clear rule book, the SEC has taken a regulation by enforcement approach that is harming America. So if we need to avail ourselves of the courts to get clarity, so be it.<\/span>\"","Armstrong noted that the lawsuit was heavily focused on the issue of whether the exchange was listing securities. On this point, he said the exchange was confident in its approach.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
