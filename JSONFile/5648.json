Already, the firm counts several large multi-billion dollar crypto-native and traditional funds among its clients, according to Johann Bornman, the initiative's product lead.&nbsp;","For bigger investment firms, interest in DeFi centers around exposure to higher yields from lending protocols like Aave or Compound.&nbsp;","\u201CSome of them are very active in terms of their yield fund strategies and their yield farming strategies,\u201D Bornman explained during a new episode of The Scoop podcast. \u201CBut on average, if you're talking about these larger hedge funds and pension funds that you mentioned and also some of the larger crypto funds, on average, you're seeing them sort of&nbsp; dip their toe into the space.\u201D","Bornman added:","\u201CAnd this might entail minting assets or lending assets on Compound and Aave or using some of the most well-known protocols in the space.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
