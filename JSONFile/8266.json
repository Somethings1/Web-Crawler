The transition to an \u201Coperating system\u201D is specifically aimed at addressing critical limitations in current rollup architectures on Ethereum, according to a statement.","With the mainnet launch later this year, Fuel will introduce a purpose-built virtual machine designed to improve performance for Ethereum rollups (developed using the platform) by enabling parallel transaction execution, allowing multiple transactions to be processed concurrently.&nbsp;","The project will also use state minimization techniques to combat state bloat \u2014 referring to the ever-increasing accumulation of data that must be entirely stored and managed by nodes in a blockchain to ensure proper chain validation and state transitions. These state minimization techniques will also aid in enhancing performance for rollups.","Such offerings, Fuel claims, will allow Fuel-powered rollups to scale \u2014 inheriting Ethereum-level security while maintaining the lowest node operation overheads.","\u201CAs rollups mature, it\u2019s clear that an operating environment optimized for their unique requirements is a non-negotiable next step. Fuel is that evolution: the \u2018Rollup OS\u2019 solves critical bottlenecks, future-proofing both rollup technology and the Ethereum ecosystem,\u201D said Nick Dodson, CEO and co-founder of Fuel Labs.","The Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem has been increasingly pivoting towards modularity, allowing rollups and other chains to utilize separate platforms for individual tasks such as data availability, consensus and execution.","Initially launched as a Layer 2 optimistic rollup on Ethereum in 2020, Fuel evolved into a more modular approach \u2014 acting as an execution layer for various blockchain configurations like rollups.","Fuel Network offers a modular execution layer (a blockchain focused on handling transactions), offering parallel transactions achieved through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/research\/fuelvm-an-alternative-to-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-156527\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FuelVM<\/a>, an alternative to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
