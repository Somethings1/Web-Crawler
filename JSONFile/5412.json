The company also said it has claims against Three Arrows Capital exceeding $650 million.","\"The debtors have determined, in their business judgment, that failure by the debtors to honor withdrawals any longer could materially harm customer morale during these Chapter 11 cases,\" the company's July 14 filing with the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York said. \"Reinstating access to withdrawals will alleviate customer concerns that access to their cash held in the [Metropolitan Commercial Bank] accounts, and the integrity of the platform, is restored.\"","In its court filing, Voyager also is seeking authorization to carry out other financial actions. These include liquidating crypto from customer accounts with negative balances, \"sweep cash\" held in third-party exchanges, conducting \"ordinary course reconciliation\" of the customer accounts, continuing cryptocurrency staking and \"granting related relief.\"","A hearing has been scheduled for August 4 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.&nbsp;","Voyager<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/155990\/crypto-broker-voyager-digital-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> filed<\/a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on July 5.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
