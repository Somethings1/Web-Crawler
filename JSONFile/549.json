Documents related the purchases by the IRS and DEA were published in April and May, respectively.&nbsp;","Notably, the IRS document draws a connection between Coinbase Analytics and Neutrino, an intelligence agency that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/14741\/coinbase-acquired-neutrino-for-13-5m-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase controversially purchased<\/a> in 2019. The acquisition drew controversy due to its founders' involvement in the Italian spyware firm Hacking Team, and Coinbase ultimately said that it would part ways with team members associated with Hacking Team.","As the IRS document explains:","Public records indicate that Coinbase has not been officially granted the awards, and the company does not appear in queries submitted to USASpending.gov, a directory for government contract awards. According to this <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.sam.gov\/entity\/081007539?keywords=Coinbase&amp;sort=-relevance&amp;index=&amp;is_active=true&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">database<\/a> page, Coinbase's registration to offer products and services to the U.S. government became active on April 28, with an expiration date of April 13, 2021.","When reached for comment, a Coinbase spokesperson told The Block that \"[t]he information offered in Coinbase Analytics has always been kept completely separate from Coinbase internal data,\" going on to say:","A request for comment sent to the Department of Justice was not returned by press time.&nbsp;","It is unclear how much Coinbase would be paid for the licenses. The DEA document includes a subheader explaining that it is \"Required for Limited Source Acquisitions Over $10,000 but not Exceeding $250,000,\" indicating that the amount paid would fall in that range.","The documents illustrate how the two agencies want to apply Coinbase's platform to their respective investigative toolkits. In the case of the IRS, the software would be utilized by the tax authority's Criminal Investigation Cyber Crimes Unit.","The DEA document states:","The DEA document further explains that \"[w]ithout this advanced tool DEA would not be unable to conduct on the spot verification of money movement\" and \"this is the least expensive tool on the market and has the most features for the money.\" On the latter statement, no price point is given.","A DEA Limited Source Document is dated February 11, 2020, and according to the contract directory, it was originally published on May 18. As noted: \"All communication regarding this posting shall be in writing and received on or before 10:00 a.m. (ET) May 22, 2020.\" The IRS document was posted on April 7.","Coinbase Analytics is not a publicly acknowledged offering.
