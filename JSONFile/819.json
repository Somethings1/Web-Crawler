Some proponents have also viewed bitcoin as a <a href=\"https:\/\/ftalphaville.ft.com\/2020\/03\/09\/1583742985000\/Isn-t-bitcoin-meant-to-be-a-safe-haven-\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">safe haven<\/a>, a place where investors can expect outsized returns during broader market turmoil. The past week's market performance and revelations about the coronavirus's spread have put both these viewpoints have been put to the test.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged Monday morning at the open, shedding more than 7% following the biggest one-day decline in oil prices in 30 years <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fintechfrank\/status\/1237011080498511878?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">over the weekend<\/a>.

Indeed, the correlation between bitcoin \u2013 which is often referred to as \"digital gold\" \u2013 and gold has flipped to -0.22.&nbsp;","Aside from price action, data from CME Group's bitcoin futures market indicates that institutional investors are shunning bitcoin. If bitcoin was a safe haven, one might expect volumes to increase while investors seek safety, as noted by The Block's Ryan Todd. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/uncorrelated-is-uncorrelated-data-continues-to-suggest-bitcoin-clearly-not-a-haven-asset-56928\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Here's Todd<\/a>:","But that hasn't happened, as the data indicates:","","","Daily volume for CME bitcoin futures peaked the day before U.S. equities made all-time highs (February 19) at over $1 billion in volume, before falling now close to 75%.
