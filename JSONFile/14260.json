More recently, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227253\/coinbase-bermuda-offshore-derivatives-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">secured a license<\/a> to operate an international exchange out of Bermuda, where it plans to offer derivatives trading.","This morning, Coinbase announced that it is introducing no-fee purchases of USDC for customers using SGD, allowing users to earn rewards for holding USDC on the platform and rolling out USDC order books for more experienced traders \u2014 allowing them to trade over 200 assets against USDC.","The company is also enabling staking for ETH, SOL, ADA, ATOM and XTZ for customers in Singapore.","This new functionality, Coinbase said in its announcement, comes in response to the findings of a survey that sampled 2,000 adults in Singapore.","The findings suggest that fully a quarter of Singaporeans consider crypto the future of finance, on par with the U.S. and surpassing the 17% recorded in an equivalent UK survey. It also found that 32% of Singaporeans own or used to own crypto, while more than half those people expect to trade or hold crypto this year.","\u201CAmid what might seem a somewhat sea of pessimistic headlines I think, for Singaporean consumers and users of crypto, we certainly see a lot of resilience come through,\u201D said Ahmed. \u201CThe adoption cycle continues to play out.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
