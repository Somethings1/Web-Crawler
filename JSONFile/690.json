He also anticipates a resurgence of NFTs as they gain new utility beyond collectibles. \u201CReal-world applications such as customer engagement strategies will demonstrate more clear use-cases like loyalty programs,\u201D he said.","Finally, Wu expects AI to make web3 more secure and vice versa. \u201CLarge Language Models are perfect for reviewing smart contracts and other vital code to ensure would-be exploits are stopped before they start. DeFi hacks and smart contracts exploits will become rare,\u201D he added.","According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/258805\/gnosis-chains-total-value-locked-doubles-to-150-million-after-makerdaos-spark-protocol-expansion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gnosis<\/a> co-founder Dr. Friederike Ernst, \u201C2024 will be the year that the web3 ecosystem either rises to the challenge of providing more user-friendly experiences or remains niche for yet another year.\u201D","\u201CIf Ethereum and other credibly neutral blockchains are going to become the global settlement layer, then the applications that run on it need to be made usable to a much wider audience,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s time we turn the very abundant research and proof of concept work that\u2019s been achieved over the last few years into actual UX improvements for live products.\u201D","Developments in account abstraction technology mean that seed phrases could become a historical practice for most in 2024, Ernst added. \u201CThe idea that the safety of assets meant having 12 words that you can never lose, but no one else can ever access, is outdated and to a large extent has been holding back progress for actual user adoption,\u201D he said.","Concordium co-founder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/254879\/concordium-founder-identity-verification-needed-to-prevent-crypto-scams\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lars Seier Christensen<\/a> was less optimistic about the prospect of spot bitcoin ETF approvals and the Bitcoin halving event leading to a new bull market in 2024.","\u201CIt is all a little bit too much \u2018textbook stuff\u2019 for my taste \u2014 halving, ETF approval and then a new bull market. Normally, in traditional financial markets, these types of scenarios aren\u2019t necessarily predictable because experienced participants are able to anticipate potential developments beyond the obvious,\u201D he said. \u201CBut maybe, due to the immaturity of crypto markets, it will play out as everyone predicts. I would be very careful, though. I think we will be in for some surprising deviations from the generally predicted path.\u201D","Christensen was more positive on blockchain-based stablecoin and real-world asset adoption in the year ahead. \u201CI think stablecoins right now are the most important use case for blockchain, eventually to be replaced or expanded by more general RWA tokenization,\u201D he said. \u201CIn their current stage, stablecoins make a lot of sense when it comes to transfers, settlement and finality. For these reasons, they will be embraced further in 2024, both in private solutions and new public sector experiments.\u201D","Christensen also argued reliable and trustworthy ID solutions on blockchain were becoming a necessity, especially given the rise of deepfakes and identity theft.","Sunny Lu, CEO at VeChain, also didn\u2019t think the bitcoin halving would have much of an impact, but that spot bitcoin ETF approvals and market regulations are much more significant for the year ahead.","\u201CThe attention of the entire crypto market is on ETF progress for bitcoin spot, which I believe may be the biggest milestone in bitcoin and crypto\u2019s history,\u201D Lu said. \u201CThe ETF will open the door for the world\u2019s biggest institutional investors to enter the crypto space.\u201D","Major regulatory progress stemming from examples like the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238100\/afme-defi-mica-exclusion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MiCA<\/a>) in Europe will also pave the way for the mass adoption of blockchain and crypto in the real world, according to Lu.","Anchorage Digital co-founder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/251503\/ether-staking-fourfold-anchorage-digital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Diogo Mónica<\/a> said that crypto was at the beginning of an institutional-led bull market heading into 2024, with institutions becoming the driving force behind a cycle for the first time.&nbsp;","Mónica expects to see a broader range of institutional players enter the crypto ecosystem in the year ahead \u2014 including asset managers, hedge funds and RIAs.","\u201CRising institutional participation means market structure reform will be front and center,\u201D Mónica said. \u201CApplying traditional market structure standards \u2014 like separating custody and exchange functions \u2014 to crypto was once just an ideal; now, it is a prerequisite for the future of the ecosystem.\u201D"],"hashtag":["AVALANCHE","BITCOIN","EUROZONE REGULATION","INVESTMENT FIRMS","KRAKEN","PAYMENTS","TOKENIZATION"]}
