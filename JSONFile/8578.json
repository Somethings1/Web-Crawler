The same day the decision came down, the firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/155000\/grayscale-files-suit-against-sec-following-rejection-of-gbtc-conversion-bid\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> it would appeal the decision, following through on earlier threats of legal action.&nbsp;","Today's brief contends that the SEC's refusal to approve GBTC's conversion harms its 850,000 investors who already own shares in the trust.&nbsp;","\"Given that the Commission did not approve the Trust to trade as an ETP on the Exchange, the value of its shares cannot closely track the value of the Trust\u2019s underlying bitcoin assets\u2014depriving Trust shareholders of billions of dollars in value,\" said the filing.","The argument is one that Salm previewed in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163903\/policy-scoop-grayscale-clo-on-taking-their-bitcoin-etf-rejection-to-the-courts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">previous interview<\/a>.&nbsp;","Many in the industry were hopeful the SEC would change its tune on spot bitcoin ETFs when it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/120758\/us-sec-said-allow-bitcoin-futures-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">green lit futures-based bitcoin ETFs<\/a> starting in October of last year. At the time, some thought it was a sign the SEC was taking a step closer to a physically-held product. However, hopes were quickly dashed as the SEC continued to reject applications for a spot bitcoin ETF, most recently with Tuesday's rejection of WisdomTree's proposal.","Grayscale planted the seeds of what would become its legal argument in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/125817\/grayscale-argues-the-secs-bitcoin-etf-treatment-could-violate-the-apa\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter<\/a> it sent to the SEC in November of last year, when the regulator began issuing a wave of new rejections.
