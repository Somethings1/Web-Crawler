With this surge in activity, the team was able to identify critical stress points in both the platform\u2019s design and infrastructure, which it is now actively addressing. Yet it found these issues difficult to solve while keeping the whole system working as intended.","During this testing phase, the network faced a significant spike in activity and a flood of data-intensive transactions. In response, developers increased the Base block gas limit \u2014 allowing for more transactions per block and aiming to mitigate the sharp rise in base fees.","However, following this modification, the team encountered challenges in securely delivering batches of cryptographic proofs of its network blocks back to Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, which serves as the Layer 1 (L1) chain in this context. A Layer 2 network runs on top of a Layer 1 network and batches transactions to it.","The team <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BuildOnBase\/status\/1666497557478924294\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a>, \u201CAfter the implementation of this [doubling gas limit] adjustment, we faced issues due to larger L2 blocks when trying to batch blocks back to the Goerli L1.\u201D After this, the team continued with fine tuning parameters regarding how it batches transactions.&nbsp;","\u201CWe fine-tuned parameters and made adjustments, hoping to reach equilibrium,\" Base said. \u201CDespite these changes, the system struggled to reach equilibrium and publish the unsafe blocks to the L1. It wasn\u2019t until the quests slowed down that we could close the gap \u2014 emphasizing the need for a more robust, long-term solution,\u201D the team acknowledged.","Built on Optimism\u2019s development software stack, known as the OP Stack, Base is designed to serve as a rollup network, similar to Optimism. It aims to execute off-chain computations on a secondary layer to facilitate faster, cheaper transactions \u2014 all while maintaining the security benefits of the Ethereum mainnet. Furthermore, this solution could potentially become the default Layer 2 network for Coinbase\u2019s on-chain products.","Base\u2019s core team has made two optimizations in an attempt to stabilize the system after seeing a major spike in activity. First, the core team said, it enhanced the data compression, aiming to better use the \"L1 transaction call data.\" Second, the team modified their system to allow the submission of multiple batches of transactions for each L1 block, rather than a single batch at a time. These changes, the team stated, could address the technical issues previously observed.","\u201CAs we look towards mainnet, these changes not only pave the way for possible increases in block gas limit but also ensure that base fees remain low and accessible for users,\" the team <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BuildOnBase\/status\/1666497565087391770\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>. \"They [changes] also increase the reliability of writing L2 data to the L1, crucial for maintaining speedy withdrawals and transactions.\u201D&nbsp;","The Base team previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231215\/uniswap-coinbase-layer-2-base\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> its testnet has drawn interest from a range of developers and projects, including Blackbird, Thirdweb, OAK, and Parallel.
