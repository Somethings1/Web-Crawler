In brief, rather than re-coding a project to fit a specific ledger at a later date, the projects can now be transferred from Aurora to most blockchains with no change in code. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The firm is hoping this will open companies up to the world of blockchain without forcing them to take the leap with one single provider. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset Yuval Rooz explained that some enterprises are conservative in their interest in blockchain because they are unready to risk committing to one ledger system over another when building infrastructure that will likely last at least a decade. Cloud compatibility mitigates this problem, according to Rooz.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COne of the things that we're doing with this strategy and with these announcements is we're actually allowing companies to not give up this wave of innovation by building it on traditional tech and not waiting another 10 years, but also not having to bet on which is the underlying protocol that is going to win in two to three years and allowing them to bridge [between traditional tech and blockchain],\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Digital Asset seems to be making DAML <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/vmwares-blockchain-platform-to-integrate-digital-assets-smart-contract-language\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as approachable as possible<\/a>, making the language compatible even with competitor ledgers like R3 Corda.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
