Given the app's popularity, JPMorgan strategists believe \"other payments companies to follow in facilitating client bitcoin investments or risk being left behind.\"","Indeed, payment giants <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/69201\/paypal-venmo-crypto-buy-sell-report\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">PayPal and Venmo are said to<\/a> be in the works to offer crypto buying and selling services to their millions of users.

They said the open interest in CME's bitcoin futures and BitMEX's bitcoin perpetual swap contracts \"increased sharply until mid-August before the September correction saw a retrenchment.\"","Bitcoin options have also seen a significant increase in open interest, said analysts, adding that it remains \"heavily skewed\" towards Deribit than CME Group. \"As we believe institutional clients would likely prefer to trade options contracts on a well-established and regulated exchange like CME, this suggests that Bitcoin options activity remains more retail-driven,\" said analysts.","Â© 2023 The Block.
