It warned the attacker that if the funds were not returned within 24 hours, it would launch a $1 million reward for information that would lead to their arrest and the return of all funds.","Euler lost the $197 million in a flash-loan attack. Flash loans allow DeFi users to borrow large amounts of funds against zero collateral, but the loans must be repaid before the transaction ends. The Euler attacker drained $136 million of staked ether (stETH), $34 million of USDC, $19 million of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and $8.7 million of DAI from the protocol.","Then they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/220463\/euler-finance-attacker-launders-tornado-cash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">transferred<\/a> 1,100 ETH ($1.8 million) to the cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash in an attempt to launder the stolen funds.","It remains to be seen whether the attacker returns the rest of the funds. \"They stopped at 3k ETH so could be trolling again,\" tweeted ZachXBT. \"They were [previously] trolling with that transaction to Lazarus.\"","On Friday, an address controlled by the Euler attacker sent 100 ETH (around $170,500) to a wallet associated with Lazarus Group's Ronin network hack, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lookonchain\/status\/1636586003174678528?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lookonchain<\/a>.
