Being an alternative store of value, its price is primarily a function of future demand that is driven by consensus of investors and the general public.\"","As regard to its investment in ETH, Meitu outlined to its shareholders various application activities including finance, games, social media and art and collectibles that have been built on top of the Ethereum protocol.","\"The Group is currently evaluating the feasibility of integrating blockchain technologies to its various overseas businesses, including but not limited to launching Ethereum-based dApps, as well as identifying suitable overseas blockchain-based projects for potential investments,\" Meitu said and hence \"purchasing Ether is therefore a logical preparation for both initiatives.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
