Adeyemo has urged Congress to take action to provide the government with \u201Cnecessary tools\u201D to combat illicit finance tied to cryptocurrencies.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Adeyemo said that terrorist groups have been trying to take advantage of cryptocurrencies over the past few years, according to his written <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.banking.senate.gov\/hearings\/an-update-from-the-treasury-department-countering-illicit-finance-terrorism-and-sanctions-evasion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">testimony<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> for the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Hearing scheduled for Tuesday.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CFor example, five years ago, al-Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups, largely based out of Syria, operated a bitcoin money laundering network using social media platforms to solicit cryptocurrency donations,\u201D he noted.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Adeyemo continued that one of the agency\u2019s bottlenecks lies in the fact that bad actors are \u201Cincreasingly finding ways to hide their identities and move resources using virtual currency.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With existing approaches to combating terrorist financing through the traditional financial system, the agency has effectively made it harder for terrorist groups to move money. However, \u201Cthe more effective our targeting has been, the more reason there is for these terrorist groups to look into virtual assets,\u201D Adeyemo said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He added that Russia is also increasingly turning to alternative payment mechanisms, including stablecoins, to \u201Ctry to circumvent our sanctions and continue to finance its war machine.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In December, a group of bipartisan U.S. senators <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266660\/bipartisan-group-of-senators-introduce-bill-to-expand-treasury-departments-sanctions-powers-and-provide-more-resources-to-address-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">introduced a bill<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that would broaden the Treasury\u2019s sanctions powers to cover more terrorist groups including Hamas, and give them more resources to address crypto.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Adeyemo noted that the Treasury sent proposals to the Committee in November in the hope of strengthening the government\u2019s counter-terrorist financing authorities.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He explained in the testimony that the proposals generally covered three reforms \u2014 the introduction of a secondary sanctions tool, modernizing and closing gaps in existing authorities, and addressing jurisdictional risk from offshore crypto platforms.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, the Treasury has the power to prohibit U.S. correspondent accounts and transaction processing for foreign financial institutions with suspicious activities. \u201CBut, unlike banks, foreign cryptocurrency exchanges and some money services businesses do not have or depend on correspondent accounts for all of their transactions,\u201D Adeyemo said, adding that a new secondary sanctions tool would help the Treasury to evolve its targeting capabilities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhile we continue to assess that terrorists prefer to use traditional financial products and services, we fear that without Congressional action to provide us with the necessary tools, the use of virtual assets by these actors will only grow,\u201D he continued.<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
