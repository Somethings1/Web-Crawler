In other words, the traditional model of banking familiar for over 800 years could be disrupted,\u201D he said.","The Bank of England \u2014 like many of the world\u2019s central banks \u2014 is currently exploring the possibility of launching a so-called \u201CBritcoin,\u201D a digital version of the pound sterling. It has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/103424\/bank-of-england-hiring-cbdc-team\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hiring CBDC experts<\/a> since late April.","But the Bank has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/107434\/uk-central-bank-digital-money-tread-carefully\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">repeatedly<\/a> stressed that a final decision on whether to proceed with the project remains some way off, and that both the risks and benefits of such a currency should be weighed carefully.","This is not the first time commercial banks have been put on notice. The momentum behind CBDCs globally has given rise to fears that the typical bank model of using short-term deposits to fund long-term investments \u2014 \u201Cmaturity transformation\u201D \u2014 could be put at risk.","The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia warned of exactly that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.centralbanking.com\/fintech\/cbdc\/7559416\/cbdc-could-endanger-maturity-transformation-philadelphia-fed-paper\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in a paper<\/a> published June 2020. The argument goes that central banks have a clear competitive advantage over commercial banks during times of stress, and so would hoover up deposits.","In November last year, the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Sir John Cunliffe warned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/84530\/boe-central-bank-digital-currencies-deputy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">that it is not its job<\/a> to \u201Cprotect bank business models.\u201D","But in his farewell speech, Haldane said that any such disruption to commercial banking may come with a silver lining.","\u201CSpecifically, this could lead to a closer alignment of risk for those institutions, new and old, offering these services \u2013 narrow banking for payments (money backed by safe assets) and limited purpose banking for lending (risky assets backed by risky liabilities),\u201D said Haldane. &nbsp;","\u201CThis radically different topology, while not costless, would reduce at source the fragilities in the banking model that have been causing financial crises for over 800 years. Given the costs of those crises \u2013 large and rising \u2013 this is a benefit that needs to be weighed,\u201D he added."],"hashtag":["CBDCS"]}
