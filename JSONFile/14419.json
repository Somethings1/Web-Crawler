The Voyager case targets CEO Steve Ehrlich, the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and the team\u2019s billionaire owner Mark Cuban. Voyager filed for bankruptcy protection in July.","The possible suit comes days after FTX's shocking collapse. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned his post when the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware on Friday. At its peak, the company was valued at $32 billion, but crumbled after a run on its native utility token FTT.","Boies is a well-known trial lawyer who has represented the infamous medical company Theranos, Jeffrey Epstein's victims and disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, among others.

He also helped argue the U.S. government's case against Microsoft in a landmark anti-trust trial.&nbsp;","Boies is co-lead counsel on the Voyager case with Adam Moskowitz, managing partner of The Moskowitz Law Firm. Moskowitz and a Boies spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.","It\u2019s not clear which FTX promoters the possible class action suit might target.
