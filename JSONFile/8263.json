The defendant argued that the search violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure and Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination due to the way the search was conducted.&nbsp;","The DOJ's case contends that Chastain turned a profit on NFTs he knew would be listed on OpenSea's homepage due to his position at the firm, essentially profiting on insider information. While the alleged activity is similar to the securities violation of insider trading, the DOJ levied wire fraud charges against him due to uncertainty over whether an NFT constitutes a security, though prosecutors maintain he committed acts similar to insider trading.&nbsp;","A third motion to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174566\/opensea-employee-accused-of-fraud-wants-to-subpoena-the-nft-marketplace\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">subpoena OpenSea<\/a> remains open. Chastain wants documents from his former employer that he says could show that executives were aware of the activity, and whether the information he allegedly used to turn a profit is considered \"property\" of OpenSea.&nbsp;","Furman's order said he would further explain the reasons for the denials at a Thursday conference. That conference will also set the schedule and length for a future trial.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
