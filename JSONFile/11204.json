Transactions on the chain will be paid for using bone, the governance token of the Shiba DAO. Bone tokens will also be used to reward validators and delegators in the Shibarium network, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.shibaswap.com\/introduction-to-shibarium\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announcement<\/a>. As such, 20 million bone tokens, currently worth $27 million, have been reserved to pay out these rewards.
