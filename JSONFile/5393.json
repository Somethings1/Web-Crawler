The data does not include further personal information \u2014 such as home addresses and emails.","During the court case, Celsius asked for the names of its users to be hidden from the court filings, but the judge repeatedly refused on the basis that this is a common requirement for bankruptcy cases.","The 18.6 gigabytes of user data also don\u2019t contain blockchain transaction records, such as hashes pertaining to specific transactions. However, it does contain the dates and transaction amounts \u2014 meaning these transactions can likely be identified. This could let anyone connect the named users with their previously anonymous cryptocurrency wallets, and see their crypto holdings and other transaction information.","What's potentially damaging about this information is the way it could identify high-value cryptocurrency owners. While home addresses were not revealed, this information can be found separately \u2014 and many crypto users have already had that data publicly leaked via the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/88706\/a-detailed-look-at-the-ledger-data-leak-and-other-recent-incidents\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ledger data breach<\/a>.","We have reached out to Celsius and will update this story should we hear back.","Â© 2023 The Block.
