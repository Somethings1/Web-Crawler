It makes sense to go after bad actors engaging in fraud, Peirce added.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"But when you're talking about registration violations, because someone has touched a crypto asset, that we then come in years later and say ah, that is a security,\" Peirce continued, \"It seems pointless because you're bringing a case against someone where there's no allegation that anyone was hurt.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">She added that she was not minimizing the importance of registration obligations.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"But if you're not willing to tell people what a security is, it seems very unproductive to go in after the fact and just start picking people off for not having registered,\" Peirce said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who presides over Peirce and three other commissioners, has taken the stance that many cryptocurrencies are securities and has called on crypto platforms to register with the regulator and abide by its securities laws. The crypto industry, meanwhile, has said clarity is needed on how the rules apply to them. Coinbase filed a rulemaking petition in 2022 to get new rules specific to the industry, but the SEC has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/267840\/sec-denies-coinbase-petition-for-new-crypto-rulemaking-gensler-says\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">brushed<\/span><\/a> it off and says existing rules apply.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lawmakers in Washington too have been working on legislation for years to regulate the industry, but have not yet come close to getting in front of President Joe Biden to sign.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Peirce was also asked Thursday about her safe harbor proposal, which she debuted back in 2020.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The safe harbor proposal <\/span><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"seeks to provide network developers with a three-year grace period within which, under certain conditions, they can facilitate participation in and the development of a functional or decentralized network, exempted from the registration provisions of the federal securities laws,\" Peirce <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/101553\/sec-peirce-token-safe-harbor-update\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/span><\/a> in 2021.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An updated version would require the projects to make semi-annual updates and an analysis explaining why the network is decentralized or functional.
