Riley.","Representatives of the company asked the court for interim approval for an initial draft of $35 million.","The company will use the funds to repay the original DIP loan it had initially presented when filing for bankruptcy in December, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/197047\/core-scientific-eyes-sale-of-up-to-1-gigawatt-worth-of-facilities-amid-bankruptcy-exclusive\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">with a prearranged deal<\/a> that involved turning most of its debt into equity. At that time, it took out an initial $37.5 million.","Since then, bitcoin's price has risen over 30%, and the company's cash flow has \"significantly\" improved, representatives of the company said during a meeting Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.","The new deal will give Core Scientific \"up to 15 months of runway and significant flexibility\" since it has no \"plan-related milestones and is not conditioned on seeking approval of any specific Chapter 11 plan,\" the motion said.","The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors issued a <a href=\"https:\/\/cases.stretto.com\/public\/X217\/12024\/PLEADINGS\/1202401312380000000103.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">support statement<\/a> for the deal, saying in a <a href=\"https:\/\/cases.stretto.com\/public\/X217\/12024\/PLEADINGS\/1202401312380000000103.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filing<\/a> Tuesday that while the original DIP loan \"represented a substantial threat to unsecured creditor recoveries,\" the new one gives Core \"flexibility to pursue a plan of reorganization that will maximize value for all creditors, rather than just the convertible noteholders.\"","However, it opposed the payment of a 15% termination fee (about $6 million), arguing that it was approved only on an interim basis and that \"the court is not bound by the original interim DIP order\u2019s approval of the original DIP\u2019s fees because it was not a final order.\"","A representative of the committee claimed that this amount was \"unreasonable\" and would \"deprive\" unsecured creditors of $4 million. Representatives of the debtor argued, on the contrary, that the termination fee was priced into the original DIP loan and should remain.","The objection on the termination fee was overruled by judge David R. Jones, who said \"the process has to be bigger than any particular case.\"","Some of Core Scientific's top creditors, like Barrings, had filed objections to the original DIP financing, arguing that they needed adequate protection. But the new deal has found support from the multiple parties involved in the bankruptcy.","\"In bankruptcy, there's an order of things.
