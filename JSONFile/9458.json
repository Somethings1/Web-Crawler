Now, it\u2019s working to launch its platform in Colombia and gain a seat at the table as regulators define the country\u2019s digital asset policy. The South American country ranked 11th on Chainalysis\u2019 2021 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/go.chainalysis.com\/2021-geography-of-crypto-demo.html?aliId=eyJpIjoiQlIrazhQK2RFZm5KVVFOcyIsInQiOiJoRENhZ3Z0Z0ZFRm55aDd6Y0M2SXNRPT0ifQ%253D%253D\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">global crypto adoption index<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pardo, who joined Bitso after serving as Mastercard\u2019s head of business development for the Andes region, says he was drawn to working with the cryptocurrency exchange because of its approach with financial regulators.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CRegulation in Colombia, I think, sooner or later it\u2019s going to come,\u201D Pardo said. \u201CAnd we are the first one raising our hand saying, \u2018We want to be regulated. We want to have the rules of the game clear.\u2019\u201D Moreover, Bitso also wants to play a role in helping regulators navigate the crypto ecosystem.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But despite the strong interest in crypto usage here, Colombia has not yet formed any specific regulations around using digital assets. However, its tax authority recently announced it would<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dian.gov.co\/Prensa\/Paginas\/Comunicado-de-Prensa-009.aspx\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> take action<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to crack down on those who do not correctly declare crypto assets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One of the most important factors shaping Colombia\u2019s future crypto policy is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.superfinanciera.gov.co\/inicio\/innovasfc\/laarenera-10099575\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sandbox supervised by Colombia\u2019s financial regulator<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (SFC). The project is allowing crypto firms like Bitso to demonstrate what types of services it can offer to banks and financial institutions.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Under this sandbox, Bitso has been working on a pilot program with the country\u2019s oldest bank, Banco de Bogotá. The partnership, which went live for certain customers and employees last month, focuses on offering cash-in and cash-out operations. It is scheduled to run until January 2023. Up to 5,000 customers can take part in the project, Pardo said, with the bank ultimately responsible for choosing how many people will be able to participate.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Since Bitso is taking the approach of working with Colombian regulators before officially launching a product in the market, its trading platform is not widely available here yet. However, Pardo said the company has a goal of making its services available to all Colombians before the end of the year. It plans to hire more people in Colombia to fill out its small team of about 10-15 people, placing priority on roles relating to compliance and public policy.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitso isn\u2019t the only exchange courting Colombia\u2019s financial institutions and regulators as crypto finds its footing in the country.
