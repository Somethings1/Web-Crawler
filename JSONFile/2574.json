Then, fake volume is introduced to bait traders. If enough legitimate capital is drawn in, the scammers (assuming there are more than one) cash out the token, repeating the process over and over.&nbsp;","While the token\u2019s contract seemingly passes several security measures, in reality the scam operators retain the ability to burn tokens holders at will, mint infinite tokens for the scammers (despite the tokens seemingly being locked), and fake the max supply of the token.","\u201DIt could be just one person organizing all of this because, as we have seen, many of the things seem to be done programmatically, like the creation of the token names seems to be lots of words mixed with AI. The deployment of the tokens\u2026the creation of the liquidity pools, the locking of the LP tokens, the rug pull; most of them seem to be automatic,\u201D said Pablo Sabbatella, one of the authors of the <a href=\"https:\/\/blockfence.io\/security\/32m-stolen-over-1300-fake-tokens-rugged\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">investigation<\/a>.","Sabbatella began looking into the scam after the scam operation launched a token named after his company, Blockfence, which was one of hundreds of scam coins created. However, the scammers seemingly limit their profit per token to 5-20 eth, helping them stay under the radar, according to Sabbatella.&nbsp;","\u201CNow we are going to go a bit deeper in this operation and we are going to see what they\u2019re doing on Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, and Base,\u201D said Sabbatella.&nbsp;","How can crypto traders protect themselves for similar scams? Not trading sketchy tokens is the first step, says Sabbatella. \u201CYou already know you are exposing yourself to a high, high risk,\u201D said Sabbatella. \u201CI would never buy or invest in an asset I don\u2019t understand.\u201D","For traders willing to take the risk, though, Sabbatella advises using a variety of fraud detectors. \u201CI recommend not just using one tool, but using two or three different tools and to get the results from all of them,\u201D he said.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["EXPLOITS"]}
