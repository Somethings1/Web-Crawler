At the time, Seifert said how they would be helpful for the industry and for the UK as a crypto hub.&nbsp;","Now the UK's markets regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has said they can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fca.org.uk\/news\/statements\/fca-updates-position-cryptoasset-exchange-traded-notes-professional-investors\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">go ahead<\/a>, but only for institutional investors.","\u201CWe think it's a validation for the United Kingdom, and for its strategy. And I think the future is bright,\u201D Seifert told The Block in an interview.","As for the launch of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., Seifert was even more enthusiastic.","&nbsp;\u201CThe fact that ETFs were launched in the United States and that that generated so much momentum and so much buzz globally, I think it's a monumental milestone for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole,\u201D he said.","Seifert noted that the bitcoin ETFs have resulted in an injection of institutional capital as there is a new way for traditional investors to get into the crypto ecosystem. He said he anticipates this continuing as more products may be on the way and since asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity are now speaking to their customer base about the bitcoin ETFs.","When asked whether he would want to see bitcoin ETFs available in the UK, Seifert replied, \u201CI would say more choice for consumers is always good.\u201D","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
