It also got NFT fans thinking.&nbsp;","\u201CIt took them a month or two [for the seller to] provide a picture,\u201D Scott Emer, co-founder of Trading Card World, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/tabletop-games\/23687028\/stolen-pokemon-card-rumors-true-story-fusion-strike\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told<\/a> Polygon in an interview. \u201CWhen they finally did, we were like, <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Well, this looks really weird<\/em>.\u201D","In a statement <a href=\"https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/groups\/239026353914564\/permalink\/975227613627764\/?mibextid=Nif5oz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued<\/a> on Facebook, TCW said it contacted The Pokemon Company \u2014 which allegedly already knew the cards were missing \u2014 and worked together to retrieve and return them. A spokesperson for The Pokemon Company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the alleged theft.&nbsp;","Either way, fans of the Pokemon trading card game weren't happy, with some now seeking a blockchain-based solution so this can't happen again.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A desk stacked with apparently stolen Pokemon cards. Source: Reddit.<\/span>","Pokemon trading cards are distributed in blind packs \u2014 meaning buyers do not know what is inside. Even the manufacturer is kept in the dark.","Still, each pack is guaranteed to have one rare card. And some rares, such as those printed with a rainbow holographic theme or alternative art, are significantly rarer (and more valuable) than others.","It's this blind nature of Pokemon card packs that feeds into the popularity of pack-opening videos on YouTube and other video streaming services. People love to watch and see if others get a hit card (or don't).","Pokemon cards also aren't cheap \u2014 especially in some countries outside of the United States. For example, one booster box containing 36 packs of Pokemon cards (360 single cards in total) costs 63,000 Hungarian forint ($185) in the central European country at retail. (Buyers in the U.S. can scoop the same boxes for roughly $120 on eBay).","For these reasons, some fans of the Pokemon Trading Card Game have <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adamamcbride\/status\/1648385192363433992\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">vented<\/a> their frustrations online over the apparent off-the-production-line theft of prized cards.&nbsp;Making matters worse is a long-standing complaint that pull rates for the most-prized cards feel very low \u2014 particularly for the set in question, Fusion Strike.","\"The rarest card in Chilling Reign was a Alternate Art Vmax Blaziken,\" one blog <a href=\"https:\/\/pokepatch.com\/2021\/11\/14\/fusion-strike-pull-rates-might-be-the-worst-weve-seen\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">explained<\/a>, claiming: \"The pull rate on this Blaziken is about 1\/450. The pull rate on the Alternate Art Vmax Mew in Fusion Strike is about 1\/2,100. That means the rarest card in Fusion Strike is 4x harder to pull than the rarest card in Chilling Reign.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An ungraded Gengar VMAX #271 currently costs around the same as an entire Fusion Strike booster box.
