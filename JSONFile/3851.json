I can't imagine his voice will carry any weight going forward,'' Yoon said.&nbsp;","Some in Washington were blunter. \"Unless it's him testifying at an oversight committee, it's over,\" said Alex Allaire, chief executive officer of the American Blockchain Initiative.","Experts see the whole affair as focusing a negative spotlight on the industry.","\u201CFor many years now there\u2019s been renewed calls for stronger regulation of crypto finance overall,\u201D said Fabian Astic, global head of DeFi and digital assets at the investment research service Moody\u2019s. \u201CCertainly this episode will probably add to that pressure.\u201D","Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, became a public face for crypto within just a year of emerging on the scene around 2018. Touted as a genius with a knack for spotting lucrative trading strategies in crypto's volatile and inefficient markets, he quickly won over decision-makers and pundits alike with a wide-eyed vision for digital assets, a giant mop of hair and disheveled clothing.&nbsp;","It didn't hurt that Bankman-Fried also was generous with his largesse: sponsoring conferences, touting his philanthropic ambitions, and handing over tens of millions of dollars to Washington lawmakers.","Bankman-Fried was a prolific political donor during the 2022 midterm election cycle. The FTX boss gave $27 million to his Protect Our Future super PAC, which said it backed candidates who were focused on preventing the next pandemic. Protect Our Future spent its millions in Democratic primaries this year, irking progressives. Super PACs can raise and spend unlimited funds, but cannot coordinate with campaigns.","Bankman-Fried also gave thousands in political donations to members of Congress, including Sens. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and John Boozman, R-Ark., the authors of Bankman-Fried's priority crypto regulation bill. His giving stretched beyond individual candidates, too. Bankman-Fried gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to major political groups, including the Democratic National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and state Democratic parties across the country.","Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., became the first member of Congress to renounce donations from the crypto mogul. A spokesperson told The Block that Garcia plans to give the $2,900 campaign contribution he received from Bankman-Fried to charity. Several political action committees did not respond to similar inquiries over whether they would return donations from Bankman-Fried.","\u201CA lot of Democrats who had considered that Sam Bankman-Fried was one of the good ones who we could really talk to, have a lot of egg on their faces,\u201D said Rohan Grey, a legal professor at Willamette University who provides advice to left-leaning House Democrats. &nbsp;","Ron Hammond, government relations director for the Blockchain Association, a major industry group, tweeted, \u201CNo CEO (crypto or not) has been personally lobbying in D.C. to this extent. This access to policymakers and staff was welcomed. Between his personality and apparent success, the Hill largely liked SBF.\u201D","Bankman-Fried\u2019s remarkable fall from grace seems a tale fit for the crypto age where fortunes have been made and lost trading digital assets named after pet dogs and fantasy unicorns.","The allegations of mishandling client assets and billions of dollars lost now cast a pall over crypto policy negotiations currently winding their way through Congress. The development has given succor to opponents who want the bills rewritten or scrapped.","The FTX CEO strongly pushed for the&nbsp;Digital Commodity Consumer Protection Act, a bill that would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more regulatory powers over the sector. The bill had divided the crypto community amid complaints the proposed rules were too stringent and would mainly benefit incumbents such as FTX. Several industry associations opposed the bill over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/182827\/defi-advocates-push-back-against-ftx-backed-crypto-bill\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fears that decentralized finance projects would be negatively impacted<\/a>.","\u201CDCCPA is still not finished yet and likely will be iced out til next year. However, Congress always feels compelled to act during a crisis,\u201D tweeted Hammond. \u201CThat doesn't mean crypto will be an afterthought til 2023. In fact, it is very likely that hearings will be held this month or next on this. Every Member will ask 'what happened and how can we prevent this from occurring again.'\"","The trail of destruction left by FTX\u2019s implosion \u2014 and the possible contagion caused by it \u2014 risks further tainting crypto's reputation among policymakers and the investing public alike. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Circle founder Jeremy Allaire <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jerallaire\/status\/1590589581220777986\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">were<\/a> among industry figures calling on lawmakers to focus on clearer regulations rather than any effort to clamp down. But it remains unclear to what extent Congress will become crypto-skeptical.","\u201CClearly the credibility of the FTX people is now shot,\u201D said Jim Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. \u201CThe nice thing about politicians is that they generally have no memory.\"","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
