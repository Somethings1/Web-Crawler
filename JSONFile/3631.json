Cheng also stated that the contracts have been audited by the likes of OpenZeppelin and ChainSecurity.","With the contracts ready, the responsibility for launching Comet now rests with the project\u2019s community. \u201CCompound III is now just a governance proposal away from being live,\u201D wrote Cheng on the DAO\u2019s forum.","The typical procedure here will begin with a governance proposal to launch Comet. The DAO will then debate the launch, followed by an on-chain vote. Comet will go live once the DAO votes to approve its final deployment.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
