OKEx, which launched bitcoin options in December 2019, trails with 8.22% marketshare. FTX, which isn't included in Skew's data, saw 748.8 bitcoin (~7.6M) worth of its product trade over 24-hours, according to data from its website.","","","It is early days, however. And there's no guarantee that Deribit will forever be the options kingmaker.&nbsp;","The bitcoin futures market offers a possible glimpse into Deribit's future. BitMEX, which was once the dominant force in trading of perpetual bitcoin futures, reports volumes that are only slightly above that of OKEx, according to Skew data.&nbsp;","","","Another possible headwind could be Deribit's implementation of new know-your-customer (KYC) requirements for certain customers.","Earlier this year, Deribit announced it would incorporate its business in Panama and expand its KYC requirements for clients looking to withdrawal more than 1 bitcoin within a 24-hour period. The move was implemented on February 10. As such, certain clients are required to submit a passport or government ID. The move reminded some traders of the fate of crypto exchange Poloniex, which saw its marketshare nosedive as it <a href=\"https:\/\/poloniex.com\/press-releases\/2017.12.27-Notice-to-legacy-account-holders\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rolled out KYC standards<\/a> in 2018."],"hashtag":[]}
