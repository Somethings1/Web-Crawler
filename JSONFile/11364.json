This move aims to shore up funds to repay its existing debts and cover its corporate costs. The sale of the notes, which would mature in 2030, could add up to $1 billion to the company's liabilities, bringing its debt to $4 billion.&nbsp;","Upon maturation, the notes are convertible to Coinbase's Class A stock, cash, or a mix of the two forms of redemption. Investors might be able to buy an additional $150 million worth of notes within the first 30 days of the sale.&nbsp;","Coinbase shares traded roughly 2% lower in the after-hours session following the announcement, after having gained 0.78% during normal trading hours, Yahoo Finance data shows.&nbsp;","Nonetheless, the exchange's stock remains up more than 40% in the past year amid a strong rally in crypto prices precipitated by federal regulators' approval of a swath of bitcoin-based investment offerings.&nbsp; Coinbase currently has a market capitalization of $61.58 billion and had $5.4 billion cash on hand as of the end of last year, the company's financial statements show.&nbsp;","However, the exchange is still recuperating from a market implosion that kneecapped crypto prices after the collapse of FTX in November 2022, in addition to the company's ongoing legal battle with regulators in federal court. Last year, Coinbase had $3.1 billion in revenue, down from the roughly $7.8 billion it raked in during the previous crypto bull run in 2021.&nbsp;","&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
