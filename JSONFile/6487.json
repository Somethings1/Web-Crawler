And while his small team represents a tiny fraction of <a href=\"https:\/\/tpicap.com\/tpicap\/sites\/g\/files\/escbpb106\/files\/2023-04\/230327_TPICAP_AR_2022_Web_0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TP ICAP's more than 5,000 staff<\/a>,&nbsp;he\u2019s steadily building it out to meet that demand.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/109952\/tp-icap-crypto-trading-platform-fidelity-standard-chartered-flow-traders\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TP ICAP first announced its plans to set up a cryptoasset exchange<\/a> back in 2021 and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/191215\/tp-icap-gets-fca-approval-to-offer-crypto-services-to-institutional-clients\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">won approval from the UK regulator<\/a> in December of last year. The broker is currently onboarding clients to the platform, known as Fusion Digital Assets, but is yet to announce a formal launch date.","Onboarding takes time because \u2014 to ensure the aforementioned separation of funds \u2014 clients have one relationship with TP ICAP, where trades are executed, and another with Fidelity Digital Assets, a custody partner who keeps their assets secure.","\u201CWe thought it was incredibly important to have that segregation and make sure that the venue isn't holding the funds. And we've obviously seen that play out in the last 18 months \u2014 the reasons why,\u201D Trenholme explained. \u201CFinance has already learned those lessons in its history and therefore we have clear regulation for it in traditional markets.\u201D","As TP ICAP builds out its capacity to offer trading in digital assets, some more \"forward thinking\" clients have been keen to explore the potential. Attracting an audience beyond these early adopters, however, will require crypto to offer a superior experience to traders, Trenholme said.","\u201CUltimately, if it's going to work, it needs to be dramatically better than the way they currently trade.\u201D&nbsp;","According to Trenholme, traditional markets most ripe for improvement by the addition of blockchain technology include bonds, where the cost of settling trades can be high, and carbon credits, where trades sometimes fail to settle at all.","Most carbon credit transactions happen on an over-ther-counter basis between two parties, away from an exchange, he explained. These deals can sometimes fall apart 10 or even 20 days afterwards, because the settlement process \u2014 where the buyer\u2019s cash is officially swapped for the seller\u2019s securities \u2014 is so slow.","TP ICAP isn\u2019t alone is seeing potential for crypto technology to benefit the carbon markets. Professional services giant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ey.com\/en_gl\/news\/2023\/05\/ey-launches-ey-opschain-esg-to-provide-a-trusted-platform-for-emissions-and-carbon-credit-traceability-through-tokenization\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EY last week launched their own Ethereum-based platform<\/a> for enterprises to track their emissions.","For Trenholme, however, the real excitement will start if more businesses start using crypto as the basis for real-world economic activity.","To illustrate what that would look like, he gave the example of an airline deciding to issue NFTs to customers as part of a loyalty program. That airline might suddenly find itself holding a chunk of ether or polygon and then needing to hedge that price in the market \u2014 as they would with their fuel \u2014 to make business planning easier.","Financial markets of the kind TP ICAP runs \u2014 whether commodities, equities, bonds or crypto \u2014 only exist to support and facilitate those real-world business decisions.","\u201CWhen we start to see more firms that come to a wholesale market as a byproduct of doing some form of economic activity where they are essentially using blockchain tech and using using Ethereum or Polygon or whatever as a means of doing something \u2014 I think that's going to be the the sign of growth in the ecosystem,\u201D Trenholme said.","If and when more airlines find themselves needing to hedge their polygon exposure, TP ICAP wants to be right there, ready.","\u201CThere\u2019s this new asset class: crypto. We want to do the same role we do in traditional markets \u2014 which is provide a big secondary market, a professional secondary market \u2014 and we want to do that for crypto.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
