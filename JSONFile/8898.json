The Singapore-based firm claims to have over 300 clients, guard over $100 billion in users' funds, and collectively offer $136 million in bounties to whitehat hackers.","Bounties can be an effective way to discover vulnerabilities and prevent potential hacks, especially in the vulnerable crypto space. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/exploits\/funds-stolen-by-defi-attackers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to The Block's Data Dashboard<\/a>, hackers have stolen nearly $2.5 billion from decentralized finance (DeFi) projects to date.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/exploits\/funds-stolen-by-defi-attackers\/embed\" title=\"Funds stolen by DeFi attackers\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Immunefi claims to have saved over $25 billion in users' funds to date and has paid out $60 million in bounties.","The startup takes a 10% commission on those payouts, founder and CEO Mitchell Amador told The Block. For example, if a whitehat hacker receives $1 million from a crypto project, Immunefi gets $100,000, meaning that the project pays $1.1 million in total, said Amador.","Immunefi can be compared with traditional bug bounty platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd. But the firm says it has facilitated the largest bug bounty payments in the history of software, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/148085\/wormhole-announces-10-million-bug-bounty-payout\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$10 million for a vulnerability discovered in Wormhole<\/a>, a blockchain bridge, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/150500\/aurora-labs-pays-6-million-reward-to-hacker-that-saved-70000-eth-from-getting-stolen\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$6 million for a vulnerability discovered in Aurora<\/a>, a bridge and scaling solution for Ethereum. For comparison, the largest conventional bug bounties \u2014 offered by Apple \u2014 top out at $2 million, according to Immunefi.","With fresh capital in hand, Immunefi plans to expand its team in order to meet the growing demand for its services, said Amador. The current headcount of Immunefi is around 50 and it could double in the near future, he added.","The Series A round brings Immunefi's total funding to date to more than $29.5 million. The firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/122010\/defi-bug-bounty-platform-immunefi-seed-funding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> a $5.5 million seed round last year. Amado declined to comment on Immunefi's valuation with the latest round and any new board seat additions, but said it was an equity round like the firm's seed round.","Last year, Amador told The Block that Immunefi is ready to decentralize its operations, meaning it could launch its own token. When asked if that plan is still intact, he said the firm is \"exploring different options but can't share more at the moment.\"","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
