Genesis Trading, BlockTower and Abra are listed among Talos\u2019 existing clients, according to its website.","\"By integrating with our trading technology, EDX Markets expands its reach and enhances its offerings, bringing a secure, efficient and transparent trading experience to market participants,\u201D Talos co-founder and CEO Anton Katz said. \u201CThis combination will strengthen our collective mission to drive institutional adoption and foster the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets.\"","Backed by major financial players Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab, EDXM was first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169643\/charles-schwab-citadel-fidelity-digital-launch-digital-asset-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> in September. It also has support from Paradigm, Sequoia Capital and Virtu Financial.","Nazarali said the platform would learn from mistakes made by others who tried to attract Wall Street to digital assets in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172104\/edx-markets-ceo-vows-to-learn-from-travails-at-rival-institutional-crypto-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interview<\/a> with The Block at the time. \u201CThere seemed to be a void in the marketplace for a true exchange,\" he said.","EDXM went <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235607\/charles-schwab-citadel-backed-crypto-exchange-goes-live-today-wsj\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">live<\/a> in June, offering trading in four crypto assets: bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash.","In contrast to existing crypto exchanges, EDXM said at launch it would draw on traditional finance standards but operate as a \"non-custodial\" exchange. As such, EDXM doesn\u2019t directly manage users' digital assets, serving as a platform that allows firms to execute trades between crypto and fiat currencies.","Designed to mitigate security risks and conflict of interest concerns over potential misuse of customer funds, actual transfers between parties take place outside of the platform. It expects retail brokerages to route their clients' buy and sell orders to its platform, akin to how the stock market operates. While EDXM plans to launch a clearinghouse later this year to facilitate trade settlement, it intends to utilize third-party banks and a crypto custodian for holding customer assets, it said at the time.","Last month, the exchange also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235607\/charles-schwab-citadel-backed-crypto-exchange-goes-live-today-wsj\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> the closure of a second funding round, with investors including Miami International Holdings and affiliates of proprietary trading firms DV Trading, GTS, GSR and Hudson River Trading.","Â© 2023 The Block.
