A non-custodial exchange built by leveraging the scaling features and speed of the Bitcoin Lightning Network and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Atomic_swap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Atomic_swap\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Atomic Swaps<\/a>.&nbsp;","Griffith founded in Sparkswap in late 2017, leaving his job at a wealth management software firm. He was motivated to start Sparkswap after seeing the first Lightning Network-supported cross-chain swap between bitcoin and litecoin and hearing complaints from cryptocurrency traders.","\u201CThey\u2019re just frustrated by the fact that it takes weeks to pull their money out,\u201D Griffith tells The Block. \u201CBy building Sparkswap on Lightning Network Atomic Swaps, we can get performance and currencies needed to build liquid markets without giving up control of your assets.\u201D","With Sparkswap, which is in beta testing on the Bitcoin mainnet, traders could make trades at speeds comparable to centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini.&nbsp;","Sparkswap has built out an easy to integrate API and command-line interface for traders with technical expertise to incorporate its technology into their backend. Eventually, Griffith notes, Sparkswap will build a platform that can support \u201Cless sophisticated use.\u201D The firm\u2019s initial target clientele are semi-professional to professional traders who want to develop their own custom trading software. \u201CWe think the professional traders are the ones that bring in liquidity,\u201D Griffith adds.","The process to use Sparkswap is as follows:","While Sparkswap initially only supports bitcoin-litecoin trading pairs, Griffith notes that his team is researching ways to enable trading for assets beyond litecoin, including zcash and ether. \u201CWe can support any payment channel network that looks like the Lightning Network,\u201D Griffith tells The Block.","As to why Sparkswap is building a non-custodial exchange on Bitcoin instead of platforms like Ethereum, Griffith notes that it is fundamentally about \u201Cbeing able to support highly liquid trading pairs\u201D and that bitcoin is most liquid cryptocurrency on the market.","To be sure, Sparkswap is not the only startup building exchanges on the Lightning Network. Just last week, <a href=\"https:\/\/boltz.exchange\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Boltz<\/a> announced the alpha release of its \"instant, account free, and non-custodial digital asset exchange built on top of the Lightning Network.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
