However, the most recent data suggests that impact is beginning to subside, with daily outflows falling consecutively over the week, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill wrote.","GBTC\u2019s strong outflows contrast with inflows from the nine newborn spot bitcoin ETFs totaling $1.8 billion last week, led by $744.7 million from BlackRock\u2019s IBIT and $643.2 million from Fidelity\u2019s FBTC. Since launch on Jan. 11, the nine new ETFs have collectively registered around $5.8 billion in inflows and GBTC $5 billion in outflows, leading to a total net inflow of $759.4 million.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows\/embed\" title=\"Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_positive\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      +0.39%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> is down around 14% from a peak of $49,000 the day the spot bitcoin ETFs launched to a current price of $42,252, according to The Block's <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">price page<\/a>. \u201CWe believe that much of the price falls, despite these positive flows, was due to bitcoin seed capital being acquired prior to Jan. 11,\u201D Butterfill said.","Unsurprisingly, bitcoin investment products dominated, witnessing $479 million in net outflows. Short-bitcoin funds attracted further inflows of $10.6 million.","Most altcoin-based funds also registered outflows. Ether investment products saw $39 million in outflows last week, with Polkadot and Chainlink funds losing $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively.","However, Solana products bucked the trend with $3 million worth of inflows, and blockchain equities continued a ten-week inflow streak, adding $17 million.","Regionally, U.S.-based funds dominated with net outflows of $409 million, while Switzerland and Germany witnessed outflows of $60 million and $32 million, respectively. Brazil registered the largest net inflows of $10.3 million.","\u201CRecent price declines prompted by the substantial outflows from the incumbent ETF issuer (Grayscale) in the U.S. totaling $5 billion, have likely prompted further outflows from other regions,\u201D Butterfill said."],"hashtag":["BITCOIN FUTURES ETF","BLACKROCK","INVESTMENT FIRMS","SPOT BITCOIN ETF"]}
