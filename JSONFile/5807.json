Samani believes that NFTs will evolve from their current form of mostly static jpegs and become more dynamic, similar to how Web pages evolved since the early days of the internet.","\"So far in NFTs we don\u2019t really have a lot of \u2018pieces of state\u2019 that have a relationship to one another,\" he said. \"You vaguely have this in the notion that there are 10,000 apes in a collection, but beyond the fact that they all have the \u2018ape tag\u2019 on them, they actually don\u2019t really have a relationship to one another.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSamani used Beeple\u2019s 5000 Days, a collection of 5,000 small NFTs in a 2x2 grid as, an example:","\u201C[MetaKovan] who bought it should introduce some sort of game and say, \u2018if you can assemble 9 of the 5,000 in a square, you unlock something.\u2019 Now you can start to say that these NFTs have relationships to each other in some sort of unique way.\u201D","Another way Samani sees the NFT ecosystem evolving is through the introduction of NFTs that change over time. \u201CToday, NFTs are pristine. With physical art you have transport costs and there is risk of things getting damaged. You could imagine NFTs that actually degrade over time, or degrade when they\u2019re traded.\u201D","While Samani sees a lot of potential for innovation in the NFT design space, he believes that it is \u201Cunlikely\u201D that Multicoin Capital will hold even a 1% position in NFTs. Instead of buying in NFTs directly, Multicoin Capital is investing in the underlying technology.","\u201CThere are three major layers of the stack to think about, and we are investing in two of them,\u201D Kyle said. Those two layers are the 'primitives or infrastructure layer,\u2019 and the second is in NFT exchanges or marketplaces directly. The third layer, outright ownership of NFTs, Samani doesn't currently see as being viable enough for Multicoin Capital to invest in at scale.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro and Samani also discuss:<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
