The business was founded in 2018 by Mike Cagney, former co-founder of the student loans fintech firm SoFi. Figure raised $103m at a $1.2bn valuation in late 2019.","On 6 November 2020, Figure announced that it had applied for a national bank charter from the OCC. Cagney said in a statement that the move was about reducing complexity and helping underserved consumers.","Bank lobbyists, however, argue in their letter that \u201Cthe precedent-shattering approach of granting a national bank charter to an institution that accepts only uninsured deposits would violate the federal law\u201D.","The authors also claim that awarding a bank charter to Figure would carve \u201Ca new pathway to evade\u201D existing regulation.","Another point laboured in the letter is that the public sections of Figure\u2019s charter application do not give interested parties enough detail to properly scrutinise the company and its business plan.","\u201CThe lack of information in the public portion of the application about the key aspects of applicant\u2019s business model and proposed operations raises significant process concerns, and granting this charter would represent a fundamental departure from existing policy by the OCC,\u201D the lobbyists state.","Figure was contacted for comment.","The other organisations which lent their support to the letter were Credit Union National Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions, The Clearing House and The Consumer Bankers Association."],"entity":[{"type":"Credit Union National Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"The Clearing House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"OCC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.2","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"The Consumer Bankers Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Louis Gittleman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$103m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cagney","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mike Cagney","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"American Bankers Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Independent Community Bankers of America, National Association of Federally","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bank Policy Institute","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November 2020","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["OCC"],"authors":["Ryan Weeks","The Block"]}
