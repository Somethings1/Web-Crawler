These loans are provided by banks GrainChain partners with and many recipients are previously unbanked due to a lack of credit history, said Macias. Farmers can use these loans to purchase farming supplies from vendors. According to Macias, a portion of the credits in the digital wallets can also be redeemed for fiat currencies.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meanwhile, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sales of fair trade-certified goods are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/unctad.org\/en\/pages\/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2197\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">growing<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> fast while the fair trade and organic certification models are facing <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">public <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ssir.org\/articles\/entry\/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">scrutiny<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.
