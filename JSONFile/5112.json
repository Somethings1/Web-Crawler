This timeframe hinges on the successful implementation of Ethereum\u2019s upcoming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227746\/ethereum-shapella-cancun-deneb\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cancun upgrade<\/a> (targeted by the end of September). It will also need the finalization of a comprehensive audit process that may take up to four months after Cancun.","To clarify, the audit process won\u2019t start until after Cancun, Koen told The Block.","Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange protocol, is preparing for its next evolution with the release of version 4 (v4), incorporating what are called \"hooks.\" These hooks are smart contracts that will facilitate additional customization in Uniswap's liquidity pools.","In this context, Koen said that the next phase in the v4 development process is the \u2018protocol code frozen\u2019 stage. This stage includes the incorporation of EIP-1153 into the v4 code. Hence the launch is contingent upon the successful integration of EIP-1153 into the Cancun upgrade, which Koen stated could occur as early as September. The security audit is estimated to take between one and four months following the Cancun upgrade.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
