This week\u2019s guest post by Preston Byrne is \u201CPJB\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">[related id=1]U.S. v. Ignatov et al. [PJB]<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/strong><\/em>","As my friends and usual authors of this column Palley and Nelson can attest, long have attorney observers of the cryptocurrency space wondered how the U.S. Department of Justice would deal with allegedly fraudulent ICO schemes.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nTo date, prosecutions of these schemes have been thin on the ground. With perhaps the exception of U.S. v. Homero Joshua Garza, which concerned a late 2014-early 2015 fraudulent bitcoin mining Ponzi scheme that also happened to have a \u201Cpegged stablecoin\u201D called PayCoin attached to it, the DOJ has been remarkably quiet throughout the crypto boom and a perceived slew of what many practitioners argue are major, multibillion-dollar violations of U.S. securities laws. Where the DOJ has gotten involved, usually the charges are limited to garden-variety wire fraud, as in the Garza case, or money laundering, as with Liberty Reserve.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nRarely, if ever, has the DOJ sought to use securities law to restrain allegedly unlawful ICO conduct. With the OneCoin indictments, those days may be over.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nFirst, a bit of background. The OneCoin scheme is alleged to have started at some point in 2014 amid the great altcoin boom (a boom that also led to, inter alia, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum). Among crypto enthusiasts, OneCoin quickly attracted skepticism, for, among other things, the lack of an actual blockchain, the use of MLM-style compensation schemes, and the production of quite obviously fake events on YouTube that made preposterous claims for OneCoin. These claims included a description of the scheme\u2019s founder\u200A\u2014\u200Aa Bulgarian national named Ruja Ignatova\u200A\u2014\u200Aas \u201Cthe founder of cryptocurrency,\u201D despite appearing to know nothing about cryptography, or a representation that OneCoin\u2019s technology\u200A\u2014\u200Aon a slow-ass blockchain\u200A\u2014\u200A\u201Ccan do more transactions than Visa and Mastercard,\u201D which is plainly absurd.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=638_Jpp2Rq8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=638_Jpp2Rq8<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nIt appears the federal government agrees with most of Cryptoland\u2019s assessment, as the DOJ now alleges that the entire scheme was a massive (~$3 billion) fraud. Without going into too much detail, the indictments give us a pretty good idea of what we might expect to see in future prosecutions for unlawful coin offerings.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe scheme\u2019s attorney was indicted in September with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The complaint and indictment against scheme organizers Ignatov and Ignatova, respectively, each include the expected single count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, i.e. scheming to obtain \u201Cmoney and property by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises.\u201D Such as that your blockchain has more throughput than Mastercard, for example.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nIgnatova herself, however, is charged also with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, i.e. concealing and disguising \u201Cthe nature, location, source, ownership and control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity,\u201D and (here it is!) securities fraud, on the basis that, \u201Cin connection with the purchase and sale of securities,\u201D Ignatova \u201Cdid use and employ manipulative and deceptive devices and contrivances,\u201D contrary to Rule 10b-5.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThis suggests that the DOJ thinks it can convince a judge that an ICO token, at least in the case of OneCoin, is a security, applying the ever-popular four-prong test from SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.. If Ignatova\u2019s case goes to trial, we may expect some useful case law on this point. Note, however, that this does not necessarily mean that the DOJ takes the view that every cryptocurrency system is illegitimate or a security. I draw the reader\u2019s attention to footnote 2 in the complaint against Konstantin Ignatov, which contrasts OneCoin with what the FBI describes as \u201Ca legitimate cryptocurrency,\u201D in which \u201Cmining\u2026 [allows] the cryptocurrency\u2019s nodes to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus.\u201D Which is actually a pretty good description of what a cryptocurrency blockchain does.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nLessons here? If the indictment\u2019s allegations are proven to be true, it would mean that OneCoin is among one of the more outrageous, flagrant, and long-running alleged scams in the cryptocurrency business, and only now have the wheels of justice ground their way to an indictment. Yet it still is alleged to have taken in over $3 billion of investors\u2019 money worldwide before those charges became known. Attorneys advising clients on the merits of particular schemes should advise conservatively and confirm that coin offerings have sought to comply with U.S. securities laws, and have fairly and fully disclosed the risks of investment to prospective investors, from day one.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
