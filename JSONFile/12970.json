Having reviewed a draft version of their complaint, which is clearly rehashed from information culled from the internet, we confirm we will be defending ourselves vigorously against this spurious claim.\"","\"BMA has recently emerged as a serial filer of claims against companies operating in the cryptocurrency space, and is widely recognized for operating just like a patent troll,\" the spokesperson added. \"We will deal with this complaint through a normal litigation process and are entirely confident the court will see the claim for what it is.\"","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This story has been updated to attribute the publication of the lawsuit's complaint.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
