The round was led by Polychain Capital and Qiming Venture Partners, valuing the project at $500 million.","In conjunction with the funding, Manta Network has launched the testnet for its Layer 2 solution, Manta Pacific, aimed at developing zero-knowledge (ZK) applications within its modular ZK ecosystem, according to a statement.","The funding will be allocated to expand Manta Pacific and Manta Atlantic, its ZK Layer 1 blockchain for compliant on-chain privacy, the team announced.","\u201CWe are excited to see Manta expanding into the Ethereum ecosystem, and have doubled down on our investment this Series A round,\u201D added Polychain Capital investor Luke Pearson.","Manta claimed that Manta Pacific is the first Ethereum Virtual Machine-native modular execution layer specifically designed for ZK adoption \u2014 providing plug-and-play functionality for developers.","The team added that Manta Pacific utilizes Celestia\u2019s data availability layer for enhanced security and reduced fees. Additionally, it uses a modified version of Optimism\u2019s OP Stack by Caldera for scalability.","\u201CIndividually, Manta Network\u2019s ZK solutions, Celestia\u2019s modular data availability layer and Optimism\u2019s OP Stack have gained substantial traction within our respective spheres,\u201D Manta Network core contributor Kenny Li said. \u201CBy combining these three together, we are creating the best-in-class ecosystem for developers and users when it comes to ZK use cases. This will be instrumental in driving user adoption of ZK products.\u201D","ZK tech is widely seen as one of the most promising solutions to Ethereum\u2019s scalability and privacy challenges, with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162098\/zk-rollups-likely-to-be-main-layer-2-solution-for-ethereum-says-vitalik-buterin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">predicting<\/a> ZK-Rollups will likely become the main Layer 2 solution for the network.","\u201CManta Pacific will leverage the performance capabilities of the modular ecosystem, whilst also allowing increasing access to ZK. We are excited to see ZK adoption grow, bringing throughput and privacy to the ecosystem,\u201D Pearson added.","Manta also argued that while there was increased investor confidence and developer activity in the crypto niche, \u201Cmany existing initiatives remain isolated from end users, who ultimately drive blockchain activity.\"","\u201CWe have seen for the first time the real potential for ZK to onboard substantial user numbers through applied use cases,\u201D Yi Tang, Principal at Qiming Venture Partners said. \u201CWe are looking forward to extending that adoption into web2 as well, and helping Manta Network to enter into the Asia market.\u201D&nbsp;","Manta Pacific's testnet currently offers ZK applications including an on-chain game zkHoldEm, verified credential protocol zkMe and data verification protocol zkPass.","Manta claims that its native Manta Wallet has been installed over 200,000 times and that its combined project ecosystem reaches more than 1.5 million users.","Â© 2023 The Block.
