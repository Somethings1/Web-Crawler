Liquid staking unlocks the value of staked crypto via staking derivative tokens that stakers can deploy on other DeFi protocols.","According to today\u2019s announcement, Lido is bringing staked ETH (stETH) to Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 DeFi space. Staked ETH is the staking derivative token users receive in exchange for staking their ETH via Lido.","Lido has already integrated with both Aztec and Argent. The former is a privacy-focused Layer 2 network that uses zk-rollup while the latter is a Layer 2 wallet provider that uses zkSync.","Zk-rollup stands for zero-knowledge rollups and is a Layer 2 scalability solution that allows faster and cheaper transaction processing than on the Ethereum mainnet. ZkSync is an application of the zk-rollup technology.","Lido says its first foray into Layer 2 will begin by offering support for wrapped stETH (wstETH). With support for Aztec and Argent, zkSync users will be able to bridge and stake wsETH on supported Layer 2 networks. To bridge in crypto means to move coins across different networks.","Monday\u2019s announcement also stated that Lido has plans to expand its Layer 2 footprint. These plans include allowing direct ETH staking on Layer 2 without bridging their assets back to the Ethereum mainnet.","Lido is already the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/152516\/why-ethereums-dominant-liquid-staking-protocol-is-debating-whether-to-reduce-its-influence\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dominant liquid staking platform on Ethereum<\/a>. The platform accounts for almost a third of all ether tokens staked on Ethereum 2.0. Lido Finance recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/155070\/lido-community-strongly-against-limiting-its-ethereum-staking-dominance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">voted against a proposal<\/a> to limit the protocol\u2019s share of the ETH2 staking pool.","Â© 2023 The Block.
