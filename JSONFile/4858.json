Similarly, the conversations, developments, and innovations at Router Protocol are essentially building the foundation for empowering developers to build seamless cross-chain products with excellent user experiences a few years from now.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Router has facilitated over $300 million in cross-chain swaps and transfers with just over $500k in bridge liquidity. The high level of capital efficiency shows that a large bridge TVL is not needed for the majority of the transactions on the bridge. Unlike AMMs or lending platforms, bridges do not offer better quotes with high TVL but instead act as a honeypot for hackers.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Voyager:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>","<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This was the first B2C offering released by Router Protocol in January this year. Voyager is a cross-chain swap engine built on Router Protocol that supports cross-chain swaps and asset transfers.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moreover, Voyager is powered by Router Protocol\u2019s proprietary PathFinder Algorithm that is integrated with 1inch API. The PathFinder Algorithm traverses multiple DEXes to find the fastest and most economical routes to execute cross-chain swaps and transfers. 90% of the transactions conducted on Voyager were completed within 90 seconds. The efficiency and scalability of Voyager catapulted Router Protocol to being categorised as one of the top performing dApps on Polygon on metrics like transaction volume and speed.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Router Widget:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Router Protocol has abstracted the bridge to provide a fully customisable white labelled solution in the form of an easily integratable widget. This would allow Web 3.0 projects to empower their users with the functionality of conducting cross-chain swaps\/transfers without leaving their platform.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With Router Widget, users can set up default networks on the bridge, customise the widget to match their UI, set biases for encouraging users to make favourable transactions, and most importantly make their dApp more inclusive to users with different native chains. It\u2019s a low code solution for adding cross-chain functionalities to any dApp.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pathfinder API and JS SDK:&nbsp;<\/strong>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Router Protocol has abstracted its proprietary PathFinder Algorithm into an AssetSwap API and JS SDK. The API and the SDK provide the entire asset-swap functionality of Voyager on any Web 3.0 platform with a simple integration. For e.g., just like MetaMask provides the capability of same chain swaps inside its interface, by integrating our SDK, any wallet provider can provide the functionality to perform cross-chain swaps inside their platform. It is a completely white labelled solution with its documentation available <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dev.routerprotocol.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">here<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.

However, if your application is a website built on React tech stack, we would recommend using JS SDK for a more seamless integration experience.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CrossTalk Library:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CrossTalk Library is a complete abstraction of Router Protocol\u2019s cross-chain communication infrastructure. It is a plug and play framework that allows users to build cross-chain applications using the Router infrastructure.
