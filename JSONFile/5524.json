The index has amassed over $1 billion in assets under management since its launch in 2019.&nbsp;","The transaction, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.co.uk\/news-releases\/coinshares-to-acquire-global-blockchain-equity-index-809699538.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced this morning<\/a>, will be settled through an equity swap, for which CoinShares will issue 1,298,322 new ordinary shares at a price of $13.09 per share. Elwood\u2019s equity research team will also join CoinShares as part of the deal.","The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/108122\/billionaire-alan-howard-crypto-investments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">revealed in June<\/a> that Elwood had pivoted away from fund management to focus on software.

His investments include British crypto payments app Bottlepay, Cologne-based neobroker Nextmarkets, recently launched crypto exchange Bullish Global and Komainu, the Jersey-regulated crypto custodian backed by Nomura.","Â© 2023 The Block.
