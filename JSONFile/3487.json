The addresses posted \u2013 for bitcoin as well as ether\/USDT \u2013 remained consistent, though the wording of the appeals changed in each iteration. It is unclear whether the messages were purposefully deleted and reposted or if the inclusion of cryptocurrency addresses triggered controls put in place by Twitter following the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/71779\/crypto-exchanges-binance-and-geminis-twitter-accounts-compromised-used-to-promote-scam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2020 account hacks<\/a>.","The donation addresses were also shared by vice prime minister Mykhailo Fedorov's verified Twitter account as well as in his verified Telegram channel.","When reached via a <a href=\"https:\/\/thedigital.gov.ua\/contacts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">press contact email<\/a> listed on its website, The Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation, which Fedorov leads, told The Block that \"the communications channels of the Ministry Of Digital Transformation of Ukraine and Minister Mykhailo Fedorov are secure.
