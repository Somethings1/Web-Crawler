Appearing on the list is simply an indication that an agent bank has requested a DTCC identifier for an ETF fund, and that DTCC may process that transaction at an undetermined date in the future following SEC approval,\" the spokesperson continued.","\"Appearing on the list is not indicative of an outcome for any outstanding regulatory or other approval processes in respect of a particular ETF fund,\" they added. \"BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF was added to the file in August 2023. We look forward to supporting our clients as they add offerings, and the digitization of financial markets continues.\"","\"DTCC is def not used to this kind of attn or action, it lives behind scenes, very boring.
