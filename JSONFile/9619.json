With the current state of the bear market, a very lean team will be maintained going forward,\u201D a Huobi spokesperson told The Block, adding: \u201CThe personnel optimization aims to implement the brand strategy, optimize the structure, improve efficiency and return to the top three.\u201D","The confirmation comes roughly a week after journalist Colin Wu first <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WuBlockchain\/status\/1608774459124781059?s=20&amp;t=c99c55iaBDTgpAm7nskqTg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> layoffs at the crypto exchange on Dec. 30.

Huobi\u2019s spokesperson said that it is incorrect that bonuses and benefits have been cut, however.&nbsp;","Huobi was acquired by About Capital Management\u2019s M&amp;A fund on Oct. 7. Days later, Tron founder Justin Sun was named an advisor to Huobi. Speculation abounded that he was, in fact, the actual buyer behind the About Capital deal, but Sun repeatedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175867\/justin-sun-denies-being-real-buyer-of-huobi-stake-sale-exclusive\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">denied<\/a> those claims in email correspondence with The Block.
