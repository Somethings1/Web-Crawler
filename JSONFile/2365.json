This might seem like free money, but it\u2019s a trap. If the recipients spent the tokens, it can enable the perpetrator to steal any Thorchain (RUNE) tokens they happen to own.","\"This is a unique exploit that has rarely been used in recent years. But since the attack is so underhanded, it could be quite effective,\" explained The Block Research\u2019s Eden Au.","What\u2019s happening is the perpetrator has been airdropping UniH tokens to at least 76,000 Ethereum addresses. The intention is that recipients will see these free tokens and try to sell them on a decentralized exchange.","But these tokens come with a malicious contract. And if the person does indeed sell their newly received UniH tokens (or even just approves them to be sold), then the perpetrator can also steal any RUNE tokens they possess in their wallet.","This is able to happen because RUNE tokens use a non-standard token contract, called \u201Ctx.origin.\u201D This specific token contract is not used in the ERC-20 token standard \u2014 used by most Ethereum-based tokens \u2014 because of its risks.&nbsp;","What happens is that the UniH tokens carry malicious code that will automatically transfer the user\u2019s RUNE tokens to another wallet (presumably owned by the perpetrator) if approved.&nbsp;","The only thing it needs is for the user to \u201Ccall\u201D the contract (i.e. set it in motion). But if the user goes to a decentralized exchange to sell the UniH tokens, it does exactly that \u2014 automatically displacing their RUNE tokens.","According to Thorchain\u2019s RUNE token contract code, it was aware that this type of attack could happen. \u201CBeware phishing contracts that could steal tokens by intercepting tx.origin,\u201D it <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/0xedenau\/status\/1418585105686089729\/photo\/1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">states<\/a>, when referring to the approval of transactions.","This exploit comes on the same day that Thorchain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/112308\/thorchain-suffers-8-million-loss-by-hacker-wanting-to-teach-lesson\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suffered its third exploit<\/a> in a month. The network for running cross-chain swaps has now lost a total of $13 million due to a variety of bugs. Supporters maintain that it\u2019s still in a kind of beta form \u2014 albeit with real money \u2014 and that bugs are expected; hence why they affectionately refer to the network as a \u201CChaosnet.\u201D"],"hashtag":["AIRDROP"]}
