The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) would be responsible for authorizing these firms, which would also need to adhere to stringent requirements, including admission standards for crypto exchanges and mandatory disclosures for new asset listings.","The new proposals are in addition to the UK\u2019s new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233554\/fca-to-roll-out-stricter-rules-for-crypto-ads-including-referral-bonus-ban\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto advertising rules<\/a>, regulated by the FCA, which came into effect on Oct. 8, and compliance requirements with the Financial Action Task Force's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/248638\/travel-rule-regulation-comes-into-force-in-the-uk-for-crypto-asset-firms\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Travel Rule<\/a>, which began on Sept. 1.","Notably, the proposals left out regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi), with the UK Treasury acknowledging that it is too early and potentially ineffective to regulate DeFi at this stage.&nbsp;","\u201CPeople love to whinge, but there is actually much to praise here,\u201D Linch said. \u201CObviously, there is still detail to come, and a long way to go, but the UK has set out its stall.\u201D","In June, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak expressed a desire to provide regulatory clarity regarding how crypto businesses should register and operate in the UK, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234095\/a16z-uk-expansion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announcing<\/a> plans to turn the country into a web3 hub.","\u201CThere is much in the government\u2019s response that suggests that this will be achieved in the UK, bringing the certainty that institutional investors and corporates will need to set up shop or relocate their operations, priming the UK to fulfill its ambition of becoming a much sought-after crypto hub,\u201D Linch concluded.","Â© 2023 The Block.
