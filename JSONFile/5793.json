Thus, it makes sense to clearly make FXS holders\u2019 desire public knowledge through governance,\u201D the proposal states, referring to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/price\/frax-share\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">frax share<\/a> governance token by its ticker FXS.","If passed by the DAO, Frax will liquidate all tokens on any Ethereum PoW forks and keep the funds in its treasury to honor stablecoin redemptions by users.","The proposal also marks Frax as the first decentralized stablecoin issuer to offer public support for ETH2 \u2014 although Tether chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino has <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/paoloardoino\/status\/1553702442348453894\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> that its centralized stablecoin will support ETH2.","The potential for the Ethereum merge being contested via hard forks has significant implications for stablecoins \u2014 because such forks typically double the number of tokens as the chain splits. This situation is especially concerning for fiat-backed stablecoins as the supply increase would affect their ability to maintain their US dollar peg.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
