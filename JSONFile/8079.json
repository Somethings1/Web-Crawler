This is in contrast to how DAOs are started and operated currently, which require heavy engineering infrastructure.","DAOs grew in popularity in 2021 as a way for groups to decentralized decision-making and work toward common goals, such as fundraising. They use digital assets to vote on decisions and outcomes, versus having the hierarchical decision-making structure of traditional organizations.","More DAOs will likely pop up this year as ways to build web3 startups, investment groups, NFT and metaverse projects, and social clubs, said Lifshits.","\u201CWhile at the start of the year there are 10 to 20 thousand operating DAOs, we expect up to 1 million new DAOs to be formed by the year\u2019s end,\u201D said the company.","Superdao itself is currently operating as a traditional company but has ambitions to become a DAO itself. \u201CIt will take time to do it properly,\u201D said Lifshits. It\u2019s a similar path for many web3 startups, who start off with C-crop type private equity to win time to fully prepare for a token-based system, he said.","Backers of the investment round include funds AllianceDAO, Signal Fire, Pear VC, DIGITAL and One Block Capital.
