Falling crypto prices led to $650 million in longs being liquidated since April 17.","Bitcoin, and the broader crypto market, fell consistently throughout the week after a sharp sell-off on Tuesday. As a result, long positions across derivatives exchanges saw the largest liquidations so far this year. The liquidations continued to cascade through to Sunday.&nbsp;","About $650 million in longs were liquidated, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/futures\/long-liquidations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a> from The Block.
