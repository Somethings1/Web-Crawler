Deribit, CoinFLEX, and Bybit could be next, the source said.","A quick search on the FCA's website didn't show that the three exchanges are registered.","Deribit CEO John Jansen told The Block that the exchange is not actively seeking clients in the U.K. or is not actively promoting its services in the country, so \u201Cthere is no problem at all.\u201D","\u201CTo actively offer Deribit services in any other country in the EU would also require registration with the relevant authorities or being regulated. To make it clear: this would be needed in every single country where actively seeking clients. So instead of registering with every authority in the EU, Deribit simply does not actively engage in approaching prospective clients in the EU or operate from the EU,\u201D Jansen added.","As for FCA warnings, Jansen said these are to make citizens aware of non-regulated exchanges. \u201CThis is nothing special,\u201D he said, reiterating: \u201CAs long as a non-regulated exchange is not actively promoting or operating on UK grounds, there should be no problem.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nNotably, Deribit currently does not serve in the U.S. When asked why the exchange hasn't yet blocked U.K. clients, Jansen said it is \"not needed\" as the U.S., the U.K. and the EU do not have the same laws.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\"The U.S. is more aggressive in the sense that their laws state that 'accepting US clients on a non-US regulated platform' can be seen as a crime. Instead in the U.K. or the EU, it simply is not allowed to promote the platform or to operate it from its territory, but if an EU or UK citizen seeks to trade on Deribit, that is allowed, as long as we do not actively try to convince him to do so \/ actively market the platform in the EU or the U.K.,\" Jansen added.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe Block has reached out to CoinFLEX and Bybit for comments and will update this story should we hear back.","Last month, the FCA <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fca.org.uk\/news\/news-stories\/fca-becomes-aml-and-ctf-supervisor-uk-cryptoasset-activities\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">became<\/a> a compliance supervisor of crypto activities in the U.K. As a result, all existing and new crypto businesses are required to be registered by the watchdog.
