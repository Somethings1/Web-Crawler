Those backers include Polychain, Greenfield One, Huobi Incubator, Tioga Capital, Eden Block, NGC Ventures, HashKey Capital, Figment, Fenbushi Capital, OKX Blockdream Ventures, Tayssir Capital, KR1, Lemniscap and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).","Grants under the program will range from roughly $50,000 to several million dollars, according to Nym\u2019s CEO, Harry Halpin. Nym has not taken in the full $300 million up front, but instead plans to draw on the commitments it has received when necessary.&nbsp;","\u201CWe want to incentivize open source and decentralized developers who we don\u2019t know to start building on this network,\u201D said Halpin in an interview with The Block.","Halpin described Nym as a \u201Cdecentralized mixing network\u201D which uses blockchain technology to mix the so-called packets \u2014 containing potentially sensitive metadata \u2014 generated by all internet transactions, including cryptocurrency trades. Haplin said Nym\u2019s mixnet technology shuffles these packets like a deck of cards, preventing even an \u201CNSA [National Security Agency] level adversary\u201D from determining who might be behind them.","Nym\u2019s platform has a potentially wide range of use cases \u2014 not all of them in crypto. It could, for example, be used by messaging app Signal to scramble packets connected to communication. The company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/124687\/a16z-leads-13-million-funding-round-for-privacy-tech-startup-nym\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $13 million<\/a> in a round led by a16z in November last year, bringing its valuation to $270 million.","The launch of the Nym Innovation Fund comes just a few weeks after Nym launched its token across a number of exchanges including OKX and Huobi. Privacy advocate Edward Snowden spoke at the launch event.","While similar in some ways to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/118150\/ethereum-challengers-are-dangling-token-rewards-to-attract-big-name-defi-projects-and-its-working\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mammoth incentive funds<\/a> rolled out in recent months by Ethereum challengers like Avalanche and Algorand, the Nym Innovation Fund doesn\u2019t offer \"liquidity mining\" rewards.","Halpin explained that the Nym mixnet is somewhat similar to Bitcoin in terms of its incentive structure, except that nodes mix packets in exchange for rewards in NYM, instead of solving puzzles in exchange for bitcoin.","The $300 million committed to the developer fund by venture capital firms will be boosted, over time, by allocations of NYM from the company\u2019s treasury as those tokens begin to unlock, according to Halpin. Indeed, the first batch of grants made under the new development initiative \u2014 which began to be distributed a few weeks ago \u2014 were funded by Nym itself.","They went to Carmela Troncoso, co-inventor of a privacy-enhanced COVID-19 contact tracing framework; cryptography expert Daniel Bernstein, who will be working on speeding up Nym\u2019s packet format; Tails, the software used by Edward Snowden to leak NSA secrets; and Nymbox, hardware designed by the community that plans to use Nym\u2019s technology to keep computer traffic private.","A group of cryptography experts will preside over dishing out the grants. They are ex-Meta employee George Danezis; Aggelos Kiayias of IO Global and University of Edinburgh; Ben Laurie of Google; and KU Leuven\u2019s Bart Preneel.&nbsp;","These four form the basis of a newly formed Nym Foundation, which will publish an open call for proposals in late May. To apply, developers simply pitch their ideas to the panel.","In a statement in Nym\u2019s announcement, Halpin said that though the new fund seems large, \u201Cit\u2019s a drop in the ocean compared to the endless amounts of cash possessed by vested interests at Silicon Valley companies and nation-states that benefit from mass surveillance.\u201D","He added: \u201CWe have new partners that are waiting in the wings to join the fund that we can't even announce in this initial fund. I'm just thrilled that developers now can finally get paid for building privacy-enhancing technologies.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
