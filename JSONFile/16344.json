Not long after, Fortune said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is waging a campaign to classify the Ethereum blockchain's native token as a security, beginning a probe after Ethereum moved to a proof-of-stake network in 2022.","In the aftermath, ETH dropped to $3,200. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, dropped to around $62,000 after bouncing to near $64,000 earlier. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) fell 3%.","\"I do think this relates to the ETF \u2026 The SEC has been in an untenable position for some time with its position on ETH,\u201D said Scott Johnson, general partner at Van Buran Capital in a post on X. \u201CThis is in my opinion either an attempt to maintain its ambiguity for just a bit longer or the SEC is going nuclear option.\u201D","Designating ETH as a security could complicate efforts to create ether ETFs in the U.S. The SEC has a May deadline to decide on approval.
