They acknowledge that they have commercial paper, but they don\u2019t disclose what exactly that is. That\u2019s where I think that a framework that compels disclosure does provide investor protection.\u201D","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Referring to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/118254\/judge-denies-ripples-request-for-sec-crypto-trading-disclosures\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">controversial Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement action<\/a>, Davidson said: \u201CRegulators ought to get their arms around Tether. There\u2019s, frankly, more reason for the SEC to be looking at Tether than for them to be looking at Ripple and XRP.\u201D<\/span>","Especially significant is the fact that Davidson is far from an alarmist when it comes to crypto policy. He has, rather, been one of crypto's biggest advocates on the Hill since replacing John Boehner as the representative for Ohio's 8th district in 2016.&nbsp;","Davidson is a member of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus as well as the House Financial Services Committee, which later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/132827\/house-and-senate-hearings-on-stablecoins-will-spotlight-official-behind-treasury-report-sources\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">today will be reviewing a report<\/a> on stablecoins from the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. Nellie Liang, the Treasury's undersecretary for domestic finance, will be guiding that hearing, likely to push for the PWG's request that Congress limit stablecoin issuance to insured depository institutions \u2014 meaning banks, primarily.","It's a framework that has received bipartisan pushback. Davidson, for example, was not on board with the restriction to insured depository institutions. Democratic staffers have likewise noted that their representatives don't like the idea of advantaging incumbent banks.","But while the specific framework for regulating stablecoins remains unsettled, Tether, the largest stablecoin operator, remains the proverbial elephant in the room. Long criticized for its approach to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/114954\/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-stablecoin-wars\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> operational transparency<\/a>, Tether has also been notably absent from policy discussions within the US, even those <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/126866\/what-we-learned-at-congress-much-anticipated-summit-of-crypto-execs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">that involve competing stablecoin issuers<\/a>.&nbsp;","Sherrod Brown, the Senate Banking Committee's chair, recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/125273\/senate-banking-committee-chair-seeks-answers-on-stablecoins-from-centre-paxos-and-more\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ran into issues contacting Tether<\/a> over their practices.
