At the meeting, Argo\u2019s employees \u201Cinadvertently disclosed certain information that could be viewed as material non-public information under U.S. securities laws or inside information under U.K. securities laws,\u201D according to the filing. Coyle then published that information on Twitter \u2014 a post that has since been deleted.","Argo is listed on the London Stock Exchange in the United Kingdom and on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/117601\/crypto-miner-argo-blockchain-ipo-nasdaq\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the Nasdaq Global Market<\/a> in the United States. Its current market capitalization is Â£573 million (roughly $770 million).","The publication of the potential costs of constructing the mining facility in Texas comes just a few months after <a href=\"https:\/\/theboatmancapital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Argo-Blockchain-090821_.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a damning report<\/a> from short-seller Boatman Capital, which focused on the land on which the facility will be built.","Boatman argued that Argo\u2019s $17.5 million purchase of the plot of land in question had been overpaid for by a factor of up to 100 times. &nbsp;In a video shared on social media at the time, Argo\u2019s CEO Peter Wall defended the purchase as \u201Ca very solid deal\u201D and a \u201Cproject acquisition.\u201D","In this morning\u2019s filing, Argo stated that the $1.5-2 billion range is based on \u201Cnumerous assumptions,\u201D including the type of machines used at the facility, the mix of owned and hosted machines, raw material costs, labour and power costs, and when construction begins.","\u201CThe actual costs for Argo to build and kit out the Helios facility in Texas will also depend on the extent to which Argo decides to fully develop the property, which has not yet been determined,\u201D said Argo in the filing.&nbsp;\u201CEach of the foregoing assumptions is subject to numerous inherent risks and uncertainties, and, as a result, future results could differ materially from the estimated range above.\u201D","In his post on Twitter, Coyle stated that Argo claimed it had achieved a 25% uplift in hash rate from the use of immersion cooling technology. Argo denied making the claim in its filing.","During the meeting, the company\u2019s representatives told Coyle that Argo could, in the future, make up to 20% of its revenues from currencies other than bitcoin \u2014 its main focus at present. In this morning\u2019s filing, Argo clarified that this was not intended as a forecast but as \u201Cdirectional insight.\u201D","Another claim made by Argo\u2019s representatives was that it had seen a 500% return on its investment in Equihash machines purchased in June 2020. \u201CThis statement was made to illustrate that return on investment can vary greatly, and this was a particularly favorable example,\u201D said Argo in the filing.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":[]}
