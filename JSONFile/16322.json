For those who don\u2019t, CBDCs are digital forms of national currencies, issued by a country\u2019s central bank. The United States Federal Reserve has no plans to issue a digital dollar. Yet, potential presidential candidates in next year\u2019s U.S. election are already sounding an alarm.","\u201CExpect this CBDC issue to become a presidential campaign talking point,\u201D said Ron Hammond, director of government relations at Blockchain Association. \u201CPerfect intersection of fear of government, China and finance collapse with the bank crisis.\u201D","Indeed, a number of potential presidential candidates have recently taken a strong stance against CBDCs. Opponents paint a future digital dollar as a government attempt to monitor and even control citizen transactions. A CBDC could theoretically be designed so it could be used for certain items but not others. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a likely Republican contender, suggested that the U.S. government could use a CBDC to restrict purchases of gas or prevent you from buying too many rifles.","Emily Parker is CoinDesk's executive director of global content.","DeSantis went as far as to propose legislation to ban the use of CBDCs in Florida. \u201CThe Biden administration\u2019s efforts to inject a Centralized Bank Digital Currency is about surveillance and control,\u201D DeSantis said in the press release. Just this week, the bill passed the Florida legislature. Then, on Wednesday, North Carorlina's House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill banning digital dollar payments to the state.","Another potential presidential candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democrat, used similar language to DeSantis' to oppose CBDCs. \u201CWe should be wary since CBDCs are the ultimate mechanisms for social surveillance and control,\u201D he said.","Yet, another possible candidate, Republican Vivek Ramaswamy, recently tweeted, \u201CEvery GOP candidate needs a clear answer to CBDCs: hell no.\u201D","While Kennedy\u2019s statement demonstrates that anti-CBDC sentiment isn\u2019t a purely partisan issue, it does appear to be an increasingly popular Republican talking point. In March, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show to explain why she vetoed a central bank digital currency bill. The video was featured in a Fox News opinion piece titled, \u201CPoliticians are quietly preparing for a digital dollar. It\u2019s not good for your freedom.\u201D","Other well-known Republican politicians have voiced their skepticism of CBDCs, while stopping short of proposing an outright ban. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for example, introduced legislation to prohibit the Federal Reserve from unilaterally creating a direct-to-consumer CBDC. The bill was co-sponsored by Sens. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).","In February, Majority Whip Republican Tom Emmer of Minnesota introduced in the House of Representatives the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. \u201CAny digital version of the dollar must uphold our American values of privacy, individual sovereignty and free market competitiveness,\u201D Emmer said. \u201CAnything less opens the door to the development of a dangerous surveillance tool.\u201D","Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) also recently issued a condemnation of states\u2019 legalizing CBDCs. \u201CGovernments around the world are taking steps to establish a Chinese-style, centralized currency that would give the government more control over our lives,\u201D Davidson said.","The urgency of some of this language might give the impression that a digital dollar is right around the corner, but that is far from the case.","It\u2019s true that more than 100 countries are exploring a CBDC, with 11 countries having already launched one. China\u2019s digital yuan is the most famous example. But the United States has been very cautious about the idea of issuing a digital dollar, largely because of privacy concerns. The current U.S. position is essentially, we should give this more thought.","Last year, a Biden Administration executive order directed the U.S. government \u201Cto assess the technological infrastructure and capacity needs for a potential U.S. CBDC in a manner that protects Americans' interests.\u201D Late last year, MIT and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston completed their own \u201Cagnostic\u201D CBDC research. This year, Treasury Undersecretary Nellie Liang said that policymakers are still deliberating about whether to have a CBDC and, if so, what form it would take. \u201CThe Fed has also emphasized that it would only issue a CBDC with the support of the executive branch and Congress, and more broadly the public,\u201D Liang said.","It is also likely that CBDC use would be intermediated by the private sector, rather than managed directly by the Federal Reserve. \u201CAn intermediated model would facilitate the use of the private sector's existing privacy and identity-management frameworks,\u201D according to the Fed.","These statements are not enough to appease CBDC opponents, however. In April, the Federal Reserve tweeted that it has made no decision on issuing a central bank digital currency and \u201Cwould not do so without clear support from Congress and executive branch, ideally in the form of a specific authorizing law.\u201D DeSantis and others jumped on the word \u201Cideal\u201D to cast skepticism on the Fed\u2019s claim.","Congress has been talking about CBDCs since at least 2021 when Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote a letter to the Federal Reserve urging research on a U.S. CBDC, said Jennifer Lassiter, executive director of the Digital Dollar Project. The Digital Dollar Project is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization devoted to catalyzing private sector research and experimentation of a potential US CBDC. \u201CSince then the dialogue has ebbed and flowed with a more recent bump in attention as a result of proposed anti-CBDC legislation in Congress and political speeches by republican candidates,\u201D Lassiter said.","What\u2019s notable about the Republican opposition is that it\u2019s not entirely clear who\u2019s on the other side. \u201CWhile it's true there\u2019s a Republican opposition, there\u2019s not necessarily a strong Democratic support,\u201D said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center.","There are some exceptions, of course. Rep. Jim Himes (D- Connecticut) proposed a U.S. CBDC and outlined some of the benefits. But Democrats are hardly rallying around a pro-digital dollar agenda. In fact, it\u2019s not clear if anyone really is.","\u201CThere aren\u2019t a lot of CBDC champions. Even the Fed themselves have said, very cautiously, we\u2019re studying it, better to get it right than get it first,\u201D said Lipsky. A Fed paper on the topic outlined both benefits and downsides, while noting that preserving privacy was a key consideration.","So why are people getting so worked up about this now? A number of politicians with similar talking points might suggest some influence by consultants, lobbyists or other outside groups. The Cato Institute, for example, has been very vocal in its opposition to CBDCs. Cato published a paper and also polled Americans about their views on CBDCs and found that most people were unfamiliar with them. Another group that would have an interest in opposing CBDCs are U.S. stablecoin issuers. USDC issuer Circle, for one, has been outspoken about its opposition to CBDCs.","Criticism of China, a familiar subject in U.S. presidential elections, comes up again and again in anti-CBDC talking points. \u201CCentralized currency provides an avenue for the controlling entity to push an agenda. This is exactly what China is doing with its centralized digital currency,\u201D DeSantis\u2019 press secretary, Bryan Griffin, said.","Rep. Emmer\u2019s bill was co-sponsored by nine Republicans, several of whom directly mentioned China. \u201CThe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s move to use government-run digital currency to impose further control on its people and its economy is a cautionary tale that America must avoid,\u201D said Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska.","China is indeed the most visible champion of this technology. While the digital yuan is still far from ubiquitous in China, it still covers 13.6 billion RMB, 260 million wallets and 25 cities, according to Ananya Kumar at the Atlantic Council. It may not be so scary to think of a CBDC as one form of payment, co-existing alongside cash, stablecoins and decentralized cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. But China\u2019s CBDC project is so ambitious that it\u2019s not impossible to conceive of Beijing pulling levers to incentivize citizens to primarily rely on digital yuan.","China\u2019s Central Bank has claimed that privacy is an important consideration for its digital yuan. But extensive reports of Chinese surveillance have led to skepticism in this area.","It is extremely unlikely, of course, that a theoretical digital dollar would be identical to a digital yuan. And some would argue that China\u2019s ambitions should light a fire under Washington, D.C. Digital Dollar Project co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Giancarlo, a speaker at CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus festival, argues the U.S. has an opportunity to lead with a digital currency that protects privacy rather than encourages surveillance.","It\u2019s not just China, of course. DeSantis\u2019 criticism of CBDCs goes hand in hand with larger criticism of the Federal Reserve and of the Biden administration in general. \u201CThe track record of the establishment throughout [COVID-19] and under this administration speaks for itself and leaves plenty of room for concern,\u201D Griffin, DeSantis\u2019 press secretary, said. He also pointed to Canada, mentioning the freezing of bank accounts of Canadian protestors during the so-called Freedom Convoy in February 2022.","DeSantis also depicted CBDCs as an example of Davos elites backdooring \u201Cwoke ideology\u201D such as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investment frameworks into the U.S. financial system.","While the CBDC issue is likely to come up in the 2024 presidential campaign cycle, it is hard to imagine it becoming a central issue. It is even harder to imagine even a single American voter casting a ballot based on this issue. But that doesn\u2019t mean the political debate won\u2019t have a discernible effect. The most immediate impact could be on research.","\u201CExperimentation and innovation is happening around CBDC with U.S. companies,\u201D Lassiter of the Digital Dollar Project said. But \u201Cperhaps the sharing of the results of that experimentation is limited and slowed in a politically divisive environment. Innovation is continuing, the question is whether companies are willing to lead on experimentation for a U.S. CBDC if there is political disagreement about the need for research at all.\u201D","\u201CIt\u2019s very important to be cognizant and work diligently on the privacy issues,\u201D said Lipsky of the Atlantic Council. \u201CI hope that this discourse doesn\u2019t have a chilling effect on the Fed\u2019s research.\u201D","At the very least, raising CBDCs to the level of national politics will bring more Americans into the conversation. Even if some of the digital dollars discussed on the campaign trail will bear little resemblance to anything that would ever exist.","Edited by Ben Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"Ron DeSantis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nellie Liang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Dakota","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sherrod Brown","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Robert F.
