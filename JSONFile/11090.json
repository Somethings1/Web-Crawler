Dymension's Layer 2 rollup will be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a computing environment used by Ethereum. The rollup aims to enable developers to write and deploy Ethereum applications, a task that is typically challenging due to differences in code between Cosmos and Ethereum.","Currently in the testing phase, Dymension's rollup will be launched as a Layer 2 solution on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/143771\/evmos-launches-blockchain-to-bring-ethereum-virtual-machine-to-cosmos\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Evmos<\/a>, a blockchain within the Cosmos ecosystem, according to an announcement. The company cites close collaboration with the Evmos core team and a data availability protocol called Celestia.","\"We're excited to have worked closely with the Evmos team to achieve this milestone. With the world's first IBC-enabled EVM rollup now deployed on the testnet, we're one step closer to bringing scalable and interoperable blockchain solutions to the wider community,\" Yishay Harel, Dymension Lab's CEO and co-founder, said in the statement. IBC refers to the <a href=\"https:\/\/tutorials.cosmos.network\/academy\/3-ibc\/1-what-is-ibc.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol<\/a>, which handles authentication and data transfer between two Cosmos blockchains.","Adopting a modular approach, Dymension's team plans to create multiple EVM-compatible rollups using a common software development kit, enabling them to operate on top of various Cosmos chains and communicate with those chains.","This is made possible by the IBC-enabled nature of Dymension's rollups, allowing for native connections with the entire Cosmos ecosystem of IBC blockchains without the need for bridges.","Â© 2023 The Block.
