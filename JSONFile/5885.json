DST Global Partners and Breyer Capital were named as investors among other unnamed institutions, although Binance itself still contributed the bulk of the $500 million.","A significant chunk of the contribution made by outside backers or Limited Partners (LPs), however, was returned over the summer, according to three people familiar with the matter. One of those people said that of the total $150 million invested in the Binance Labs fund by LPs, close to half was repaid. That capital had yet to be deployed into startup investments, they added.","A spokesperson for Binance declined to comment.&nbsp;","Binance Labs has emerged as one of the largest venture investors in crypto off the back of the exchange operator\u2019s success.","It was formed in 2018 to pour Binance\u2019s excess profits into startups and by April this year it had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/228565\/binance-labs-yibo-ling-investments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">grown into an investment and incubation arm with $9 billion in assets<\/a>, according to statements made by company spokespeople at the time. It has backed over 200 projects and, as of April, had delivered returns on paper of more than 10 times what it had invested.","It is unclear exactly why the venture unit repaid its LPs.&nbsp;","Yibo Ling, then chief business officer at Binance, said in April that the regulatory pressure faced by Binance in the United States \u201Cdoesn\u2019t really touch Labs in any way.\u201D Yet even in April there were signs that Binance Labs was doing less deals in the U.S. \u2014 and the pressure has been cranked up considerably since then.","Yesterday, Binance\u2019s co-founder and CEO Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/253681\/changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down-as-binance-ceo?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">agreed to step down as part of a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice<\/a>. He pleaded guilty to violating and causing a financial institution to violate the Bank Secrecy Act, agreed to a $50 million fine and may yet face prison time. Binance veteran Richard Teng was named as his successor. Binance itself will pay a mammoth $4.3 billion fine for violating money transmission laws and U.S. sanctions. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland slammed the company, stating that it \u201Cdid more than just fail to comply with federal law \u2014 it pretended to comply.\u201D","Binance Labs has been led by Yi He, a co-founder of Binance alongside Zhao, since August 2022. It has suffered a string of executive departures over the past few years, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/150022\/binance-labs-loses-top-two-executives-bill-chin-qian-nicole-zhang\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">including those of Bill Qian, its former head, and Nicole Zhang, an executive director.<\/a>","Ling \u2014 who, as recently as April had led M&amp;A and investments at Binance Labs in addition to his role as Binance\u2019s chief business officer \u2014 also left the business in recent months, according to his LinkedIn profile.","Â© 2023 The Block.
