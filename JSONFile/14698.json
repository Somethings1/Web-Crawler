He said he moved on from that particular mixer once he discovered other services \"suited his purposes better.\"","The U.S. Department of Justice's seizure of the billions in crypto in the Bitfinex case was unprecedented.","In the Bitcoin Fog case, U.S. authorities had arrested and charged Roman Sterlingov, a dual Russian-Swedish national, with money laundering in his operation of the mixing service in 2021.
