A total of 16 use cases submitted by industry participants were selected to take part in the pilot \u2014 which took place from March to July this year.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CUnlike earlier projects where the CBDC was purely a proof-of-concept, the pilot CBDC was issued as a real legal claim on the RBA,\u201D the report added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The study showed that a CBDC could potentially deliver benefits to Australian households and businesses. Many submissions highlighted the ability to directly control and program a tokenized CBDC as enabling a range of complex payment arrangements that are not supported by existing payment systems, the report said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The report also noted that there is significant interest from industry participants in exploring the tokenization of financial and other real assets on distributed ledger technology platforms, with CBDC used to settle related transactions. One key area of interest is traditional debt securities markets, where settlement times are typically measured in days, the report continued.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The RBA also warned in the report that some piloted use cases highlighted uncertainties over how CBDC and new business models making use of it would fit into current legal and regulatory frameworks.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CFor instance, the pilot CBDC was issued as a contractual liability of the RBA rather than under a legislative framework, as would likely be the case if a decision was ever made to issue a CBDC in the future,\u201D the report said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The RBA concluded that a CBDC has the potential to support increased efficiency and resilience in some areas of the payments system, \u201Cthough more research is required.\u201D<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
