Since launching in September 2018, the firm has hired employees from financial institutions like UBS, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Boerse.","According to Skew, in the third quarter of 2019, the firm saw 30% month-over-month user growth. \"Our user base is well spread across the three main regions, with Japan as [a] top country, U.S., and then [the] U.K.,\" Goh tells The Block.","Skew is entering a crowded market of cryptocurrency data providers.
