The crypto exchange recently secured licenses in France, Spain, Singapore, and Bermuda and has expanded access to its products to over 20 African nations. However, the California-based company has faced regulatory challenges at home, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233270\/sec-sues-coinbase-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suing<\/a> Coinbase last year, alleging it had violated securities laws.","In the UK, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234095\/a16z-uk-expansion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> in June he was keen on providing regulatory clarity regarding how crypto firms should register and operate in the country \u2014 as part of his ambitions for the UK to become a global hub for web3.
