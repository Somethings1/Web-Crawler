This belief is often called the \u201CWeb 3.0 Thesis\u201D, as proponents believe it is a consumer-friendly improvement on the current Web 2.0, which consists of mega-corporations like Google and Facebook making all the money off content that the rest of the world creates. In Web 3.0, the privacy and exploitation complaints that many have with large tech companies today are replaced by a decentralized network of transactions in which individuals are more appropriately compensated and their privacy wishes respected.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This is a very attractive-sounding, high-level argument, but as venture capitalists should know, the most common reason for startup failure is building something no one wants. And despite a tremendous amount of time, effort, and money having been thrown at the Web 3.0 Thesis, there is no real-world set of consumers who are actually using \u201CWeb 3.0.\u201D While proponents argue that it\u2019s just a matter of time, I think it useful to go back and ask how we got here -- how did we get to a point where billions of dollars have been spent on this thesis? Where did the thesis come from? Why do VCs believe it so deeply, despite having none of the usual adoption metrics that they usually require for investments of the size they\u2019re making?<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this article, I will walk through the Web 3.0 Thesis in a way that explains why venture capitalists believe, and why that faith is misplaced due to an insufficiently critical analysis of their own pattern-matching.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I think the clearest articulation of the Web 3.0 thesis comes from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TechCrunch\/status\/1039272689381199874\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ben Horowitz at TC Disrupt<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. It\u2019s a video well worth watching, but it needs to be distilled to something we can analyze, and so here is my breakdown out the core elements of the thesis:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The usual evidence cited for (1) and (2) is the internet and smartphones. Frequently <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Technological-Revolutions-Financial-Capital-Dynamics\/dp\/1843763311\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Carlota Perez\u2019s book on Technological Revolutions<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is referenced to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/avc.com\/2015\/02\/the-carlota-perez-framework\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">support the idea that things take time to mature and will have disappointments and hype cycles<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. It\u2019s certainly true that technology like the internet and smartphones have followed this type of path, and so if you believe that future innovations will match this pattern, then blockchain-based applications sure seem to look like they match.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Part (3) follows from this being about blockchain-based applications; it\u2019s really the main thing that an append-only, distributed ledger has that\u2019s new. By distributing a database to many locations that can\u2019t have any records erased, you don\u2019t have to trust anyone about what\u2019s in it. You (or a piece of software you have) can just check for yourself.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">They are logical problems in this thesis that do not appear part of any of the mainstream discourse on crypto, and so I am putting them down here to spur further conversation so that we might argue in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/arguo#Latin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">original sense of the word<\/span><\/a>&nbsp;<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">-- so that we might make things more clear.<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf A, then B\u201D does not imply \u201Cif B, then A\u201D.<\/span><\/i>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While I think that Chris Dixon\u2019s piece on <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/cdixon.org\/2013\/03\/03\/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">smart people and their weekends<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is excellent, I do not believe--nor do I think that a reading of history supports--a conclusion that literally everything done by enough \u201Csmart\u201D people on the weekends will be done by everyone else in the future.

I think this misunderstands trust in a very \u201Cengineer\u2019s-view-of-the-world\u201D way, and I find it disappointing that we have so much writing on Austrian Economics and TCP\/IP and blockchain, but none on the dynamics of trust.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Trust is \u201C<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trust_(emotion)\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a measure of belief in the honesty, fairness, or benevolence of another party<\/span><\/a>.<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201D Humans have created mechanisms within their own countries that enable trusting strangers, by trusting a nationally known intermediary that both parties trust. My experience as an American purchaser of goods with a credit card is that I will not have to pay for defective goods and that I will not have to pay for fraudulent transactions. My credit card company has made these promises to me, and they have followed through. When I conduct private-party financial transactions, I rely upon a functional legal system (e.g., small claims court) as a backstop. I recognize that my ability to have significant trust in these transactions is not free (but certainly not prohibitively expensive), from the fees that intermediaries in transactions take, to the taxes that pay for the legal system. But nevertheless I can transaction with people I would not ordinarily trust because I have other organizations and institutions that I can.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">And this is not just with payments. I also trust that if Equifax has poor information security, and if I am at risk of harm by that poor information security, they will pay to help protect me. And where that trust may be broken from time to time (e.g., Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, for some), I trust the social institutions that exist (e.g., federal, state, and local governments), that we as citizens have imbued with power, to help fix these problems with a variety of different tools that they have at their disposal.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Web 3.0 thesis views dApps as a way to replace these trusted intermediaries in all kinds of transactions -- not just financial --&nbsp; so that they are not necessary. (And, if dApps are cheaper that those intermediaries, goods should be cheaper). Also, perhaps more importantly, dApps would be able to be become trusted intermediaries for transactions that presently do not have any existing trusted intermediaries (e.g., in countries with unstable and\/or corrupt political situations).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It is important to call out that dApps -- or whatever the blockchain-based solution is -- are <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">intermediaries<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to these transactions. The idea that the mainstream public will participate in \u201Ctrustless\u201D transactions flies in the face of how trust works for the average person. People trust known entities, and if we reach any moment in which dApps are used by the general public to conduct transactions, the person using the dApp is going to place his or her trust in the dApp, not mathematical proofs. The provider of the dApp is going to be indistinguishable to the general public from the centralized service provider.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The average person is not going to draw a distinction between losing money from an online-wallet-service-provider like Mt. Gox and losing money due to a vulnerability from someone exploiting a vulnerability in the code of a dApp. In either case, they were wronged by a party that they\u2019re not going to trust in the future, and, further, they may not trust the entire category of similar parties (however they describe that category).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Keep in mind that this is not the narrative that is given in support of the Web 3.0 thesis.

A key aspect of being a human and interacting socially in the world, and building relationships with people, is that there is a crassness to reducing everything to enumeration. If you help me get my car out of a ditch, it\u2019s usually unwanted for me to try and pay you cash for helping me. As a species, we get more benefit out of helping each other and the more karmic relationships that creates than trying to keep everyone at a zero-balance relationship with each other.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The most challenging part in thinking critically about the Web 3.0 thesis is that there is so much <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_proof\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">social proof<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> from incredibly smart and respected and successful people who have bought into it religiously.

It is easy to understand where the belief comes from -- I\u2019ve laid it all out above -- but it is a belief, not a foregone conclusion, and we need more arguments around it to make things clearer.<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post was written by Joe E, a serial technical co-founder, with four successful exits.
