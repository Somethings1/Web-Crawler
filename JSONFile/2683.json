Popular platform MakerDAO, for instance, requires that borrowers deposit at least $150 ETH for every $100 in Dai they borrow.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Karen and Chad, on the other hand, would sign an actual legal agreement stipulating the terms of the loan, like interest rates and deadlines for repayments. That would be accomplished using a smart contract system developed by OpenLaw, a ConsenSys-backed firm that develops blockchain-based legal agreements.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Having a real, automatically generated contract in place \u201Cgives it the weight of the real world, not just the crypto world,\u201D OpenLaw cofounder Aaron Wright told The Block in an interview. If Chad doesn\u2019t honor the agreement, Karen can take him to court \u2014 as long as they are in the same jurisdiction.<\/span>","Wright said this approach could make the DeFi space more attractive to traditional players who deal with sums that call for legal guardrails. \"As we are thinking about these protocols and watching them scale and handle real money \u2014 not the comparatively small amounts that flow through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/81245\/watchmaker-breitling-digital-certificates-ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum<\/a> today but the larger amounts that we see financial institutions grapple with on a daily basis \u2014 those rights and obligations become more and more important.\""],"hashtag":["AAVE"]}
