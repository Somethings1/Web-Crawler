Gox has delayed the base, intermediate and early lump sum repayments deadline to creditors of the defunct bitcoin exchange and payouts can now be made up until Oct. 31, 2024, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mtgox.com\/img\/pdf\/20230921_announcement_en.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter<\/a> today from the Rehabilitation Trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi.","The deadline for creditors of Mt.

The Rehabilitation Trustee stated ample time was needed to verify this data, engage in discussions, and coordinate with banks, fund transfer service providers and designated crypto exchanges involved in the repayments.","\u201CTherefore, with the permission of the Tokyo District Court, the Rehabilitation Trustee has changed the deadline of the base repayment, the early lump-sum repayment, and the intermediate repayment from October 31, 2023 (Japan Time) to October 31, 2024 (Japan Time), respectively,\u201D the letter added.","Despite the overall delay, creditors who have already provided the necessary information to the Rehabilitation Trustee might see repayments as early as the end of this year, with repayments being made sequentially, the letter stated. However, the exact timing for each creditor remains undetermined, and the schedule still subject to change.","For creditors who haven't yet submitted the required information, the Rehabilitation Trustee urged them to do so. Without this data, the commencement of their repayments cannot begin.","Launched in 2010, the Tokyo-based platform exploded in popularity, going on to become the largest bitcoin exchange by 2013, servicing <a href=\"https:\/\/news.bitcoin.com\/bitcoin-history-part-6-the-first-bitcoin-exchange\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">70%<\/a> of all bitcoin trades worldwide.
