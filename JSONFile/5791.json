The fund suffered significant losses on its luna investment and the subsequent market downturn led to forced liquidations. Three Arrows Capital is unable to pay its debt, and as a result, several lenders are facing financial problems, including BlockFi and Voyager. Both recently received credit facilities from FTX's sister firm, Alameda Research.","According to Mohanty, the current market turmoil is a result of the world at large being lost in \"private currency.\"","He went on to suggest that the MAS will not easily grant licenses to crypto firms. The regulator has enforced a \u201Cpainfully slow\u201D and \u201Cextremely draconian due diligence process\u201D for licensing crypto firms, he said.","To date, the MAS has approved only 14 companies to offer crypto services. Earlier this week, the regulator <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/153488\/singapore-crypto-com-genesis-sparrow-approval\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">gave<\/a> in-principle approval to Crypto.com, Genesis and crypto trading platform Sparrow.","Overall, there has been a stark change in how Singapore views the crypto industry. The country previously openly courted the sector, but in recent months amid its harsher approach, crypto firms have moved to other countries, including Dubai.","Â© 2023 The Block.
