Paraguay, however, was left with excess power beyond its needs, and it sold the excess electricity to Brazil at a loss.","The rise of the bitcoin mining industry and the new facility will enable the country to transform the loss into a profitable venture, Sazmining said.","Sazmining is a fully non-custodial service, meaning customers' bitcoin rewards are sent directly from the mining pool to their private wallets, with the company only earning revenue when their clients do. Sazmining said this incentivizes all parties to optimize the efficiency of mining operations, as demonstrated by the cost-effectiveness of the eco-friendly Paraguay facility, alongside its on-site maintenance and dedicated security.","The Paraguay mining center will become Sazmining's second such venture, having previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/sazmining_launches_hydroelectric_renewable_energy_bitcoin_mining_facility_in_wisconsin\/prweb19113309.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> a hydro-powered facility in Wisconsin in January.","More than 50% of bitcoin mining now uses renewable energy, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/batcoinz.com\/bitcoin-by-energy-source\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a> from ESG analyst and co-founder of CH4 Capital Daniel Batton.
