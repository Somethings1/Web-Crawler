Modular networks are a new way of designing blockchains and are different from the older monolithic chains, where all network functions happen on the base layer. On modular blockchains, there are separate layers for network consensus, transaction execution and settlement, as well as data availability. This type of design is said to create networks that are more efficient and have greater scalability.","BitDAO\u2019s Layer 2 network stack has three distinct layers, according to the announcement. One layer is for transaction execution while the other two handle transaction finality and data availability, respectively.","Mantle is BitDAO\u2019s attempt to solve some of the challenges facing Layer 2 networks, a spokesperson for the DAO told The Block. \u201CBitDAO aims to bring the spotlight back from Alt-L1s to Ethereum and give market participants the best web3, DeFi and GameFi have to offer,\u201D said the spokesperson.","Mantle will reportedly offer superior features compared to other Layer 2 networks. BitDAO\u2019s Layer 2 network will come with faster throughput and low fees, and be powered by a decentralized data availability layer, the announcement stated. Transaction fees on Mantle will be paid using BitDAO\u2019s governance token, BIT.","EigenLayer, an Ethereum middleware platform, is one of the partners in the project. As such, early adopters can use EigenDA, a custom-built data availability layer designed by EigenLayer that supports Optimistic and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162098\/zk-rollups-likely-to-be-main-layer-2-solution-for-ethereum-says-vitalik-buterin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ZK-Rollups<\/a> \u2014 the two major types of roll-up technology.","Wednesday\u2019s announcement marks the soft launch of the Layer 2 network. Mantle is expected to roll out an incentivized public testnet next year.","A BitDAO spokesperson confirmed that DAO partners can deploy protocols on Mantle when launched. Unlike most DAOs built around specific DeFi projects, BitDAO is more of an investment DAO. BitDAO\u2019s mandate is to grow the web3 ecosystem by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162698\/bitdao-to-fund-africadao-with-20-million-for-web3-adoption-in-africa\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">providing grants to projects<\/a> and supporting web3-based research activities.
