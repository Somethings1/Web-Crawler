We have also initiated high-level discussions and remain open to engage prospective partners to explore advanced server placement mechanisms (i.e. submarine data centers).

As technology evolves, the underlying network of bitcoin can provide more than just computing services of \u201Casset transfer\u201D. Its gigantic scale of<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">computing power, robustness, and decentralized nature allow it to provide secure verification services for a wider range of applications. For example, there are many start-ups, working on establishing decentralized internet browsers, data storage applications on top<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> of the computing network.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In addition to supporting a wider range of applications, BTC mining, more importantly,<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shall be seen as a viable prototype of future distributed computing networks. For example<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">future applications of the Metaverse are unlikely to be built on current cloud computing networks - which are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and by their very centralized nature are controlled by a select group of companies. Distributed computing networks<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">are an extension of distributed ledger technology, which enables a multi-vs-multi<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">economic relationship. The security robustness and stability of the BTC network has been proven sound over the past few years. Atlas believes such a network is an important<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">building block of Web 3.0 and moreover will inspire more distributed computing networks to<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> be built.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BTC has often been criticized for consuming too much energy, but this assessment is<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">often misguided. When compared with traditional finance payment networks which are still operating on legacy infrastructure. We can see that traditional finance remains<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">insecure and extraordinarily inefficient. For instance, to process the same number of<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">transactions, the BTC network can retain more copies of transaction records, hold a longer transaction history, and complete the transactions in a fraction of the time, all the while<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> consuming less energy in the process.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BTC mining, as a dedicated computing application for fixed algorithms, has all participants committed to a common goal \u2013 to seek for extreme efficiency \u2013 due to its incentive mechanism and business model. The direct consequence of extreme efficiency has been to drive the development of chip technology. In fact, BTC mining has been the first large-<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">scale adopter of advanced semiconductor processors, whether form 16 nm to 7nm, 7nmto 5nm and possibly in the future to 3nm or even more advanced processes.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In addition to this, as BTC mining's computing is continuously running, it is not only in great demand for energy companies but is also able to use energy consistently. This means miners are valuable customers for energy companies. An interesting fact is that BTC mining, because of its flexibility, has the option to briefly turn off some of its servers during peak grid hours, thus releasing a large supply of electricity back to the grid. This enhances stability of the electricity system and increases BTC miners\u2019 profitability.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As visionary as these outlooks may appear, they are in fact very current in their potential.<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Atlas is working in-house and with external partners to better understand the values that we can provide the BTC network. 2022 will be the year that we tackle these purposes and<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> conviction to grow the market and our market share at the same time.&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About Atlas&nbsp;<\/strong>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Atlas is a Singapore headquartered technology group offering a broad range of value added services including high-performance computing, application specific computing, hosting and cloud services, hardware distribution, and associated consulting services.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The company\u2019s main revenue stream comes from maintaining and supplying computing capacity across blockchain networks.
