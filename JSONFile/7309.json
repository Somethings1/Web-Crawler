This means that firms can not only access crypto market data through Digital Assets Data's platform but also code various analytical tools on it.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, there are several other crypto data providers in the market, including Coinbase-backed Nomics and Coin Metrics, which <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/02\/27\/coin-metrics-raises-1-9m-to-bring-crypto-data-to-institutions\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">just raised<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> $1.9 million in February. Alfred says its product is differentiated from the competition because it is more like Bloomberg, the provider of terminals that line Wall Street trading floors combined with Github, a community of developers for sharing and building software. This means that instead of only receiving data feeds through APIs, developers can also build different analytical models on the company\u2019s platform, which allows firms to tailor it to their specific needs. <\/span>","\u201CWe are really providing a platform as opposed to a set of data,\u201D says Alfred. \u201CAPIs are valuable, but they are only valuable if you have the infrastructure to ingest that information and utilize it to your business. Today the vast majority of digital asset firms don\u2019t have high-quality data layout inside their organization, so using an API is not really that useful. What they need is a platform that can ingest all the data.\u201D","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, Digital Assets Data has around 22 engineers dedicated to building its data platform. With this fresh injection of capital, the company is looking into expanding its product offering. They are also in talks with several investors about a \u201Cmuch larger\u201D Series A \u201Cin the near future,\u201D according to Alfred. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CYou need $6 million to build the type of platform we are building and we are going to need tens of millions of dollars more in the short term to finish the vision,\u201D says Alfred. \u201C$6 million is significant, but given the market that we are trying to address, it\u2019s just the beginning.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alfred says that the vision of Digital Assets Data is to be \u201Cthe primary place\u201D where crypto businesses \u201Cexpress their investment thinking, and effectively run their businesses relevant to digital asset using our platform as the back end.\u201D<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclosure: Digital Assets Data is an investor in The Block.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
