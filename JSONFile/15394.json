Near\u2019s sharding approach \u201Cmitigates common scaling issues related to increasing centralization due to pooling and decreasing security due to poorly aligned incentives.\u201D","It's too early, however, to pick long-term winners and losers, according to the report.","\u201COver the longer term, we expect blockchains that prioritize usability and effectively market themselves to gain market share by attracting a robust and diverse ecosystem of applications that drives adoption, network effects and cash flows,\u201D analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.","Bank of America said that although Near does prioritize network usability while other blockchains focus on maximizing \"throughput,\" or speed, it needs to do more. Near development stagnated in 2022 compared with the year before despite its focus on usability, its innovative architecture and its ecosystem of more than a thousand applications, the bank noted.","Transactions fees have fallen since the first quarter of last year, and the rate of new users has dropped since the second quarter, which suggests that its \u201Capplications are no longer driving accelerating user growth,\u201D Bank of America said.","Much of the software powering third-generation blockchains such as Cardano, Solana, Polkadot, Tron, Avalanche and Near is \u201Cstill immature,\u201D and the development of these innovative technologies \u201Cremains in the first innings,\u201D the bank added.","\n","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tron","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alkesh Shah","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bank of America","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Polkadot","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Andrew Moss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"second quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u201D Bank of America","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"first quarter of last year","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Technology","Blockchain Development","Blockchains","Near","Bank of America"],"authors":["Will Canny"]}
