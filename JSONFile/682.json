To be clear, Harbone isn't suggesting that other exchanges will face scrutiny for the same reasons as Bitfinex inasmuch that other exchanges will be at the mercy of regulators' concerns as they hash out what is acceptable and what isn't \u2014 and who should have authority over the nascent market.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CPartly what is going on right now is the power play between various U.S. regulators over who has the real jurisdiction to go after [exchanges], particularly exchanges that don\u2019t even operate in the U.S., and the New York AG would like to say that it was them,\u201D said Harborne. \u201CThat\u2019s what makes it a very public statement and go for Bitfinex. I think others (law enforcement agencies) are also making a similar move under the scenes. That\u2019s understandable, but I don\u2019t think it is just going to be Bitfinex.\u201D&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitfinex and Ethfinex, which operate under the same leadership, rolled out their IEO platform Tokinex today amidst an ongoing battle with the New York Attorney General's office.
