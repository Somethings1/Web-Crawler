The survival-style game places new characters far away from other players with little access to items. As players continue to play, they encounter more players and items.&nbsp;","\u201CIn Web3 gaming, the game always needs to come first and the economic model has to support the game,\" said Jon Cohen, CTO &amp; co-founder of Bravo Ready, in a statement.","\"Providing tangible value for the time players spend in video games requires people to want to spend their time playing that game on a daily or weekly basis. Without a fun game that appeals to a wide audience, the most well thought out economic model will crumble under small demand.\"","The team is aiming to create more games while driving value for players in the ecosystem.","\"This isn\u2019t just a new game \u2013 it\u2019s a new way to game. It fundamentally reinvents the financial side of being a player,\" said Evan Ryer, CEO and co-founder of Bravo Ready. \"Our mission is to be at the crossroads of great games that people love and a business model that will drive value for all stakeholders, whether you are a gamer, audience member, content creator or game investor, the BR1 ecosystem is designed to drive incentive and reward all while creating a truly next level gaming experience.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
