The launch of the Supernets chain is set for next week.","The expansion to Polygon is planned in two stages, Palm Foundation said. During the initial phase, Palm Network aims to implement a proof-of-stake sidechain by Aug 1. Following this, the next phase will see the network migrate to a Layer 2 chain \u2014 also based on Supernets \u2014 that will utilize zero-knowledge rollups, slated for the subsequent year.","This strategic shift \u2014 done in collaboration with Polygon Labs \u2014 is rooted in the network\u2019s objective to tackle scalability issues and more effectively cater to its user demographic in the creators and gaming niches, the Palm Foundation said.","Supernets, previously Polygon Edge, is a Polygon platform that lets teams create their blockchain networks using a software development kit. Palm has joined other projects \u2014 like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221420\/polygon-to-help-develop-immutable-zkevm-secured-by-matic-stakers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Immutable<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221942\/gaming-project-aavegotchi-to-release-own-blockchain-with-polygon-supernets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aavegotchi<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238140\/idex-unveils-a-zkevm-layer-2-chain-based-on-polygon-supernets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IDEX<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014 working on Supernets for their blockchains in the Polygon ecosystem.&nbsp;","\u201CThe high speed, security, and scalability that Polygon Supernets provide are pivotal as we progress towards becoming a zkEVM multiprover,\u201D remarked Andrea Lerdo, executive director of the Palm Foundation.","The transition, the foundation said, is anticipated to boost interoperability with Ethereum and the broader Polygon 2.0, a planned ecosystem of multiple Layer 2 chains.","Palm Network has previously been used by entities like the Gary Vaynerchuk-backed Candy Digital and Ethereum developer <a href=\"https:\/\/consensys.net\/blog\/nft\/over-32000-users-from-130-countries-applied-to-purchase-damien-hirsts-nfts-on-the-palm-network\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Consensys<\/a> for issuing digital collectibles.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
