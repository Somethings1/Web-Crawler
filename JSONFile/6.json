It aims to find a location that meets its operational and regulatory requirements.","At Paris Blockchain Week, Teng <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/287168\/binance-ceo-says-exchange-is-weighing-up-a-few-jurisdictions-for-selecting-its-headquarters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">highlighted<\/a> the complexities of choosing a headquarters. He pointed out that the decision involves more than picking a country. It requires careful consideration of regulatory frameworks, tax implications, and strategic value for <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/binance-product-lead-down-exchange-executive-departures\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Binance\u2019s diverse product<\/a> lineup. ","\u201CThere\u2019s a lot of considerations behind it. So we are speaking to a few jurisdictions as of now; a few jurisdictions are under consideration,\u201D Teng said.","Thus, the choice of Binance headquarters signifies a major shift from the <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/binance-executive-speaks-lawsuits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">previous ambiguity<\/a> regarding a physical base.","Moreover, Teng\u2019s remarks during the event shed light on the difficulties of dealing with disparate regulatory regimes. He stressed that the lack of consistent global standards remains a daunting challenge for Binance and the entire crypto industry, necessitating a push for international regulatory coherence.","<strong>Read more: <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/crypto-regulation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?<\/a><\/strong>","\u201CSo that is one of the key challenges that the crypto industry will continue to face until we see harmonization of standards globally. And that harmonization is going to take a long time,\u201D Teng stated.","Previously, Binance navigated regulatory landscapes without committing to a specific headquarters, a stance often emphasized by former CEO Changpeng Zhao. However, under Teng\u2019s leadership, the narrative is changing towards establishing a tangible corporate presence. ","This shift is part of a broader strategy to align with global regulatory standards and enhance corporate governance.","In March, <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/binance-announces-board-of-directors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Binance took a significant step by forming a new board of directors<\/a>. This board combines internal and external expertise, with Gabriel Abed, former ambassador of Barbados to the United Arab Emirates, appointed chairman. ","This move came in the wake of <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/binance-pay-doj-fine-without-selling-crypto\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a hefty $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities<\/a> over anti-money laundering and sanctions violations, marking a crucial point in Binance\u2019s legal and regulatory journey.","Get guaranteed bonus up to $200 on Coinbase in 3 easy steps\n\n\t  ","<strong>Read more: <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/changpeng-zhao-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Who Is Changpeng Zhao?

Critics argue that the board is heavily skewed towards internal members, which may limit the exchange\u2019s capacity for independent oversight and dilute the infusion of regulated financial compliance expertise. ","\u201CBinance having a board composed primarily of company insiders tells me they are still resistant to outside control and oversight, and the lack of depth on the board of independent members with deep regulated financial risk or compliance experience is not ideal,\u201D&nbsp;Austin Campbell, a consultant for blockchain firms&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2024-04-01\/crypto-exchange-binance-names-its-first-board-of-directors?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said<\/a>.","Disclaimer","In adherence to the <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/trust-project\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/trust-project\/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-describedby=\"sk-tooltip-21920\">Trust Project<\/a> guidelines, BeInCrypto is committed to unbiased, transparent reporting.
