But what are the biggest compliance challenges crypto firms face, and what does a best practice AML program look like?&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">We explore these topics in detail in our new, in-depth research report, which can be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/complyadvantage.com\/insights\/crypto-aml-guide?utm_source=sponsored-post&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=the-block-crypto-report\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">downloaded for free here<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. Below is a summary of our 5 step AML program:&nbsp;<\/span><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The risk assessment is an opportunity to identify the AML\/CFT risks a crypto firm faces and design a plan that mitigates them. While the overarching considerations are similar to other financial institutions, there are nuances. These include:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In addition, firms must keep in mind that the risk assessment isn\u2019t a one-and-done requirement, but rather should be viewed as a living document. Crypto firms should revisit the risk assessment regularly: at minimum, they should conduct a review annually.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2. Understand Key Typologies<\/strong><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Money mules, fraudulent accounts, identity theft and account takeover fraud, among others, are concerns shared by all financial institutions. Typologies may also vary in individual markets \u2014 some firms told us they will leverage FATF typologies where they\u2019re entering new markets and don\u2019t have historic customer data to work from. Overall, however, the firms we interviewed highlighted a number of typologies including layering, dusting, money mules, the laundering of NFTs, and payment for goods or services on darknet markets using cryptoassets.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">3. Hire the Right Personnel<\/strong><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Several of the crypto firms we interviewed mentioned their inclination to look to other firms in the sector for talent. After all, there is value in a deep understanding of the crypto space when evaluating the risk landscape and how to best adapt systems and processes to flag suspicious customers and transactions. However, many other firms we interviewed stressed that this may not always be the best approach. The dynamics and intricacies of cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets, while complicated, can be taught.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Instead, those in the crypto space would do well to expand their talent pool and look for candidates with transferable or complementary skills and knowledge. A well-rounded team may include individuals with backgrounds in areas such as traditional finance, policy making\/regulatory bodies and law enforcement.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For most firms, the time, energy and resources spent building AML\/CFT compliance solutions would have been better spent elsewhere. After some trial and error, many firms choose to look externally for compliance tools, concluding that there are existing solutions that serve their needs or that can do so with a bit of tweaking.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, crypto firms should look for solutions that help automate these compliance processes, including:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">5.&nbsp; Manage Internal and External Stakeholders<\/strong><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It may be tempting to lean into the argument that not taking action on compliance will lead to negative consequences, including reputational damage and revocation of licenses. But that line of reasoning will only take compliance officers so far \u2014 and won\u2019t enable productive conversations or foster a culture of compliance. Instead, education is crucial. The board and the executive team should come away from conversations about compliance with an understanding of not just what the regulations are but how working within them can benefit the company\u2019s bottom line.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A firm\u2019s first contact with a regulator is typically regarding licensing requirements, and that can set the tone for the firm\u2019s relationship with the regulator moving forward. To ensure the firm understands expectations around licensing and its compliance obligations, it should review consultations and guidance by local regulators and lawmakers. Above all, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">consistent, constructive communication with regulators is vital and mutually beneficial.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To read our recommendations in full, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/complyadvantage.com\/insights\/crypto-aml-guide?utm_source=sponsored-post&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=the-block-crypto-report\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">download the full Guide to AML for Crypto Firms<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by ComplyAdvantage <\/i><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
