Plus, tokens issued on Multichain make up 78% of the market cap of tokens on Fantom.<\/span>","Yet Cronje said he wasn't particularly concerned about this because the assets are secured by the multi-party computation protocol and the Fantom bridge is unaffected.","\"If something did happen, it would impact multichain-issued USDC, DAI, and wBTC.
