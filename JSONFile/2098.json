There are very few that actually fully operate under the US regulatory bodies. Notably, INX is a pioneer in working with checks and balances. Back when other players enjoyed the big numbers coming in, INX worked tirelessly and had to spend millions before onboarding the first client. In the midst of the pandemic, it invested in its future rather than being tempted to start operating and getting income immediately, it invested millions in order to get a prospectus from the SEC and a broker-dealer license and therefore positioned the company to become a fully regulated entity under the US regulators whereby it could operate in a safe and secure environment for the long term - protecting both the clients and the company.<\/span>","","","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">INX holds an audited and segregated reserve fund, does not use customer assets, and does not, in any way, shape, or form, leverage or re-invest a customer\u2019s assets. These were all put in place to make sure customers are safe, and a future that opens a wealth of opportunities to all can be secured. What we\u2019ve seen lately in other companies would likely have never occurred in this regulated environment.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As history has taught us after greed has caused mayhem and anarchy, order will be restored as rules, regulations, boundaries, and enforcement procedures are put in place and ultimately become the order of the day.
