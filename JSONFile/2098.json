It draws inspiration from its Plaid Link product, which allows users to connect their financial accounts across different fintech applications. In an effort to preserve privacy, Allsopp says that the product doesn't collect wallet addresses.&nbsp;","It's being used by developers at web3 wallet and DeFi company Zerion. The company integrated the wallet onboard product to ease the user experience of tracking holdings across many different wallets. Other companies in the NFT, lending and web3 data space are also using or showing interest in the product, claimed Allsopp.&nbsp;\"We're seeing a large trend of diversity in the different products that people want to use this for just because every crypto app needs to connect a wallet,\" he said.","Plaid is also eying further products in the web3 space while looking to replicate the products it already has, such as identity verification, on crypto rails.&nbsp;","\"So how do we do privacy-preserving identity verification for developer and user while not revealing actual personally identifiable information,\" Allsopp asked. \"So maybe fragments of information such as this address lives in a certain area or this address is over a certain age.\"","Currently, the Wallet Onboard product is only integrated with Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains, but the company is exploring integration with Solana and other blockchains.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["FINTECH","WALLETS"]}
