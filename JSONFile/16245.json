The funds will go toward building out an accelerator that aims to foster the growth of teams working to launch Web3 projects. The raise was Delphi\u2019s first time courting outside investments.","\u201COver our ~6 years in crypto, we\u2019ve consulted for, invested in, and helped build several multi-billion dollar protocols across every vertical in crypto. We know first-hand how hard it is to build a crypto startup and we\u2019ve experienced all the common pitfalls,\u201D wrote the Delphi team in a draft announcement post shared with CoinDesk.","Each team in the accelerator will receive $200,000 in funding. The main part of the program will last from four to six months, and project teams will be introduced to Delphi\u2019s network of potential investors at the end of the program. Participants will receive hands-on advice from a core team of engineers, economists, designers, lawyers and entrepreneurs on everything from product development, legal advice and go-to-market strategies.","Delphi Labs said that the plan is to scale up to 10 teams per year. Each cohort of the accelerator will be focused on a particular Web3 ecosystem to allow for a more targeted approach to support. The first cohort will focus on the Cosmos ecosystem; applications are now open.","\u201CDelphi has an exceptional team with extensive experience and a deep understanding of all aspects of managing a Web3 project. Their expertise ranges from intricate legal structures to tokenomics design and development, as well as building truly decentralized protocols and selecting the ideal technology stack,\u201D said P2P founder Konstantin Lomashuk. \u201CIf I were to enter this field and launch a new venture, I would undoubtedly do so through the innovative Delphi Accelerator.\u201D","Read more: Jump Crypto Wants You to Know Its Name","Edited by Christie Harkin."],"entity":[{"type":"Delphi Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$13.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Lido","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Jump Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$200,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Delphi","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Delphi Accelerator","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Delphi Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Konstantin Lomashuk","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Christie Harkin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Exclusive","Delphi Digital","Web3","Accelerators","Jump Crypto","Funding"],"authors":["Brandy Betz"]}
