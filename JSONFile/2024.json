In fact, Bittrex is exploring the potential of STO-based tokens, such as in real estate as well as possibly art and IPOs, as Stonberg suggested. \u201CI really think that you're going to see everything being tokenized. Why should we not have real estate tokenized? Like, why should if you're IPOing a company, why does it have to be an IPO? Why can't it be in the venture stage?\u201D <\/span>","As for where competitors are in the adoption cycle, Stonberg added: \"Right now, we're in the fund build phase where the regulators haven't caught on yet.\" However, he did not comment on whether Bittrex has plans at this time to fundraise or enter public markets.","© 2023 The Block.
