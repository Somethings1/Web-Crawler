It's up 16% in the last 24 hours and has reached a market cap of $84.7 billion. The market cap has risen higher than the peak market cap seen in November 2021 and is setting new all-time highs. While solana has a lower price than at its previous peak, the supply has increased considerably, resulting in a higher market cap.","While the crypto markets have rallied hard over the last few months, many top cryptocurrencies have experienced a pullback over the last few days. For instance, bitcoin has dropped back from $73,000 to $69,000 and ether has fallen back below the $4,000 mark. However, solana's price has bucked this latest trend.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Solana's price has kept rallying.

It's up from just $9 in October 2023.","As a result of mixed performance among Layer 1 blockchain tokens, they have remained flat overall. The GML1 Index, which tracks the performance of native tokens for Layer 1 blockchains, has stayed level for four days \u2014 showing the positive and negative price changes counteracting each other.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/crypto-indices\/gmci-l1-index\/embed\" title=\"GMCI L1 Index: Layer 1 tokens\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Tokens associated with Layer 2 networks have not performed as well.
