Before that, Schmiedt managed business development at the now-Coinbase owned blockchain infrastructure provider, Bison Trails. In addition, at ConsenSys, Schmiedt supported the development of the blockchain and web3 commerce finance suite, Codefi.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think that is one of the biggest hurdles that I see today for the adoption of staking more broadly,\u201D said Schmiedt. She pointed out that capital efficiency and liquidity are important to well-functioning capital markets. \u201CToday protocols are not trying to optimize for that\u201D she added, and explained that optimization instead remains focused on security standards and the measures used to enforce them.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At Alluvial, Schmiedt is tasked with advancing the company's recently launched <a href=\"https:\/\/alluvial.finance\/liquid-collective-kraken\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Liquid Collective<\/a> protocol. Designed to be a multi-chain protocol, she called the new framework a blanket architecture to enable major integrators, custodians, exchanges, and other financial institutions to optimize for the right liquidity, volume, and utilization. The company draws inspiration from the participatory approach companies such as Visa engaged in to build today\u2019s widely utilized payment processing standards, she added.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Liquid Collective was launched as the collaborative effort of teams from industry-leading organizations, notably Coinbase, Kraken, Figment, and other web3 providers, Schmiedt said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe want to build something that allows our integrators to build the most user-friendly access and experience so that we can support a very broad range of end users,\u201D she said. \u201CA KYC, AML-enabled protocol that effectively creates the right compliance checks at the point of deposit and withdrawal.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although staking services may be appealing to what she characterized as a broadening base of participants, Schmiedt acknowledged a trend towards more centralization in terms of validation power among major blockchain networks. However, Liquid Collective's industry-specific enterprise grade framework will play an important role in decentralizing the general participation of network validation support by bringing in new adopters, she said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Staking rewards are down by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174481\/ethereum-mining-staking-revenues-down-more-than-50-in-september\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">roughly 51.7%<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> on a month-over-month basis, The Block Research shows. Schmiedt emphasized the importance of noting \u201Creward rates are effectively always endogenous to the systems that they're part of. Reward rates are optimizing for security, so lower staking rates mean higher reward rates because protocols incentivize participants to come into the network to hit a certain security budget to secure the network.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Conversely, she said, once a certain threshold of participation is reached, an adequate security budget justifies lowering reward rates. In the long term, these factors, as well as general adoption, price, volatility, and considerations around liquidity will ultimately drive the equilibrium of where the pendulum swings on network rewards, Schmiedt said.<\/span>"],"hashtag":["STAKING"]}
