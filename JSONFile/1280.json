The next halving event, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/280125\/bitcoin-halving-50-days\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">expected<\/a> on April 20, will see the reward subsidy for miners on the network drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. However, they continue to earn additional transaction fees for each block mined.","U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds remain a significant factor in the market. Grayscale\u2019s converted GBTC fund witnessed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/283323\/grayscale-gbtc-spot-bitcoin-etf-record-outflow\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">record daily outflows<\/a> of $642.5 million on Monday, leading to a total net outflow of $154.4 million yesterday for the first time since March 1.","\u201CETF flows are reflexive \u2014 higher on the way up and slower with weaker price action,\u201D the Bernstein analysts noted. However, as bitcoin\u2019s price action has historically consolidated ahead of the halving, and considering the rally it experienced both in the run-up to spot bitcoin ETF approvals and following substantial net inflows since their launch on Jan. 11, the recent price action is not surprising. \u201CThe correction seems healthy and does not affect our cross-cycle view, i.e that bitcoin is headed to $150,000 as the cycle high by 2025,\u201D Chhugani and Sapra wrote.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin price action around halvings.

The cryptocurrency is down 7% over the past 24 hours and 12% over the past week. However, it remains up around 50% year-to-date.&nbsp;","Last week, Bernstein argued that public miner stocks remain the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281692\/miners-best-equity-proxy-bitcoin-150000-usd-bernstein\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">best equity proxy<\/a> to bitcoin as its price heads toward their 2024-2025 cycle target \u2014 especially given a recent period of underperformance.","The analysts said they were particularly focused on Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, suggesting that at current bitcoin price levels and above \u2014 even if their production costs were to double after the halving \u2014 the miners would generate around 70% and 60% gross profit margins, respectively.","Later in the week, Chhugani and Sapra predicted the overall crypto market cap could surge threefold to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/282472\/crypto-market-cap-7-5-trillion-usd-2025-bernstein\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$7.5 trillion<\/a> by the end of 2025, led by the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems amid \u201Cunprecedented\u201D institutional adoption.","\u201CWe expect total crypto market cap to reach $7.5 trillion by 2025 vs. $2.6 trillion today, led by Bitcoin ($3 trillion by 2025), Ethereum ecosystem ($1.8 trillion by 2025) and leading blockchains e.g. Solana, Avax, etc. ($1.4 trillion by 2025),\u201D the analysts said at the time.
