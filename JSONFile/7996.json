It used the 2022 implosion of the FTX crypto exchange as an example.&nbsp;","\"The sector operates under the banner of decentralization, but in practice new centralized intermediaries have played a key role in channeling funds into the crypto universe and intermediating within it,\" the bank said.&nbsp;","It said that innovations the industry has developed such as programmability, composability and the automation of financial transactions can be replicated or embedded in the \"safer and more trusted traditional finance system.\"","The BIS criticized the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238965\/former-security-engineer-arrested-in-ny-after-allegedly-defrauding-a-defi-exchange-stealing-9-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">decentralized finance<\/a> sector, calling it \"self-referential\" and claiming it copied services offered by the traditional financial system.

It added this could result in the growth of crypto itself \"as new money gets channeled into such tokenized assets.\"","The systemic importance of the crypto ecosystem could increase substantially with the expansion of tokenization of real world assets, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235800\/bis-makes-case-for-unified-ledger-but-describes-crypto-as-a-flawed-system\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BIS<\/a> added.
