And the pitch is simple, users will be able to earn something called the&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/vicetoken.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/vicetoken.com\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vice Industry Token<\/a>, shortened as VIT, by streaming and \u201Cinteracting with\u201D videos (this means apparently posting comments, clicking \u201Clike\u201D buttons, et al. so keep your mind out of the gutter).","By now you\u2019re very likely asking: Why do people need to get paid to watch porn? And they almost certainly don\u2019t. Pornhub, which is the industry leader and owns many of the most popular sites, got 28.5 billion visits last year alone\u200A\u2014\u200Aabout a thousand every second. It served 92&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">billion<\/em>&nbsp;videos representing apparently 4.6 billion hours of porn viewing in 2017. (These stats were grabbed&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/fightthenewdrug.org\/by-the-numbers-see-how-many-people-are-watching-porn-today\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/fightthenewdrug.org\/by-the-numbers-see-how-many-people-are-watching-porn-today\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">here<\/em><\/a>.)","The vast majority of that content was consumed for free.","And yet there\u2019s an interesting story here about the idea of trying to crack one of the internet\u2019s greatest puzzles by using tokens. It dates back more than 50 years.","You may not have heard of&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ted_Nelson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ted_Nelson\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ted Nelson<\/a>&nbsp;but there\u2019s a near certainty you\u2019ve been impacted by his vision. Decades before the dawn of the web, Nelson, then a student at Harvard, conceived of a \u201Cdigital repository scheme for world-wide electronic publishing.\u201D Within a few years, the idea had rattled around in Nelson\u2019s brain long enough that he imagined a way to navigate that repository by having special functionality attached to certain words or phrases on a computer screen. Interacting with those words would instantly surface other information.","If this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Nelson was describing&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hypertext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hypertext\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hypertext<\/a>, or what we eventually came to know as \u201Chyperlinks\u201D and now just typically shortened to&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">links<\/em>. While his project never made the impact of Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s World Wide Web, it most certainly played an influential role. (The h in http, of course, stands for hypertext).","But Nelson\u2019s vision wasn\u2019t merely around linking information. He foresaw the need to pay content creators for their work. Nelson coined the term \u201Cmicropayments\u201D to describe small amounts of money, easily transmitted, to allow those that read\/listen\/view content to compensate those that wrote\/recorded\/filmed it.","Nelson saw micropayments as core to his&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Project_Xanadu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Project_Xanadu\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Xanadu<\/a>, the grand name for his grand project for a \u201Cdigital repository\u2026 for publishing\u201D. But while the web delivered much of his vision, micropayments have remained something of a Gordian knot online: There must be a way to solve the problem, but thus far&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Micropayment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Micropayment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">we only have the wreckage of those who have tried and failed<\/a>.","Which brings us back to Tube8 and the VIT. It\u2019s not the first time cryptocurrency has been associated with pornography nor even the first we have heard of Pornhub getting interested in tokens. Back in April, the site announced it would begin accepting payments via the anonymous cryptocurrency Verge (VXG). The use case there was to pay for premium subscriptions using a method that&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/10\/24\/opinion\/24dowd.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/10\/24\/opinion\/24dowd.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wouldn\u2019t leave a trace<\/a>. You can actually&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pornhub.com\/crypto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.pornhub.com\/crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">use Verge today to sign up<\/a>&nbsp;(the link is safe for work).","The process remains&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/vergecurrency.com\/get-started\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/vergecurrency.com\/get-started\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">convoluted<\/a>, of course, as with much around crypto. Verge recommends buying bitcoin or Ethereum at Coinbase and then using that crypto to acquire VXG through Binance. At that point you can download your Verge wallet, load the VXG into it, and spend it\u200A\u2014\u200Aat least at Pornhub. It\u2019s exhausting just to think about.","The new VIT\/Tube8 deal works in reverse. Instead of taking all sorts of steps to buy a product you can already buy with a credit card, the idea here is to seed VIT into the word by giving it to people who would do something anyway, i.e. watch free porn.","Of course if it works, there could be millions of VIT users. And from there the vice token could&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">also<\/em>&nbsp;be used as a payment mechanism, perhaps even encouraging holders of it to acquire more in exchange for other cryptos they already have or can easily get.","In the future, the VIT given away by Tube8 could allow purchasing content across the Pornub family. But more interestingly, it could go much farther than that.","If you hadn\u2019t heard of Ted Nelson, there\u2019s a good chance that Harrison Marks is also an unfamiliar name. His rather colorful history dates back to 1950s London where, in his photo studio in Soho, Marks began taking \u201Cglamour\u201D photographs of women. The euphemism referred to mid-century erotica and after publishing some of that work in a magazine he and partner Pamela Green called&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kamera<\/em>, Marks sets his sights on the technological revolution of his day.","The advent of 8 millimeter film made it possible to shoot movies without rather large, typically expensive professional equipment. Using 8mm equipment, Marks made \u201C<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/people\/obituary-harrison-marks-1249894.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/people\/obituary-harrison-marks-1249894.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">glamour home movies<\/a>\u201D with topless women. They were often filmed in his and Green\u2019s kitchen (she was also one of the women on film) and were sold using the most high-tech methods of the day, including retail stores and&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mail order.&nbsp;<\/em>Without Facebook ads and a website to promote them, Marks and Green often used the pages of their own&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kamera&nbsp;<\/em>magazine to do so.","But while their work would eventually make the move to 35mm, their pioneering use of 8mm helped boost that format and ushered in an era where porn would often lead the way in making \u201Cthe next big thing\u201D happen.","By the 1970s, adult firlms had made their way to movie theaters in what were often the least desirable neighborhoods of America\u2019s cities. But then a revolution would happen that would forever move adult entertainment into people\u2019s homes. The VCR was born and while it often cost more than one thousand 1970s dollars (almost $5,000 today) access to recent Hollywood movies, the ability to record TV and watch it later, and access to&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">porn<\/em>&nbsp;made it a smash hit.","By the decade\u2019s end half of the videos sold were adult content and the porn industry\u2019s selection of the VHS format for distribution helped kill Sony\u2019s technologically superior Betamax.","By the time the internet had begun to go mainstream in the mid 1990s, porn was already one of the most popular forms of content online. \u201CMarketing Pornography on the Information Superhighway: A Survey of 917,410 Images, Description, Short Stories and Animations Downloaded 8.5 Million Times by Consumers in Over 2000 Cities in Forty Countries, Provinces and Territories\u201D was published in the&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Georgetown Law Journal<\/em>. That same year, Gary Kremen, an entreprenuer behind the dating side match.com registered the domain name sex.com. Back then it was common for people to search for something by typing in a basic keyword, and people were clearly going to search for sex.","A gentleman named Stephen Cohen figured the same thing and fraudulently got Network Solutions to transfer the domain from Kremen to him and allegedly made between $50,000 and $500,000 per month just directing clicks from the sex.com homepage out to other porn sites. Kremen sued and in 2001 was awarded $67 million for lost income associated with that site.","At that point, there were an estimated 21,000 websites devoted to porn. Today, it\u2019s estimated there are 4.2&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">million<\/em>. While much of the revenue for online porn comes from advertisements run along with the adult content, there\u2019s a huge business in charging people money to view it as well. And for that, we can thank the third obscure historical figure in our story: Richard J. Gordon. When&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/culture\/culture-news\/pam-and-tommy-the-untold-story-of-the-worlds-most-infamous-sex-tape-194776\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/culture\/culture-news\/pam-and-tommy-the-untold-story-of-the-worlds-most-infamous-sex-tape-194776\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee taped themselves engaged in sexual relations<\/a>&nbsp;back in 1995, they had no idea that Gordon would later be the man who would figure out how to charge people to watch them.","But that he did, and Gordon\u2019s Electronic Card System led the way: \u201CHe was the house for Internet porn in the early days,\u201D said an early employee. \u201CAt that time, if you had anything to do with Internet porn, you called Electronic Card Systems.\u201D","Credit card companies don\u2019t love dealing with porn sites, however, which meant businesses like Gordon\u2019s had to act as middleman, charging hefty fees to deal with fraud losses, chargebacks, and the like.&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"56f89f949263\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Today, one of the successors to Electronic Card Systems,&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ccbill.com\/online-merchants\/business-solutions-for\/highrisk.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.ccbill.com\/online-merchants\/business-solutions-for\/highrisk.php\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ccBill<\/a>, charges&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as low as&nbsp;<\/em>10.8% to work with \u201Chigh risk\u201D merchants like porn sites.<\/span>","Which brings us back to Vice Industry Token, Verge tokens, and something that goes by the perhaps too on-the-nose name of Spankchain. With so many porn sites vying for a (somewhat) finite amount of human attention, it ain\u2019t easy to make a living out there.","The economics of porn are worthy of their own lengthy discussion, but consider some basics. Among the most popular places to view adult content are \u201Ccam sites\u201D where models\u200A\u2014\u200Amostly women\u200A\u2014\u200Aperform live for an audience watching their video stream. The basic business model is akin to Dropbox\u2019s \u201Cfreemium\u201D style: You can join and watch for free, but if you want more, you\u2019ve got to pay.","<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"56f89f949263\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To do this, the viewer buys \u201Ctokens\u201D (no relation to crypto tokens) that are the specific site\u2019s currency. The site operator first has to pay someone like ccBill 10% or more of the total value of tokens purchased. Then they have to pay to host all the models in terms of bandwidth and other server expenses. Oh and they want to make a profit too. This leaves the models earning less than half of what their benefactors choose to contribute, whether for that special attention or just digital tips. Think of tipping in tokens as the modern equivalent of dollar bills at what amounts to the 21st century answer to \u201Cstrip clubs.\u201D<\/span>","Spankchain wants to fix that via the blockchain and a smart contract built on Ethereum. Using their Vynos wallet, Spankchain hopes to make it possible to pay for content using micropayments that are both anonymous (shades of what Verge is aiming for) and also low cost for all involved. Ideally, sites could batch a bundle of small transactions to keep fees super low. But even without that, not having the double-digit hit of the credit card middleman is a step forward. Similarly, the loss of protections associated with credit cards, most notably the consumer\u2019s ability to ask for a chargeback for nearly any reason, becomes a feature here and not a bug: Once you pay to view, you\u2019ve committed whether or not the scenery was as expected.","We\u2019ve looked at three initiatives already all basically focused on the same goal: making micropayments work online after all. If any succeeds, they could realize Nelson\u2019s vision from the 1960s. They\u2019d also keep Berners-Lee\u2019s revolution alive against threats of the centralization of content as&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/news\/facebook-google-digital-ad-market-share-drops-amazon-climbs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/news\/facebook-google-digital-ad-market-share-drops-amazon-climbs\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook and Google continue to grab a bigger share of advertising revenue<\/a>&nbsp;while nearly all other publishers struggle.","But for this time to be different, someone will have to rise above the noise of the countless crypto projects out there and become something of a standard. The failure of countless initiatives in the past likely explains why Pornhub has chosen to dabble with two crypto players at different ends of the value chain.","That decision limits business risk but doesn\u2019t solve the greater problem. For a truly decentralized, low cost solution, consumers need to be able to take one wallet and ideally one token across all sorts of sites.","It\u2019s a chicken-and egg problem that defies easy solution as even Apple, Amazon, and Google struggle to get websites and apps to accept their payment schemes. One clever solution has been the model adopted by&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Patreon<\/a>, which turns micropayments into micro-<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">subscriptions.&nbsp;<\/em>Patreon allows creators to bill their fans monthly for access to any content they create, no matter whether it\u2019s writing, video, images.","By centralizing the signup mechanism, a user only has to enter credit-card info once and by centralizing billing, Patreon can keep fees low-ish at a 5% rake. Of course, this isn\u2019t anonymous and it\u2019s fundamentally centralized so automatically anathema to much of the crypto\/blockchain ethos. But it shows early signs of being effective and that has made it a go-to choice for content creators.","For a crypto solution to compete it will need to even cheaper and solve the problems Patreon still doesn\u2019t handle. Selling single articles or videos, even a view thereof, has been the goal of micropayments since the 1990s. But most publishers have adopted their own subscription platforms that create binary choices like \u201Chere\u2019s a month free, but then pay us $10 a month for as long as you want our stuff\u201D. This kind of model is common with newspaper sites in particular though it often starts at 99 cents.","Underlying those teaser offers is often a limited amount of free articles, typically 5\u201310 per month, before you must subscribe. But the gap between free and $10 on a recurring billing is intimidating to users. If there was a common cryptocurrency well tuned for micropayments, the&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Los Angeles Times&nbsp;<\/em>could consider offering say three free articles, perhaps the next few at 25 cents each, and then\u200A\u2014\u200Ausing the same token that buys the a la carte posts\u200A\u2014\u200Amight offer to upgrade more frequent users to an all-you-can-eat model.","If every time someone wanted to patronize a publisher they needed a new token or wallet, they\u2019d likely just give up\u200A\u2014\u200Afriction is too high. Price is also a potential problem: If every time you wanted to stream from a porn site you had to pay a significant fee, you might seek out something free instead.","That leaves tokens not only competing with one another, but also swimming upstream against the same forces publishers have been fighting since the middle 1990s. As Steve Wozniak said in the 1984 \u201C<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/digitopoly.org\/2015\/10\/25\/information-wants-to-be-free-the-history-of-that-quote\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/digitopoly.org\/2015\/10\/25\/information-wants-to-be-free-the-history-of-that-quote\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">information wants to be free<\/a>&nbsp;because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time\u201D but what is less remembered is that he was responding to his own opposite notion:","<em class=\"markup--em markup--pullquote-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Information wants to be expensive, because it\u2019s so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your&nbsp;life<\/em>","That\u2019s almost certainly not true of a given moment of X-rated entertainment.; But&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"56f89f949263\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the idea of information as valuable drives creators of all types and explains our seemingly endless appetite for content prurient and practical.
