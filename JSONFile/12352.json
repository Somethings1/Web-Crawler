It's run by AAVE token holders. The DeFi lending platform launched its third version in March, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/138018\/aave-set-to-launch-third-version-of-its-defi-protocol-across-six-networks\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as previously reported by The Block<\/a>.","According to Wednesday\u2019s proposal, the $16.6 million retroactive funding will cover two payments. One part worth $15 million is for incurred work on the part of the team, while the remaining $1.6 million will be to cover smart contract auditing costs. The proposal stated that five different security firms audited the Aave v3 code in two separate auditing rounds.","The Aave developer also wants the $16.6 million payment split between $10 million in stablecoins and $6.6 million in AAVE (the protocol\u2019s native token). The proposal requested that the $10 million payment in stablecoins should mirror the percentage composition of the protocol's treasury stablecoin holdings. The DAO's treasury holds about $34 million in three stablecoins \u2014 USDC, DAI and USDT \u2014 with USDC at 51% of the holdings and the latter two at 30% and 19% respectively.","The company says it will lock its $6.6 million in AAVE coins upon approval of the proposal. The vesting period will last for one year and the tokens will be staked during the lock-up period. The proposal also suggested a suitable price benchmark to determine how many tokens should be worth $6.6 million when making the payment. This benchmark price is a retrospective two-week average from the moment the governance vote passes.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
