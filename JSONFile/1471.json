A new research study based on interviews with 1,800 Salvadoran households suggests that the number is not very high.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CLeveraging this data, we document how, despite the government\u2019s 'big push' and a large fraction of people downloading Chivo Wallet, usage of bitcoin for everyday transactions is low and is concentrated among the banked, educated, young, and male population,\u201D says a US National Bureau of Economic Research <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w29968\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">working paper<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> released in April.&nbsp;<\/span>","In September, El Salvador launched Chivo, offering a giveaway of $30 in bitcoin for each person who signed up. The wallet <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">supports both bitcoin and the country\u2019s existing legal currency, U.S. dollars. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe main driver of adoption is reported to be the $30 bonus offered by the government,\u201D the authors of the new report found.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the study also found that many Salvadorans stopped using Chivo after they had used the free bonus. Only about 20% of the survey respondents had kept using Chivo after spending their bonus.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Survey respondents said that 40% of their app downloads took place when Chivo launched last September, and \u201Cvirtually no downloads\u201D have taken place this year, the authors wrote.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The new study also found that bitcoin has seen slow adoption by merchants. Companies in El Salvador are required by law to accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment \u2014 as long as they have the technical ability to do so. However, the study's findings suggest this rule has not been very strictly enforced. According to a subset of the respondents who owned businesses or could answer questions about their employers\u2019 payment methods, only 20% reported accepting bitcoin. The majority of firms \u2014 88% \u2014 said they convert it into dollars instead of keeping a bitcoin balance in the app.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chivo has had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/131452\/el-salvadors-chivo-wallet-keeps-breaking-and-users-are-seeking-answers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a litany of technical issues<\/a> since its launch. However, technical problems were only number six on a list of reasons why people who knew about Chivo didn\u2019t download it (over 21% of survey respondents). The main reason was a preference for using cash. Some respondents said they didn't trust the Chivo system and bitcoin, and others said they did not have a phone capable of using the app.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Out of the respondents in the survey, 64.6% had access to a smartphone. More than half used solely cash to pay for things before Chivo, 70% did not have a bank account and 90% were not using mobile banking services.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The Salvadorean experience allows us to document that requiring all businesses to accept bitcoin, providing large incentives to increase its adoption, and accepting it as a means to pay for taxes might not be enough to move to an equilibrium where bitcoin is used as medium of exchange,\u201D the study found.&nbsp;<\/span>"],"hashtag":["BITCOIN"]}
