It supports bitcoin, ether, BNB, dogecoin and other coins. The protocol currently holds approximately $361 million in Total Value Locked (TVL).","Cross-chain swaps let you swap a token from one blockchain to a different token on another blockchain. They either happen through one single protocol or take use of multiple protocols (combinations of decentralized exchanges and bridging protocols).","In this case, Thorswap uses Thorchain, which is a single protocol for cross-chain swaps. This is what enables users to make cross-chain swaps without using non-native assets.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
