Offering a collateral asset allows the lender to offer a better rate, as it can be sold in case of default. In most cases, the value of the asset must greatly surpass the amount of the loan. If the value of the collateral asset rises, everybody wins. If the price of the collateral asset drops, the lender must either pay the loan down, or post more collateral. This process has historically been known as a \u201Cmargin call\u201D and needless to say, it is a less-than-ideal experience for both parties.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Using bitcoin as collateral to get a dollar loan is becoming increasingly popular for many reasons. While Bitcoin has attributes that make it great collateral, it can be very volatile. And this means that, if you don\u2019t plan correctly, you may be in a position where you have to add more collateral to your loan when you\u2019re not physically able to. Whether you\u2019re asleep or tied up, a market move when you\u2019re unable to act is a bitcoin-backed loan borrower\u2019s nightmare. We understand this, and it is something that we\u2019ve been trying to address with technology here at Ledn.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Offering safer&nbsp;loans means giving our clients better options to protect their collateral. Our clients come to us because they don\u2019t want to sell their collateral in the first place, and we want to do whatever we can to help them protect it.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">First, we started by sending additional reminders and alerts when our client\u2019s loans reached critical levels, and we simplified the collateral top-up process on the platform. It helped many clients, but that still wasn\u2019t enough - we needed to make the process even easier.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Later, we introduced the ability to instantly process transfer assets from our client\u2019s Savings Accounts to their Loan Collateral address, so they would not have to wait for standard processing times or on-chain confirmations - and that helped even more clients.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But again, it wasn\u2019t enough. Bitcoin trades 24\/7 and we have clients all over the world. Regardless of when Bitcoin moved, some of our clients were inevitably asleep, or unable to access the internet - and they had the risk of being liquidated during a price drop.
