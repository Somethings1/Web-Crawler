This integration will allow users to send XRP assets cross-chain to heterogeneous blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, and Arbitrum, through Poly Network. The addition of cross-chain operations allows XRP users to participate in various financial services such as pledging assets, mining, lending, and liquidity provision using their XRP assets. With the addition of XRP Ledger to the Poly Network ecosystem, the network cluster effect grows larger, which creates improved asset interoperability for users amongst various public chains and project parties.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the support of Poly Network, multiple application scenarios open up for XRP to be used as an asset in DeFi. These application scenarios include; DEX trading, lending, and liquidity mining, amongst various heterogeneous blockchains and within the Layer 2 ecosystem. With Poly Network's \"multi-chain inter-crossing\" mechanism, XRP can realize instant low-cost cross-chain asset transfers. This mechanism works through a set of decentralized cross-chain nodes, <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">which work as a multi-signature account in XRPL Mainnet. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Users can transfer XRP to the <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">multi-signature <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">account <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">held by the cross-chain<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> node group. Simultaneously, the cross-chain nodes map the corresponding XRP cross-chain tokens on another heterogeneous blockchain, for example Ethereum. And for \"withdraw\", all Poly Network validator nodes will sign the withdraw transaction and submit to Poly Network's smart contract to assemble an XRP multi-signed transaction, then submit to XRPL by any relayer who is listening to the assembly event.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/xrpl.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">XRP Ledger<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is an open-source, green, permissionless and decentralized blockchain powered by the XRPL community and is the blockchain best suited to enable settlement and liquidity of tokenized assets at scale.

Its uniquely designed blockchain and cross-chain bridge technology open up communication and transactions between various heterogeneous chains, even amongst various mainstream public chains from the protocol layer. Following the mainnet launch in August 2020, over 375,000 addresses have used Poly Network\u2019s cross-chain service to complete cross-chain asset transfers of value equivalent to $16.3 billion.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Just as the Internet enables instant and seamless flows of information, Poly Network is working with XRP Ledger to achieve instant and seamless flows of value.
