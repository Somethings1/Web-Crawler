Hydrogen Technology Corp. that will be of most interest to crypto companies are the sections in the complaint that describe how the SEC regards routine token launch activity. It says that bounty programs (where users must complete a marketing task to receive free tokens), employee compensation and sales on secondary markets, should all have been registered as securities. Failing to register the sale of a security with the SEC is against the law.","\u201CThe hydro distributed by Hydrogen and Kane through the bounty programs, employee compensation and sales in the crypto asset trading market, including through Ostern, were offered and sold as investment contracts, and therefore were securities whose offer or sale required registration with the SEC unless an exemption from registration was available. Hydrogen and Kane did not file a registration statement with the SEC for their offers or sales of hydro, and no exemption from registration was available,\u201D the complaint states.","The company considered launching as an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/79838\/john-mcafee-sec-lawsuit-ico\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">initial coin offering<\/a>, but decided against that to avoid \u201Ccausing SEC problems,\u201D according to the complaint. Instead, a majority of the tokens were allocated to employees, developers and Hydrogen\u2019s own treasury. An airdrop was then planned in hopes of creating a broad market into which the company and its executives could sell their tokens.","Hydro was listed on 17 different platforms and exchanges: \u201CHydrogen and Kane used a strategy of listing hydro on as many low-trading volume platforms as possible in order to able to eventually have hydro listed on larger-volume and more-established trading platforms,\u201D the complaint says.","With that done, Kane and Hydrogen began selling their tokens while Moonwalkers\u2019 bot began buying them. The SEC quotes from their internal conversations, which describe a classic pump-and-dump scheme:","For example, on October 11, 2018, just days after the hydro market manipulation began, Ostern told Kane that he was \u201Cstarting off slow, trying to keep the sell pressure minimal until [he could] build enough capital to really get the market moving upward\u201D and indicated that they would \u201Chave plenty of excuses to pump price and sell into the FOMO [fear of missing out] guys down the road.\u201D Two weeks later, Ostern told Kane about his \u201Cvolume shenanigans\u201D on a popular, high-volume crypto asset trading platform, and bragged that it had taken his bot \u201Cabout 3 seconds\u201D to generate the illusion that \u201Ca million\u201D hydro tokens had been bought and sold \u2014 \u201C[a]round half\u201D of which Ostern admitted was \u201Cfake.\u201D","Worse, although Hydrogen marketed hydro as having the ability to become an \"API key\" to a non-blockchain business built on one of the Hydro platforms' on-chain apps, it turned out to have no functionality at all, according to the SEC:","\u2026 as Kane acknowledged in a private communication with Ostern in late January 2019, Hydrogen\u2019s \u201CAPI clients\u201D were not required to use hydro in any part of the Hydrogen platform. Ostern replied, \u201COh really? So everything is fiat [currency] and the token has no real utility?\u201D \u2014 to which Kane responded, \u201Cnot right now...\u201D","The company made $2.2 million in profit from the scam.","Another giveaway that Hydrogen knew it should have registered hydro with the SEC was Kane\u2019s skittishness about whether hydro actually provided any value or not. The complaint says that Kane told one Hydrogen board member that hydro \u201CWILL have value.\u201D Then, in a February 17, 2018, email, the same board member wrote to Kane: \u201C[a]s everyone has acknowledged that these digital assets [hydro] may accrete in value over time, your contention that this [the airdrop] was merely a software delivery is tenuous.\u201D","\u201CA few days later, at a Hydrogen board meeting, the same investor and board member insisted several times that it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019 for Hydrogen to continue to claim hydro tokens had no value.\u201D","Here's Hydrogen's internal chart showing how it saw the legal risks of launching its token:","","","Â© 2023 The Block.
