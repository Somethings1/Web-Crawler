The exchange\u2019s daily volume has collapsed from last year's highs of around $4 billion to about $284 million this past October, according to data from Nomics, and withdrawals are on their way back up as users and investors remove their funds from the platform.","In the interview, Marszalek reiterated that the exchange has a strong balance sheet and said its exposure to FTX was limited to $10 million, down from a possible $1 billion in business the two exchanges had together earlier.","\u201CWe recovered $990 million from FTX,\u201D Marszalek said, pointing out that fund flows between exchanges are a necessary part of the business.","He also said that 20% of Crypto.com's reserves are in Shibu Inu coin because that's what the customers trade, and everything in its reserves is backed 1-to-1 versus customer crypto deposits.","An audit of Crypto.com is underway, but it will take some time. Audit firms \u201Cdon\u2019t work at crypto speed,\u201D he said, emphasizing that Crypto.com and the industry both need full transparency to move forward.","Withdrawals are working as expected, he reiterated. The only stoppage has been related to GALA, SRM, and Ray.","\u201CSRM is closely tied to FTX,\u201D he said.","Marszalek said that CRO, Crypto.com\u2019s token, has never been used as loan collateral, unlike the relationship between FTX and Alameda and FTX's token, FTT.","\u201CWe\u2019re never going to raise funds,\u201D he added, stating that the business is cash flow positive.","One of Crypto.com\u2019s more controversial moves has been stadium sponsorship, with eye-watering price tags. There are questions about how effective the whole thing is as a sales funnel. Marszalek says it is a worthwhile investment, reminding people that the contracts are paid yearly.","\u201CWe pay a small amount every year, which amounts to around 10% of our revenue. This is not crazy compared to other companies,\u201D he said. \u201CGrowth to 70 million users is not possible without some investment into brand awareness.\u201D","Part of the market\u2019s mistrust of Crypto.com might stem from the exchange\u2019s recent $400 million mishap, where it accidentally sent ether to an account at an exchange called Gate.io. That was the second time the company had mistakenly transferred an amount in the millions. In August, it was revealed the exchange had sent $10.5 million to a woman in Melbourne, and took seven months to notice.","Marszalek explained that all addresses for transfers of these scales are whitelisted and approved. The destination address was Crypto.com\u2019s corporate account at Gate.io, and the funds were returned after Gate.io raised the corporate account\u2019s daily transfer limit.","\u201CThe funds were at no risk of being lost,\u201D Marszalek said. \u201CThe system would not allow us to send money somewhere it can\u2019t be recovered.\u201D","While some on crypto Twitter have speculated that this was part of a scheme to bolster Gate.io\u2019s holdings before its proof of reserves were published, Marszalek said this was not the case.","As for Crypto.com\u2019s critics Marszalek says he\u2019s looking forward to proving them wrong with actions and words.","\u201CTheir allegations have no substance,\u201D he said."],"entity":[{"type":"FTT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SRM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$284 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Marszalek","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"45%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ray","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$990 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"winter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shibu Inu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kris Marszalek","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Melbourne","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$400 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CRO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Crypto.com","Kris Marszalek","FTX","Cronos"],"authors":["Sam Reynolds"]}
