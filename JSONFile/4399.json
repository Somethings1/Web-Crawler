According to the proposal, the acquired tokens will be staked on Curve Finance to improve liquidity for Aave\u2019s stablecoin <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239688\/aave-dao-deploys-gho-stablecoin-on-ethereum-mainnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">GHO<\/a> on the platform.","The planned staking of the tokens will give Aave voting rights on the Curve platform, one of the largest decentralized exchanges. The action will enable Aave to exert influence over the distribution of token rewards and governance on the platform, including the allocation of new CRV rewards to designated liquidity pools.","\u201CThese tokens can be mobilized to incentivize GHO liquidity via locking them to gather Curve voting power and support a GHO-specific gauge,\u201D the proposal said.","The Aave community\u2019s decision to buy Curve tokens is likely part of a string of recent over-the-counter transactions undertaken by Michael Egorov with notable individuals in the cryptocurrency sector. Among these, Huobi\u2019s co-founder Jun Du <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/242925\/huobi-co-founder-jun-du-buys-10-million-crv-from-michael-egorov\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acquired<\/a> 10 million CRV tokens, while Tron\u2019s founder Justin Sun <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/242455\/justin-sun-buys-2-9-million-crv-tokens-in-an-otc-deal-announces-partnership-with-curve\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bought<\/a> 5 million CRV at a cost of $2 million. Crypto exchange Binance also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244183\/binance-labs-commits-5-million-to-invest-in-curve-dao-tokens\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">committed<\/a> a $5 million investment in Curve tokens.","Egorov has been engaging in several over-the-counter transactions, selling substantial quantities of Curve tokens. The action is aimed at alleviating his considerable loan obligations, which amount to roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/debank.com\/profile\/0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$47 million<\/a> against a significant portion of the CRV supply spread across different DeFi protocols. Within this context, Aave stands as a major creditor, with Egorov\u2019s debt to the project estimated at $20 million.","On-chain <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/spotonchain\/crv-founder-sold-crv-via-otc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a> aggregated by Spotonchain on Dune Analytics shows that Egorov has sold over 157.5 million CRV tokens to date, cumulatively amounting to $47.4 million.","Â© 2023 The Block.
