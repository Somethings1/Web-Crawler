The startup\u2019s profile and valuation have soared in the past few years thanks to several funding rounds \u2014 the most recent of which saw it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/12\/checkout-com-raises-1b-round-at-40b-valuation\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bank $1 billion<\/a> at a $40 billion valuation.","Since 2018, Checkout.com has been working with crypto firms to help them take payments in fiat currency. Houlgrave said the company works with 12 of the biggest 15 crypto exchanges.","The firm has doubled down on crypto this year.&nbsp;In June, it launched a new stablecoin settlement product, allowing merchant customers to have funds acquired through card payments settled in the form of stablecoin, with Checkout.com managing the mechanics. Such a tool could be particularly useful for crypto firms, which often manage their finances using stablecoins. Houlgrave said Checkout.com had recorded $300 million stablecoin settlements prior to announcing the product, and is at \u201Cmultiples of that now.\u201D","The company has also formed a dedicated crypto team with 30 staff. Houlgrave herself only took on the crypto strategy role in April, transitioning from chief of staff.","\u201CWe\u2019re continuing the grow the team and really we\u2019ve been doing that by focusing on people who have crypto experience and payments experience, which are hard to find,\u201D she said. \u201CI think we firmly believe in building sustainably in the long run and that means deeply understanding the industry and who we\u2019re building for.\u201D","Checkout.com\u2019s rivals in the payment space have also been busy embedding themselves into the crypto industry. In October last year, Worldpay president Jim Johnson outlined a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/121282\/whats-next-for-worldpays-fast-expanding-crypto-business\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">similar expansion<\/a> of the firm\u2019s crypto capabilities, in an interview with The Block. Stripe, too, has been working on the \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/13\/payments-giant-stripe-says-its-re-entering-the-crypto-market\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the future of web3 payments<\/a>.\u201D The prevailing bear market \u2014 and the numerous crypto outfits that have collapsed during it, such as Celsius and Three Arrows Capital \u2014 does not seem to have deterred the payments pros.","Nor does continued regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto. The US Treasury provided a reminder of that only yesterday by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162105\/us-treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-mixer-tornado-cash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sanctioning Tornado Cash<\/a>, a popular cryptocurrency mixing service that gave users a way to obscure transactions. &nbsp;","Checkout.com was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/2d427ed7-f9e4-46cf-a4c4-46429b19df5d\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">identified by the Financial Times<\/a> as a payments processor for Binance in June last year, after the Financial Conduct Authority warned that the exchange was not authorized to operate in the UK. Checkout.com clarified at the time that it had no relationship with Binance Markets Limit, the UK subsidiary named in the FCA warning.","\u201CWere we shaken? No. The reason being that although we process for a lot of the industry, we have developed pretty sophisticated onboarding processes and approaches to underwriting and legal,\u201D said Houlgrave. \u201CWe continuously review our position with existing merchants.\u201D","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/total-stablecoin-supply-daily\/embed\" title=\"Total Stablecoin Supply\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
