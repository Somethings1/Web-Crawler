This requirement previously necessitated an independent <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.arbitrum.io\/node-running\/how-tos\/data-availability-committee\/introduction\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data availability committee<\/a> capable of storing data and supplying it on demand.","\u201CBefore Celestia, throughput limitations forced developers building expressive onchain applications to migrate to alt-L1s or required the overhead of recruiting a committee to deploy their own chain,\u201D Celestia stated. \u201CWith Blobstream, developers can keep building in the Ethereum ecosystem.\"","Celestia developed Blobstream in collaboration with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284002\/paradigm-leads-55-million-round-in-zk-proofs-startup-succinct-lab-alongside-polygon-founders\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Succinct Labs<\/a>.
