Credit card deposits for existing users have already been stopped. The next step of the process takes place in December when the platform will suspend all crypto and U.S. dollar deposits. At that time, Bitfront will also cancel all open trading orders.","The final closure of withdrawals will happen on March 31, 2023, at 05:00 AM UTC. Bitfront advised customers to ensure they remove all of their funds from the platform on or before that date.","Bitfront cited the challenges of the \u201Crapidly evolving\u201D crypto market as part of the reason for shutting down the platform. The crypto exchange stated that it had tried to overcome these challenges to no avail.","For Bitfront, shuttering the platform is a necessary step to protect Line\u2019s blockchain ecosystem. \"<span data-ogsc=\"rgb(0, 124, 14)\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This decision to close is part of Line Blockchain's choice to focus on the businesses it is currently doing well and can do well,\" a spokesperson for Line told The Block. <\/span>Japanese social media giant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/57265\/messaging-giant-line-shuts-down-singapore-crypto-exchange-launches-a-global-platform-based-in-the-us\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Line launched Bitfront<\/a> in February 2020 as a U.S.-based exchange. At the time, the company had shut down its Singapore-based crypto exchange Bitbox.","Despite Bitfront shutting down, Line says it is not exiting the crypto space. \"<span data-ogsc=\"rgb(0, 124, 14)\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Line is preparing a new open network so that Link can be used more within various external exchanges and third-party ecosystems, as well as exchanges operated by Line,\" said the Line spokesperson.

The FTX collapse reportedly triggered a wave of liquidity outflows from exchanges. This has caused some smaller platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/190260\/aax-crypto-exchange-vp-ben-caselin-resigns-amid-liquidity-crisis?utm_source=cryptopanic&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AAX to experience solvency issues<\/a>.
