The initial lawsuit was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/42299\/class-action-lawsuit-against-bitfinex-and-tether-filed-by-lawyers-who-successfully-sued-craig-wright\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> in October 2019.","The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.courtlistener.com\/docket\/16298999\/110\/in-re-tether-and-bitfinex-crypto-asset-litigation\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">156-page amended lawsuit<\/a> alleges that the defendants manipulated the crypto market by fraudulently inflating prices and caused \u201Cbillions of dollars of damage\u201D to traders.","\u201CTether issued billions of USDT to itself with no U.S. dollar backing\u2014simply creating the USDT out of thin air,\u201D the filing says. \u201CTether hid that fact by \u2018selling\u2019 newly issued USDT to Bitfinex. [...] Because Bitfinex and Tether were essentially the same, Tether could simply transfer newly issued USDT into its account on Bitfinex without receiving U.S. dollars in exchange, as was required from genuine customers.\u201D","The amended lawsuit further alleges that Bittrex and Poloniex were \u201Cknowing participants in the scheme,\u201D meaning they knew that Bitfinex was transferring large amounts of unbacked USDT to their exchanges.","\u201CBittrex and Poloniex accepted these transfers and knowingly allowed Bitfinex and Tether\u2014as owners of the addresses holding the USDT\u2014to sell the debased USDT for cryptocommodities on their exchanges, driving up the cryptocommodity prices,\u201D says the filing.&nbsp;","There are also some revisions to the plaintiff list in the amended lawsuit. Crypto trader Matthew Script has been added as an additional plaintiff, while David Leibowitz has been removed as a plaintiff. Global Trade Solutions AG, which was initially one of the defendants, has now been removed in the amended filing.","It is worth noting that the initial lawsuit claimed the total damages of $1.4 trillion. The amended filing does not mention that amount. The plaintiffs are now rather seeking \u201Creasonable costs of suit, pre- and post-judgment interest, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201D and are demanding a trial by jury for all claims.","It remains to be seen what a jury decides. The plaintiffs are represented by Vel Freedman and Kyle Roche of Roche Cyrulnik Freedman LLP \u2013 the lawyers who are also involved in a federal lawsuit against Craig Wright from last year. Other representatives in the amended lawsuit are law firms Selendy &amp; Gay PLLC and Schneider Wallace Cottrell Konecky LLP.","Following publication of this article, Bitfinex and Tether released a statement denouncing the amended class-action lawsuit filing.","\u201CEven after taking three full months to amend their complaint, the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations remain untethered to either the facts or the law. They conflate perceived correlation with causation in an effort to prop up theories that are untrue and unsupportable,\" Bitfinex general counsel Stuart Hoegner said in a statement, going on to add: \"Bitfinex and Tether will vigorously defend themselves, their customers, their stakeholders, and the crypto community against these unfounded allegations and continue to counter fiction with facts.\"","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Editor's Note:<\/em><\/strong><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;This article has been updated to note that the lawsuit involving Craig Wright was not won.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["LAWSUITS","TETHER"]}
