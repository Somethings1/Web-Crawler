In July, it said it expected to monetize crypto into cash before returning to customers, though international customers may be able to access a rebooted exchange. Other bankrupt crypto firms such as lender Celsius have opted to make distributions in liquid cryptocurrencies including BTC and ETH.","The requests must be approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court, which earlier on Wednesday heard that legal fees were costing the company $1.5 million per day as it seeks to wind up. On Tuesday, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to a rejigged series of fraud charges relating to his management of the company.","Edited by Sandali Handagama."],"entity":[{"type":"$1.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Delaware","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Galaxy Asset Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"evening","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Security and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$3.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mike Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"John J.
