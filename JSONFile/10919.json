That's because FTX is litigating multiple clawback claims, or avoidance actions, trying to recover money it paid out in the weeks and months before becoming insolvent.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Given that some of these transfers are probably very significant and some of them were made to large organizations, which I'm sure are very capable of defending themselves, it's very possible that some of these things could last for a long time,\" Rosenberg told The Block in an interview.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Such claims are usually resolved in settlements outside court and don\u2019t go to trial, Rosenberg added, because it\u2019s generally less expensive to settle. However, negotiating the settlement can also take time.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While FTX is trying to claw back the money its former leadership generously spent, it\u2019s also fighting against a whopping <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/267102\/ftx-says-irs-demand-for-24-billion-in-unpaid-taxes-is-delaying-recovery-of-user-funds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$24 billion<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> claim from the Internal Revenue Service, which says the crypto exchange did not pay all of its taxes.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX has already <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/246007\/ftx-and-genesis-reach-agreement-for-175-million-payment-to-alameda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">settled<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> mutual adversary complaints with Genesis, a crypto firm that has yet to emerge from its own bankruptcy, and which had been a major creditor of FTX-affiliated trading firm Alameda Research,&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Similar complaints by FTX and Alameda have also not been resolved yet, including, among others, a lawsuit <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/262697\/ftx-sues-bybit-to-claw-back-nearly-1-billion-alleges-fraudulent-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">against crypto exchange ByBit<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> for $1 billion<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.

And my understanding is that FTX was throwing money all over the place, so there's a lot of targets,\u201D Rosenberg said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One of the key questions in such litigation is how to calculate the value of crypto over time, Rosenberg said. \"There hasn't been any definitive case law that I'm aware of on how cryptocurrency gets valued in avoidance action litigation.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One precedent that can potentially be used is the 2014 bankruptcy of a crypto firm <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/markets\/2016\/02\/22\/california-bankruptcy-judge-says-bitcoin-is-property-not-currency\/?_gl=1*im65pv*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTY5MTAzNzgwLjE3MDIyNjgxOTQ.*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTcwMjI2ODE5NC4xLjAuMTcwMjI2ODE5NC4wLjAuMA..\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HashFast<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, Rosenberg added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"It was a classic cryptocurrency avoidance issue, which is prior to the petition date, somebody was given a certain amount of crypto. And then by the time they got sued, that same amount of crypto was worth significantly more,\u201D he continued.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another painful question in crypto bankruptcies is how creditors should be paid, in crypto or in fiat money, and there are no official rules on that. However, given the amount and scope of bankruptcies in crypto recently, and the adoption of crypto by mainstream finance, Rosenberg hopes that new rules are soon to come.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"I'm hoping that these enormous crypto insolvency cases and the aftermath inspire legislators to come to some kind of a consent at least come up with a mechanism that will allow people to determine what kinds of crypto's could be distributed,\" the lawyer said.<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
