After allegedly raising $4.1 billion, the firm has agreed to pay a $24 million penalty for selling unregistered securities. That\u2019s a slap on the wrist\u200A\u2014\u200Aonly 0.6% of the total raise.","In <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/block.one\/news\/block-one-announces-settlement-with-us-securities-and-exchange-commission\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/block.one\/news\/block-one-announces-settlement-with-us-securities-and-exchange-commission\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a statement<\/a>, Block.one said that the settlement relates specifically to the ERC-20 tokens sold during the ICO, which are no longer in circulation. EOS transitioned from ERC-20 to its own chain in June 2018. These tokens will not be required to be registered as a security with the SEC. Moreover, Block.one said that this settlement resolves all ongoing matters between them and the SEC.","If you recall, this settlement only reinforces the previous statements made by SEC officials. The SEC\u2019s Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/speech-hinman-061418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/speech-hinman-061418\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said in June 2018<\/a> that the sale of ETH did not represent securities transactions because the network was already \u2018sufficiently decentralized.\u2019 Hester Peirce <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/peirce-regulation-view-inside-machine\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said in February 2019<\/a> that the tokens sold for use in a functioning network, rather than as investment contracts, fall outside the definition of securities.&nbsp;","Ethereum escaped the fines likely because it was much harder for the SEC to go after anyone. Similarly to Ethereum, EOS was an unregistered security at the time of sale but since it has transitioned to a functioning \u201Cdecentralized\u201D network, the SEC no longer requires it to register as a security and it can be traded on all cryptocurrency exchanges.","But let\u2019s talk about the elephant in the room\u200A\u2014\u200Athe precedent that this sets for other companies thinking of issuing a token. Let\u2019s take Blockstack for example. Blockstack <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/blockstack-now-with-enough-runway-till-end-of-2021-but-the-quality-of-apps-on-the-network-needs-improvement-40037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/blockstack-now-with-enough-runway-till-end-of-2021-but-the-quality-of-apps-on-the-network-needs-improvement-40037\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recently completed<\/a> the first SEC-approved token offering, raising $23 million between its Reg A+ offering for the general public as well as its Reg S offering for institutional investors in Asia. But Blockstack <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/sec-clears-blockstack-to-hold-first-regulated-token-offering-11562794848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/sec-clears-blockstack-to-hold-first-regulated-token-offering-11562794848\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">spent<\/a> 10 months and about $2 million getting SEC approval for the Reg A+ sale. That\u2019s 8.7% of the total raise in contrast to 0.6% that Block.one had to pay to the SEC.","Arguably, since Blockstack paved the way for compliant utility token fundraises, other companies won\u2019t have to spend as much cash or time for doing the same. But the costs will still be significant.&nbsp;","Now, who would you rather be? Block.one or Blockstack? Blockstack has a \u2018runway\u2019 of less than 3 years, has to file ongoing reports, submit audited financial statements and on top of that, its tokens must be traded on a regulated securities exchange in the U.S. with virtually no liquidity. Block.one, on the other hand, raised several billion dollars, has decades of \u2018runway\u2019, got slapped on the wrist with a minuscule fine, has regulatory clarity and EOS can also be listed on all cryptocurrency exchanges with a ton of liquidity. Tough choice, right?&nbsp;","Just to put this in perspective, Block.one has so much money they <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/25741\/block-one-poured-150-million-into-its-new-social-media-platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/25741\/block-one-poured-150-million-into-its-new-social-media-platform\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">spent $150 million<\/a> on developing its social media site Voice.com. The domain itself cost Block.one $30 million, which is more than Blockstack raised in their compliant fundraise and also more than the SEC\u2019s fine.","So why would other companies want to follow in Blockstack\u2019s compliant footsteps when they can just promise a ton of really cool (undeliverable) features, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeffscottward\/status\/879434713114578946\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeffscottward\/status\/879434713114578946\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">advertise on Times Square<\/a>, raise a ton of cash that they can use to pay for really good lawyers and then get away with it? The answer is\u200A\u2014\u200AI have no clue. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see a resurgence of new ICOs doing the same as Block.one."],"hashtag":["SEC"]}
