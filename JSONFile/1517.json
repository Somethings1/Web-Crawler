However, in spite of these events, KPMG said investor sentiment remains strong, with the average mid-year investment level well above that of years prior to 2021, despite a decline from $32.1 billion in 2021 to $14.2 billion in 2022.","Source: Pulse of Fintech H1'22, Global Analysis of Investment in Fintech, KPMG International (data provided by PitchBook), *as of 30 June 2022.","However, waters may still be uncertain for some blockchain startups, which KPMG France Director of Blockchain and Crypto Assets Alexandre Stachtchenko said may need to cut valuations to raise money because it\u2019s the only option. \u201COf course, some cryptos will die out \u2014 particularly those that don\u2019t have clear and strong value propositions. That could actually be quite healthy from an ecosystem point of view because it\u2019ll clear away some of the mess that was created in the euphoria of a bull market. The best companies will be the ones that survive,\u201D he said.","The companies that are surviving continue to drive interest into the blockchain space and rake in venture capital with big raises by Germany-based Trade Republic at $1.1 billion, Bahamas-based FTX at $500 million, and ConsenSys at $450 million.","The face of crypto investors is changing dynamically from retailer investors to institutional and corporate players who constitute a growing share of&nbsp; the capital influx. As such, from an investment risk perspective crypto assets are beginning to exhibit similarities to traditional assets, KPMG said in its report.","Since both El Salvador and the Central African Republic have adopted bitcoin as legal tender, the report said there is an increasing interest in the sovereign applications of cryptocurrencies among developing nations as opposed to that of existing currencies such as the U.S. dollar. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAlthough a crypto trading ban stands in China, and there are indications that India may follow suit, regulators in other jurisdictions are more interested in fostering competition, evolution, and growth in crypto markets while protecting consumers, KPMG said. In addition the EU will adopt new regulations for the cryptocurrency industry at the end of 2022.","Expect increased interest in stablecoins. Corporations are looking at stablecoins to better leverage the operational advantages of crypto, including such as reductions in costs and delays, increased visibility, more rapid liquidity, and greater ease of use, KPMG said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
