The proposed launch follows extensive community discussions through multiple phases of governance and months of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210092\/aaves-gho-stablecoin-goes-live-on-ethereums-goerli-testnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">testing<\/a> on Ethereum's Goerli testnet.","Facilitators are used to generate and burn GHO tokens, with the proposal combining two previously approved Facilitators: the Aave V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator and the FlashMinter Facilitator.","The Aave V3 Ethereum Pool Facilitator will allow users to borrow GHO using collateral deposited in the V3 Ethereum mainnet pool. The FlashMinter Facilitator enables users to flash mint GHO without collateral, providing it is repaid in a single transaction, enhancing GHO's ability to maintain its peg through efficient arbitrage.","The proposal includes a plan to use Staked Aave (stkAAVE) tokens as a mechanism to reduce the borrowing cost for GHO stablecoin users. stkAAVE represents a staked version of the Aave token.","Aave Companies is also considering a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233419\/aave-companies-gho-stablecoin-proposal-ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">multi-chain strategy<\/a> following the proposed GHO launch on Ethereum.","Â© 2023 The Block.
