That bearish price activity, however, is happening against a backdrop of crypto firms raising hundreds of millions in equity financing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rosenblum cut his teeth as an oil trader at Goldman Sachs before launching the crypto trading firm and market maker GSR in 2013. Today, GSR trades billions of dollars worth of crypto. He said what we are seeing is not a bear market.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI'd say we're in more of a stasis. I think that the market is getting more iterated, more complex than \u2018do I buy it and hold it for this rampant bear market or do I get short?\u2019 I think we're a bit in between here.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Indeed, the private market in crypto startups is heating up, with FTX announcing its own $900 million Series B raise this week. In total, data from The Block Research shows companies have raised $6.2 billion this year. Rosenblum added:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSo I do think that the drop in the market really isn't evident for what I think is going to happen in the future of prices. If you look at private market valuations, many of these valuations are up 50 percent or doubled in the past two or three months. So, certainly the private equity companies that are coming to the space and looking there, they've got more firepower than the VC\u2019s and they're not afraid to spend. So there's a lot of building, but the price of a token dropping by 50 percent in two or three months, I think it's pushed away not only in retail, but some of the institutional investors. So the token landscape is a little bit quieter. But as say, it's down but not out.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">We also discuss:<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
