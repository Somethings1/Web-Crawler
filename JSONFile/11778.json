It launched the protocol last month, consisting of Creator HQ and a javascript SDK. \"Creator HQ is a no-code creation and management hub for artists to customize and build unique NFT projects and manage their revenue, splits, metadata and more,\" Collier said. \"The SDK allows any developer to build on top of and customize our smart contracts and infrastructure with just a few lines of javascript \u2014 a far more globally known language than Solidity (which is what smart contracts are written in).\"","Collier likened the Decent protocol with what Squarespace does for websites and Canva does for design.","With fresh capital in hand, Decent will expand its team of six by hiring one more full-stack engineer, Collier said.","The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/136325\/heres-the-next-big-thing-in-nfts-according-to-multicoin-capitals-kyle-samani\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NFT\/gaming vertical<\/a> of the crypto sector continues to grab the most venture capital at the seed stage amid the so-called crypto winter, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/november-blockchain-funding-recap-2-192941\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block Research wrote recently<\/a>.
