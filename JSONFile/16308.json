If Amanda Cassatt has her way, \u201CCrypto: The Musical\u201D could be the next show to hit Broadway.","The musical \u2013 still in the very early stages of development \u2013 will tell the story of Zoe, a woman who leaves her corporate job to join a crypto startup, \u201Cand the many absurdities, heartbreaks and triumphs she experiences along the way.\u201D","Much like the project\u2019s main character, the team behind \u201CCrypto: The Musical\u201D will face their own heartbreaks and absurdities in their bid for Broadway. Producing a musical doesn\u2019t come cheap, so Cassatt \u2013 the CEO of Web3 marketing agency Serotonin \u2013 turned to the crypto community for help fundraising.","Cassatt set up MusicalDAO, a self-described decentralized autonomous organization that allows donors to contribute to the project\u2019s funding in exchange for pre-sale tickets and other privileges, including naming a character or making an on-stage cameo. A minimum donation of $1,000 \u2013 paid in either stablecoins USDT or USDC \u2013 is required to join the DAO. Once the DAO reaches 1,500 individual contributors, membership will close and the project will go before Broadway investors to get the real cash it needs to debut.","Cassatt was reluctant to share with CoinDesk the number of people who have contributed funds, but said the reception to the project, which debuted at CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, last month, has been \u201Cgreat\u201D so far.","On-chain data paints a slightly different picture. According to Etherscan, the designated donation address cryptothemusical.eth had received a singular $1,000 stablecoin contribution by press time.","A spokesperson for the project told CoinDesk that while the address was correct, the creative team is in no hurry to raise money.","\u201CIt\u2019s early days for this project. It typically takes years to put together Broadway musicals,\u201D the spokesperson told CoinDesk. \u201CWe\u2019re starting to see a community gather. Web3 is all about experimentation, community building, and creating new models to shake up how things are traditionally done, and that\u2019s what [the show] is all about.\u201D","The online crypto community\u2019s tepid response to the project isn\u2019t entirely surprising. Cassatt acknowledges the \u201Cstrange bedfellows juxtaposition\u201D of a crypto-themed musical. (\u201CI think that\u2019s what makes it funny,\u201D she told CoinDesk.) Strange bedfellows or not, \u201CCrypto: The Musical\u201D wouldn\u2019t be crypto\u2019s first foray into the world of Broadway: the longtime musical \u201CDear Evan Hansen\u201D partnered with Roblox earlier this year to release a non-fungible token (NFT) collection benefitting a children\u2019s mental health charity.","It doesn\u2019t help the project\u2019s launch has coincided with the onslaught of crypto winter: Major players in the crypto space are declaring bankruptcy and dropping like flies, and layoffs are accelerating across the industry.","Cassatt is hopeful her show can thrive in the bear market anyway.","\u201CI think in this market, selling things to audiences at a million-dollar price point isn\u2019t always the right thing, but I think reaching people where they are and bringing in more supporters at a grassroots level \u2026 makes a lot of sense,\u201D Cassatt told CoinDesk.","\u201CTo do something entertaining and interesting and off-the-beaten path \u2013 I think this is the kind of lightness that the community needs and wants during this time,\u201D she said.","The project\u2019s executive producers, composer Daniel Mertzlufft and Macy Schmidt, were part of the team behind the delirious COVID-19 pandemic spectacle, \u201CRatatouille: The TikTok Musical.\u201D Cassatt\u2019s company, Serotonin, will produce \u201CCrypto: The Musical\u201D alongside two Tony Award-winning producers.","Crypto-themed songs, including one about the Howey Test \u2013 a legal metric for determining what qualifies as a security \u2013 and another about NFTs, called \u201CRight Click Save\u201D will provide the soundtrack for \u201CCrypto: The Musical.\u201D Even the project\u2019s ostensibly non-crypto songs are dripping with crypto references; in a love song sung by the main character, she references being \u201Ctethered to a stable man.\u201D","But Mertzlufft told CoinDesk that while he wants the project\u2019s songs to showcase the team\u2019s knowledge, he\u2019s wary of turning it into the \u201C\u2018Schoolhouse Rock\u2019 of Web3.\u201D","\u201CThere\u2019s lots of little things in there where if you know, you know and, if not, it\u2019s just a song,\u201D Mertzlufft said. \u201COur character, Zoe, is also not a Web3 person at the beginning of the show, so an audience member who is also not a Web3 person learns along with her. The goal is that you never feel like you\u2019re being forced to learn.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Zoe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cassatt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Macy Schmidt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Daniel Mertzlufft","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Austin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Evan Hansen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Texas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Roblox","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"TikTok Musical","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Big Apple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus festival","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tony Award","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mertzlufft","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Amanda Cassatt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Etherscan","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["New York","DAO","Web 3.0"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
