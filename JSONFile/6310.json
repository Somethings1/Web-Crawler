The first phase of its mainnet was introduced in June.","Yesterday, EigenLayer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz\/launch-of-the-stage-2-testnet-eigenlayer-eigenda\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">activated<\/a> this second phase on its test network to enable operator registration and commencement of EigenDA verification.","This step follows the project\u2019s initial launch, which brought re-staking to the Ethereum mainnet with limited utility. The upcoming phase is expected to enhance this functionality.","EigenDA will be the first service to be actively validated (AVS) on EigenLayer, indicating a system that relies on re-staking and obtains validation through EigenLayer.","The deployment of EigenDA is anticipated to decrease transaction fees for rollups. This may have a positive impact on the scaling of decentralized applications, especially in segments such as decentralized gaming and social media platforms, where transaction costs have historically been a constraint.","EigenLabs, the team behind EigenLayer, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222901\/eigenlayer-series-a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">closed<\/a> a $50 million Series A funding round led by Blockchain Capital in March.","The total amount of value in EigenLayer\u2019s smart contracts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/246998\/eigenlayers-tvl-nears-240-million-as-it-gears-up-for-eigenworlds-nft-mint?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crossed<\/a> $240 million after the platform\u2019s second round of deposit caps for liquid staking assets such as stETH, rETH and cbETH were filled quickly in August.","Â© 2023 The Block.
