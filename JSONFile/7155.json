Some of those will also evolve into institutional offerings.\u201D Said Fang.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Okcoin announced on The Scoop that they will be launching a \u201CSATs Mode\u201D in an effort to cater to retail client demand for Bitcoin. That SATs mode will mean an ability to package and sell Satoshis, or 1,000th of a bitcoin. Since bitcoin holders often hold only a portion of a bitcoin in decimals, Okcoin wants to make clients feel comfortable with Sats in order to make transactions easier to understand. This<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> announcement comes on the heels of Okcoin's integration of Lightning, the layer 2 micropayment protocol used for sending small amounts of Bitcoin. Okcoin is expecting to use this retail lead offering as an opportunity to test the waters for such a product for institutional grade clients. <\/span>","\"I'm not worried about looking at who else is eating the cake. I'm looking at how we can serve the cake and how big the cake needs to be.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In an attempt to capture more DeFi exposure for institutional clients, Okcoin recently also launched an Earn APY offering for institutions following their retail offering. In their view, Okcoin is focusing its business on participating in a decentralized future, though they acknowledge that as DeFi adoption grows the business could still evolve into something very different than an exchange, such as a DAO. \u201CUltimately everyone will own their own data,\u201D Said Fang.<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
