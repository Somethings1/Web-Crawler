The founders of the exchange recently settled with the regulator to the tune of $250,000. As part of the complaint against Ooki DAO, the CFTC says community members who participated in governance votes are liable for Ooki\u2019s alleged wrongdoings.","DAO members are now <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.ooki.com\/t\/future-of-ooki-dao\/456\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">discussing<\/a> the appropriate response to the CFTC\u2019s lawsuit. One of these responses involves allocating treasury funds towards legal counsel for DAO members.","The Ooki community is also mulling the idea of raising additional funds for a possible legal challenge of the CFTC\u2019s complaint. One possible route proposed by the DAO member who initiated these discussions is to submit a grant proposal on Gitcoin to raise funds for the legal defense. The idea here is to elicit support from the broader DeFi and crypto community to support the Ooki DAO's legal fight. \u201CInsofar as all DAOs have a stake in the outcome, broad community support of Ooki DAO\u2019s legal defense is critical,\u201D the forum post stated.","NFTs have also been identified as another possible fundraising route for the DAOs legal defense. The community is discussing the possibility of releasing an NFT collection to raise funds for the endeavor.","These discussions could lead to a possible vote on the matter. Early reactions within the community have so far been supportive of the motions raised in the forum post.","The CFTC\u2019s lawsuit against Ooki DAO did <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172416\/whats-next-for-daos-breaking-down-the-cftcs-latest-enforcement-action\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">elicit strong reactions<\/a> from a cross-section of the crypto space.
