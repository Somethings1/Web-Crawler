Leverage allows traders to control a position size with a smaller amount of capital. While this can amplify profits, it also magnifies losses. As traders take larger positions, price swings are intensified, contributing to increased volatility.","The recent drop in the bitcoin price has led to a substantial liquidation of long positions on centralized exchanges. The volatility resulted in the liquidations of more than $147 million in bitcoin positions, with the majority ($127 million) being longs.","The overall <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/269991\/crypto-exchange-volume-cracks-1-trillion-for-first-time-since-late-2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto<\/a> market saw over $571 million of liquidated long positions in the last 24 hours, contributing to a total of $642 million in liquidations across various centralized exchanges, according to CoinGlass <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinglass.com\/LiquidationData\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a>.","In derivatives markets, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/269881\/bitcoin-price-spike-above-45800-caused-over-73-million-in-short-liquidations\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">liquidations<\/a> take place when a trader's position is forcibly closed due to insufficient funds to cover losses.
