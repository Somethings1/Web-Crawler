Due to the opportunity and risk of frontier tech, the people, strategies, norms and structures are completely different than a traditional tech market. Matt Turck of FirstMark Capital had a great description of&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/mattturck.com\/frontiertech\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\" data-href=\"http:\/\/mattturck.com\/frontiertech\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201Cfrontier tech\u201D in 2016<\/a>:","<span class=\"markup--quote markup--blockquote-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"b0f9b289d536\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I love the term \u201Cfrontier\u201D because it beautifully captures the opportunities and perils involved. It sounds like a wide-open opportunity, adventurous, perhaps even romantic.

Cut your teeth at a sure thing, engage in business with a genteel crowd, exchange ideas in a safe and protected space with norms galore, do your two years or four years, then enter the real world with your post-grad credential. It\u2019s a wonderful existence, one that I myself enjoyed, but it doesn\u2019t bring the fear, excitement, glory or failure that frontier tech brings.<\/span>","<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"b0f9b289d536\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In today\u2019s world, established tech markets are the colonies under the auspice of Big Tech: communications, information, e-commerce, consumer services and the like.<\/span>&nbsp;Growth is assured in many markets\u200A\u2014\u200Aand it is a matter of how the spoils it will be divided. In other markets, saturation is complete and it is simply a matter of which empires will evolve and which will be forgotten in 20 years.&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"4e09a5028372\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The frontier is where nearly everything is yet to be discovered, where one market may reveal a territory rich with spoils and one may reveal a market of ghost towns and tumbleweed.

All can see something better\u200A\u2014\u200Abut it is impossible to translate fully what is in one\u2019s mind to another\u2019s mind. What is certain to one is uncertain to another. The path looks different to each. And while there is a glorious outcome in the future, it has infinite forms.<\/span>&nbsp;There is the Bitcoin maximalist tribe, the Ethereum disciples, the security token believers and the enterprise blockchain evangelists.&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"26c75f0fc3fd 2a3570f40e1c\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Each believes in their own purity of purpose of intentions, while many show skepticism at the purity and purpose of others who don\u2019t think the same way.

It is not an arena for the faint of heart, the half-committed or the non-believer. It is not an arena for the unprepared.","The strategies in frontier tech are different.&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"e7c36ee7f624\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The most valuable creations to date in blockchain and crypto are open source even if the initial teams horde large quantities of the expected return in the form of founder tokens.<\/span>&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"9d4d50f8260a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whereas cloning is frowned upon in established tech, it is openly embraced in the blockchain ecosystem.&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"9d4d50f8260a c85c6404c0f9 4e09a5028372\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whereas evolution is rewarded in established tech, revolution is rewarded in the blockchain ecosystem; incremental thinking and building is exceedingly rare\u200A\u2014\u200Aand tends to result in failure<\/span><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"9d4d50f8260a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"9d4d50f8260a dc5f49b3b353\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whereas walled gardens and centralization is rewarded in established tech, decentralization and trust by design is rewarded in the blockchain ecosystem.<\/span>","The norms of behavior in frontier tech are different.

It is unusual for one to change their mind in the heat of debate but not unusual for one to change their mind in the face of changed conditions: the introduction of new technology or the movement of 24\/7 markets. And in the end, that which feels personal in the moment is quickly forgotten as the next idea or concept comes to the forefront of the individual or collective mind.","Business formation is different in frontier tech. Blockchain \/ crypto investments look more like \u201Cbets\u201D, premised on teams, ideas and reputations than on early results.
