The SEC charged the crypto exchange in June for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange, broker and clearing agency.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The Court should reject Coinbase's attempt to narrow and misapply the established legal framework in order to avoid being subject to the same regulatory obligations as all other participants in the Nation\u2019s securities markets. And the Court should decline to treat digital assets as somehow special,\" the association said.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC\u2019s case against Coinbase isn\u2019t \u201Cextraordinary,\u201D the association said, citing the Howey Test, a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case involving citrus groves that the SEC often uses to determine whether transactions are investment contracts and thus subject to securities laws. Some in the crypto industry have disagreed with the SEC\u2019s application of that court case.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC\u2019s position that certain digital assets are investment contracts under the test is \u201Cwell within the bounds of established law,\u201D NASAA said.&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC is not making new policy when it comes to digital assets and is instead enforcing the existing law, NASAA argued in its brief.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt cannot be the law that an agency must have explicit Congressional authorization to apply existing law to new fact patterns in complex and evolving financial markets,\u201D the association said.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lawmakers have introduced a number of bills to regulate crypto, though none have yet become enacted. Two bills, one that would regulate stablecoins, and another that takes a comprehensive approach at creating a regulatory framework for crypto, passed through a House committee over the summer and await a full House vote and a tough Senate vote.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAlthough Congress may eventually legislate a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the future, it has not done so. It is also possible that Congress will not do so,\u201D the association said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NASAA also pushed back against assertions that the major questions doctrine can be applied to crypto.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The doctrine says that if an agency wants to decide on an issue that has major national significance, it has to be supported by clear congressional authorization.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The major questions doctrine has two parts \u2014 one focused on whether the subject has a major impact on the nation\u2019s economy or on the public, and the second is whether a federal agency has explicit authority to implement new regulations.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The crypto industry can\u2019t be meaningfully compared in terms of economic and political significance to cases related to the major questions doctrine, NASAA said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAs an initial matter, digital assets cannot reasonably be considered a sufficiently significant component of the American economy because there is no practical economic use case identified or widely adopted for the vast majority of digital assets, other than speculation,\u201D NASAA wrote.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NASAA represents state and provincial securities regulators in the U.S., Canada and Mexico with a mission to protect investors from fraud and abuse.
