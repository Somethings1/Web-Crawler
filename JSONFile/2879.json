For the first half of this year, Meten incurred a net loss of $26 million on a revenue of $67 million. About 20% of the revenue came from online and offline tutoring for juniors.&nbsp;","When Meten was listed in March 2020, its stock price went up to as much as $27 and had since then maintained around $15 until August that year when it disclosed a net loss of $30 million for the first half of 2020.","Its stock performance kept declining since then and dropped below $1 in May this year, which was worsened by a Reuters exclusive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/finance\/exclusive-china-planning-new-crackdown-private-tutoring-sector-sources-2021-05-12\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a> that China was poised to ban K-12 private tutoring businesses on school curriculum subjects \u2013 particularly math and English \u2013 in two months.","China's competitive education system has bolstered the growth of for-profit tutoring businesses over the past decades but the government is now aiming to reduce the educational pressure on both children and parents in its bid to encourage the country's birthrate.","The official crackdown notice was released in July and a wider market sell-off at the time caused Meten's stock price to reach as low as $0.28. But it has since then bounced back to $0.55, although is still 98% off its listing high.","Meten said in its 2021 interim earnings report that the July ban may \"materially and adversely affect\" its business operations, financial condition and prospects.&nbsp;","Over the past four years, there have been both success and failure stories of struggling Chinese public companies tapping into Bitcoin mining to bolster its original business lines.&nbsp;","For instance, BIT Mining, previously known as the sports lottery firm 500.com, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/96817\/chinese-state-owned-capital-500-bitcoin-mining\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">started<\/a> its Bitcoin mining pivot in early 2019 and has grown into a serious operation. It has avoided much of the limelight until early this year when it formally announced the pivot and the acquisition over mining pool BTC.com.","Others, like China-listed mobile app developer Wholeasy, were not so lucky. Its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2019\/12\/23\/lawsuit-shows-how-a-public-firms-80m-bet-on-bitcoin-miners-went-terribly-wrong\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$80 million investment<\/a> in Bitcoin mining equipment in 2018 and subsequent infrastructure build-out in the U.S. went wrong eventually and led to almost negligible returns.","For its part, Meten admitted that it has no prior experience and has \"no assurance\" that its Bitcoin mining effort will succeed.","\"With respect to our plan to develop our blockchain and cryptocurrency business, we may not be able to acquire cryptocurrency mining machines at a reasonable cost, or at all,\" the firm said in the September prospectus. \"Due to our limited experience with blockchain and cryptocurrency activities, we also face challenges and uncertainties relating to the possibility of success of our new business.\"","It appears Meten's mining equipment purchase from AGM was already at a higher cost than the market rate.","In an announcement on Wednesday, AGM said it sold 10,000 units of its new generation of Bitcoin miners to another U.S-listed Chinese mining firm CCNC for $65 million, which is about 18% cheaper per unit than what Meten paid for.","Â© 2023 The Block.
