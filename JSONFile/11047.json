MEV stands for maximal extractable value and it refers to the premium that block producers can charge for specially reordering or censoring transaction blocks. This premium is in excess of the normal transaction fee. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/139155\/mev-bots-earn-476000-by-targeting-large-stablecoin-swaps\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arbitrageurs use MEV<\/a> to bribe miners or validators to place their transactions in specific blocks for significant financial gains. When used nefariously, MEV can lead to front-running and sandwich attacks.","The MEV-Boost is Flashbots\u2019 latest offering for fair and transparent MEV extraction. By \u201Copen sourcing\u201D its code, Flashbots says it is making the Ethereum transaction block market even more competitive.","Flashbots also stated that the open source relay code for MEV-Boost is licensed under an aggressive coy-left license, also known as AGPL. This type of license prescribes open source development of derivatives from the parent code.","\u201CWe encourage all teams to develop their relays in the open, and for community members to trust relays only if they act consistent with AGPL norms of transparency and free software, Flashbots advised.\u201D","The project\u2019s decision to open source its relay code comes amid fears that relay providers for crypto services could <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163415\/tornado-cash-developer-arrest-sparks-fears-of-global-crypto-enforcement\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">come under regulatory pressure<\/a>.
