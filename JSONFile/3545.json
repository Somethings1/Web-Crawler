The valuation was not disclosed.&nbsp;","Root will be built on top of Beanstalk, a stablecoin protocol that was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/142272\/ethereum-based-stablecoin-protocol-beanstalk-loses-more-than-80-million-to-exploit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hacked<\/a> in April this year through a governance exploit.

Investors can buy Beanstalk debt assets known as \"pods\" that function like time-vested bonds, paying out an annual interest rate.","Root will expand on this offering by aiming to develop markets such as interest rate swaps on Beanstalk yields and a sports betting platform. The funds from the round will primarily be used to directly invest in Beanstalk, as well as to help audit the protocol. Root is hoping to launch in October.&nbsp;","As a \"credit-based stablecoin,\" Bean is not meant to maintain a hard peg and is supposed to oscillate above and below the $1 mark, according to Patel.&nbsp;","Given the distinction, Patel said he would prefer not to use the term stablecoin at all.&nbsp;","\"I think I would call it a non-convertible low volatility token \u2014 algorithmic stablecoin is a trigger word these days and I don't blame people,\" he added.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
