But W&K says Wright never fully provided the personal information needed to enforce the payment, and has asked the court to conduct contempt of court proceedings, and impose fines of $250,000 per day.","\u201COn the present record, there is prima facie evidence of contemptuous conduct,\u201D Reinhart said in response to that request, saying Wright had \u201Crefused to provide basic information about his spouse and her assets\u201D on the form.","Wright\u2019s claim that the form should be kept for attorney\u2019s eyes only to avoid revealing sensitive personal data \u201Cis factually false\u2026the designation was improper from the beginning,\u201D Reinhart said.","The form, now unsealed by Reinhart, gives Satoshi Nakomoto as Wright\u2019s nickname or alias, and states that his assets have been transferred or assigned to others.","Wright and his attorneys have until May 18 to show why they should not face a sanction for seeking to keep information confidential, under legal provisions designed to stop unreasonable or vexatious inflation of court costs. A further hearing on July 6 in Palm Beach, Florida, will consider the facts linked to the alleged non-compliance.","Wright \u2013 who has argued the information he provided on the form was accurate, but that he is unable or legally restricted from providing some of the data requested \u2013 will be given a further opportunity to make that case, Reinhart said.","In April, a judge at the High Court in England ruled it wasn\u2019t in the public interest to continue to pursue contempt of court proceedings against Wright even if there was, at first sight, evidence that he had revealed details of a judgment before it was supposed to be published.","In December, Wright was granted permission to appeal a Norwegian court\u2019s finding that social media user Magnus Granath, also known as Hodlonaut, had been entitled to post tweets in 2019 calling Wright a \u201Cfraud\u201D and a \u201Cscammer\u201D for his claim to be Sastoshi.","Read more: Craig Wright\u2019s UK Contempt of Court Case Over Alleged Embargo Breach Abandoned"],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Reinhart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"England","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"High Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakomoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UK Contempt of Court Case Over Alleged Embargo Breach Abandoned","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Magnus Granath","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$143 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ira Kleiman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$250,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Florida","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Craig Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 18","content":"DATE"},{"type":"July 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"David","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2008","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Palm Beach","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bruce Reinhart","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hodlonaut","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kleiman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Craig Wright","Satoshi Nakamoto","United States","Florida","Bitcoin"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
