Just ask Bitso.","The crypto exchange, which operates in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, is seeing solid growth from institutional clients craving stablecoins as a way to overcome the aforementioned challenges and deal in U.S. dollars.","\u201CThey want to have some exposure to dollars but instead of going to a bank and hedging with FX forwards, they buy stablecoins,\u201D Bitso\u2019s Brazil head, Thales Araújo de Freitas, said during an interview in Miami after speaking at the Fintech Nexus LatAm conference. \u201CEven with the winter, we keep seeing more interest from companies.\u201D","Latin American countries are frequently destabilized by politics and economies that are on shaky ground. Peru is in a state of emergency after the president tried to dissolve Congress and was subsequently impeached and arrested earlier this month. Argentina's annual inflation expanded more than 92% over the past 12 months while its black market currency weakened by some 55%. Meanwhile, Brazil's stock market is down more than 10% since its presidential runoff election saw leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva win in October. Its currency has weakened some 6.7% over the past year.","All of the chaos has presented opportunity for people and businesses seeking safe havens, either to hold their cash or convert it to alternative currencies.","Bitso already has more than 1,500 institutional clients, many of which have costs in U.S. dollars. Bitso has products in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina that allow for the seamless transfer of crypto to fiat accounts, and it\u2019s looking at building out something similar in Brazil, Freitas said.","\u201CIn Brazil, it\u2019s not very easy for a company to open a bank account overseas,\u201D he said. In particular, clients like Circle's USDC.","\u201CCircle, they have done a great job promoting their transparency, and it\u2019s become like a premium stablecoin,\u201D he said, noting that clients also trade other stablecoins including Dai and Tether. \u201CThe most important aspect right now is the liquidity.\"","Freitas said he expected stablecoin issuers to converge on a more conservative approach in terms of assets they hold to back the coins.","Amid the fallout surrounding the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, Freitas said there was still enthusiasm in Latin America from regulators.","\u201CLatin America, and Brazil in particular, we are ahead of the U.S. and other G7 countries,\u201D he said, pointing to the country\u2019s efforts around the creation of a central bank digital currency and a new crypto law approved by congress last month and waiting for the president's signature. \u201CIn Brazil, we have big banks trading crypto.\u201D","A digital real in Brazil could eventually be used by banks and fintechs for settlement amongst themselves and also as collateral for private stablecoins, he said.","The company currently has more than 1 million customers in Brazil, Freitas said, adding that he wanted growth to come from customers using multiple products. Cross-border travel in the region presents an especially promising opportunity.","\u201CA Brazilian can travel to Argentina and scan a QR code, and then you can pay using your crypto, and then you get the best exchange rate,\u201D he said.","The company recently launched operations in Colombia, which is currently the company\u2019s fastest-growing market.","\u201CThey\u2019re very enthusiastic about saving dollars,\u201D he said. \u201CThe use case of USD stable coins is huge in Colombia. They like new technologies, like Brazilians. It\u2019s a new market, so we have higher growth rates, but we have seen enthusiasm for stablecoins.\u201D","The company has not been immune to the industry downturn and last month made a round of fresh <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/190758\/bitso-cuts-more-staff-in-fresh-round-of-layoffs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">layoffs<\/a>. Freitas said the \"necessary\" cuts had been unfortunate, although in line with what has gone on elsewhere in the space.","\"Right now we have this winter, but we're confident the summer will come again,\" he said, adding that the company would be hiring for specific roles. \"We're still very bullish.\"","© 2023 The Block.
