Now, as traditional finance firms begin to deploy capital into crypto services, Coinbase sees itself at the forefront of facilitating that institutional adoption.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think we're moving away from the designation of Coinbase as an exchange to being a much more complex organization,\u201D said Coinbase's Greg Tusar, whose crypto brokerage startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/66479\/coinbase-tagomi-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tagomi<\/a> was acquired last year.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On this episode of The Scoop, Coinbase head of institutional sales Brett Tejpaul and head of institutional product Greg Tusar join for a discussion on Coinbase\u2019s pace of growth to meet client demand and how the company is building itself into a <\/span>full-scale prime broker.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe're focused more on the future of finance and DeFi,\u201D said Tejpaul of Coinbase's goal to combine its custodianship, exchange, brokerage and DeFi services for institutional clients. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He went on to say<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that they have filled out some 250 requests for proposals from clients to build crypto products for their firms. The longest such RFP is a whopping 800 questions long, according to Tejpaul.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CJust think through what it takes to, first of all, to answer 800 questions and think through how many people are working through and processing through that,\u201D said Tejpaul.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The execs also touched on Coinbase's role in growing retail interest in stablecoins and altcoins, citing how some 75% of clients own more than Bitcoin, 80% own some Ethereum and Tejpaul estimated that 50% of that group also own at least 5 or more cryptocurrencies. \u201CAnd all that's happened in the course of a year or so.\u201D Said Tejpaul.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase is growing its business with <\/span>direct investment, expanding its sales team from 7 to 60-odd people in less than half a year, Tejpaul noted. The company is also focusing on growing its product base by<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> creating a variety of familiar instruments for traditional finance institutions, which include <\/span>providing means for institutions to gain sub-custody, tap into stablecoin utility to leverage DeFi protocols, and by creating capabilities for DeFi, smart contracts, and NFTs for broad institutional participation.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Beyond that, as Coinbase pushes itself to evolve, demand expansion is evidently applying pressure to provide as many services as possible to a range of institutional clients by facilitating the creation and adoption of their own crypto offerings. According to the execs, this is fueling growth in institutional revenue.<\/span>","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
