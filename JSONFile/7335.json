Here, Kwon increased the initial token unlocks of allocations of LUNA 2.0 tokens from 15% to 30% \u2014 with the remaining 70% locked for a two-year vesting period.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s unusual for a proposal to be amended amid an on-chain vote. This is why today\u2019s changes from Kwon have led some to question its validity. Usually, whenever there is a change made to a proposal, it's done beforehand and not during the vote. FatMan, an anonymous Terra analyst and commentator, highlighted the fact that a new proposal should come with a fresh vote.<\/span>","\u201CHow can you make significant amendments to a proposal *mid-vote* when most people have already voted (for the original document)?,\u201D FatMan <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FatManTerra\/status\/1527541220553146368\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>. He added that \u201Csignificant changes should be posted as a brand new proposal.\u201D","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kwon\u2019s original proposal went to a validator vote on Wednesday. At the time of writing, a large majority of votes (80%) are in favor of it, with only 15% that are opposed to it with a veto. It's too early to say if the vote for Kwon\u2019s proposal will pass given there are five more days to go. If the \u2018no with veto\u2019 percentage crosses the 33.4% level, the entire proposal would be scrapped despite the fact it has majority support from validators.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
