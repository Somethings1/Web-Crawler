Meanwhile, DeFiance says that the assets should be treated separately and returned to its own investors.","Emerging from the shadows of its 3AC setbacks, DeFiance earlier this year raised a portion of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/219264\/defiance-capital-completes-first-close-of-100-million-liquid-token-fund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a new $100 million liquid token fund<\/a>.

The Rell smart contract language is \"very similar to SQL, just seven times more compact,\" he added.","Chromia is a project of ChromaWay, a Swedish blockchain startup founded in 2014, which initially developed an enterprise blockchain platform called Postchain. Chromia is based on the Postchain framework.","Even before Postchain, ChromaWay's founders \u2014 Perelman, Alex Mizrahi, Iddo Bentov, and Henrik Hjelte \u2014 built Colored Coins, an open-source protocol that allows issuing tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was also involved in the Colored Coins project before he worked on Ethereum.","Mizrahi, Perelman, and Hjelte then moved to found Chromia in 2018, and the network has been under development since then. Once launched, Chromia can be used as a Layer 1 or an Ethereum Layer 2 network, according to its website. Chromia expects to launch its mainnet next year.","Chromia's token CHR is already listed on top crypto exchanges, including Binance and Kraken. Currently, CHR is an ERC20 token, but when the Chromia mainnet is launched, there will be a transition from an ERC20 token to a native one, according to Chromia's website.","As Chromia's APAC head, Goh looks to grow its ecosystem by creating awareness of the project and attracting more developers and users to it, he said.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
