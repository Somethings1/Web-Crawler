This triggers the contract to \u201Cmint\u201D an asset of equivalent value on another blockchain (such as wETH on Solana). This wETH can always be returned to unlock the original ETH, thereby pegging its value to ETH.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:440,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That is, unless the bridge is hacked.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:440,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Why are cross-chain bridges so vulnerable?&nbsp;<\/strong>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bridges are an attractive target because they often centralize their storage of the locked funds that back the \u201Cbridged\u201D assets. Regardless of how those funds are secured \u2013 with a multisig wallet, a smart contract, or a third-party custodian \u2013 that storage center becomes a target.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Secure bridge design is an unresolved technical challenge, meaning that some of the bridges in operation today could still be exploited before best practices are defined.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What the industry can do&nbsp;<\/strong>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While not foolproof, an important first step toward addressing these issues is to make rigorous and recurring smart contract audits a DeFi-wide standard. Developers should coordinate with blockchain security and red teams to test their code before each release. Then, over time, the strongest designs can serve as templates for developers moving forward.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cryptocurrency services \u2013 not just bridges \u2013 should also consider investing in security measures and training. For North Korean-linked hackers, for example, social engineering is a favored attack vector, so teams should be taught to recognize the warning signs of a spear phishing attack.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Finally, if a service falls victim to a hack, time is of the essence.
