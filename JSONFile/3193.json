Reynolds claimed in the complaint that he was paid in the form of Binance Coin (BNB) as compensation during the period. According to the complaint, Reynolds continued to use Binance \"to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and continued to store digital currencies in his Binance account.\"&nbsp;","A search for Reynolds' Binance-related services indicates that he served as a \"team admin\" for a Binance community Slack channel, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/6u802a\/dnt_proof_of_binance_listing_by_steve_reynolds\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a Reddit post<\/a> from August 2017.

As the complaint states:","Edwards did not respond to a request for comment by press time.&nbsp;","When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Binance told The Block that Reynolds first worked as a volunteer community member (or \"angel\") before being formally hired as a community moderator in September 2017.","Binance confirmed that the relationship ended that December, and that \"as part of the termination closing procedure, we asked Steve to transfer ownership and admin control of all platforms and chat groups he was moderating for Binance.\" The representative alleged that Reynolds \"refused to transfer ownership or control of a 9000+ user Telegram chat group -- which was the main group we were using to provide customer support for our users at that time, 'Binance Support' (@binance_support) -- and insisted on renaming the group and keeping all of the users for his personal use, even after repeated communication from Binance.\"","The representative claimed that the request was made to avoid \"misrepresentation or possible abuse for unethical or illegal causes.\"","\"Steve refused and told us, 'I don\u2019t care',\" the representative said. \"He insisted on keeping the 9000+ users who joined the Binance Support Group for his personal and future use, and did not inform users of why the group name had changed or what its new purpose was. Steve then kicked out the Binance moderators from the misappropriated chat group,&nbsp;nullifying our efforts to warn and protect the users left in the group.\"","The representative went on to say:","The Binance representative also shared a chat conversation segment, during which Reynolds is seen saying that \"I'm not going to do that CZ, but I promise you that I will only ever have positive things to say about Binance.\"","\"Steve's last words with [Zhao] (on Jan 8, 2018) show that he had accepted that his account was locked and he understands the position,\" the representative said.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A full copy of the complaint can be found below:<\/em>","<a title=\"View Reynolds v.
