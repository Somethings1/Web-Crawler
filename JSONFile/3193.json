She launched Haun Ventures, which reportedly raised more than $1 billioin in assets, in 2022.&nbsp;","Haun said that an appeal of US District Judge Analisa Torres's decision is \"possible,\" but added that an \"immediate appeal seems unlikely both because the agency would have to ask the court to split this decision from the portion going to trial and because I am skeptical the SEC actually wants legal clarity.\"","To be clear, Ripple's battle with the SEC is far from over. Furthermore, Judge Torres also ruled that Ripple violated securities laws when it offloaded XRP to sophisticated institutional investors.&nbsp;","Still, a number of market participants noted the development could bode well for other crypto firms in their own ongoing legal proceedings, with investment banking giant JPMorgan noting it could benefit Coinbase.&nbsp;","\"The ruling appears on the surface to be a win for Coinbase in its recent lawsuit by the SEC,\" JPMorgan equity analysts led by Kenneth Worthington <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239775\/jpmorgan-ripple-xrp-coinbase\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a> in a report on Friday. \"We see Coinbase in the best position to benefit from the improved confidence and regulatory clarity given Coinbase's market-leading position and respected reputation in the industry.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
