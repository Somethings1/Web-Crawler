Moreover, a significant portion of this volume came from institutions.","Block trades, a privately negotiated purchase or sale of large blocks of digital assets settled over the counter (OTC), are typically made by institutions as they're useful for buying or selling vast amounts of cryptocurrencies without slippage affecting an asset\u2019s market price.","As institutions tend to use block trades, these are a useful indicator of institutional activity, which accounted for a significant portion of the trading volume leading up to The Merge.","While the price of ether has fallen since The Merge, the majority of derivatives volume trading occurred directly after the upgrade.&nbsp;","Block trades made up about 40% of v<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">olume post-Merge,<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> which was expected given that volatility fell Vidiella told The Block last week.
