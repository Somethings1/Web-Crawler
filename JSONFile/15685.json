Others promise extremely high yields or offer exclusive digital goods, as seen in NFT rug pulls.","Crypto rug pulls can also occur when the project\u2019s owners manipulate the value of a particular token or coin to deceive investors and subsequently siphon off their investments.","Fraudsters often attract victims with a sudden, sharp increase in the token\u2019s value in a short period. Once the price peaks, the people behind the token sell it to generate a profit while leaving \u201Cinvestors\u201D with steep losses.","Rug pulls often occur on decentralized trading platforms, enabling the fraudster to benefit from the pseudonymity of DEXes.","Rug pulls can generally be categorized into hard and soft rug pulls.","Hard rug pulls are more acute and sudden.

The hacker stole over $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency from Thodex users, and the exchange\u2019s founder, Faruk Özer, then disappeared. Özer was later arrested in Albania in 2022.","AnubisDAO was a DeFi project launched in 2021. The project promised high returns to investors, but it was a rug pull.
