As the crypto industry has ascended as a power player in Washington, DC, stakeholders\u2019 political work has attracted more attention.","The eminence of centralized players representing the decentralized world has proved a particular sticking point, sparking criticism during recent public \u2014 and televised \u2014 interactions.","Rep. Brad Sherman, one of the most vocal critics of crypto in Congress, derided a <a href=\"https:\/\/financialservices.house.gov\/events\/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=408705#LiveWebcast%20https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2021\/12\/08\/cryptocurrency-ceos-congress-regulation-523950\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">panel<\/a> of crypto CEOs in December.","\u201CThe advocates of crypto represent the powers in our society. The powers in our society \u2014 on Wall Street and in Washington have spent millions, and are trying to make billions or trillions in the crypto world,\u201D said Sherman. \u201CToday we hear from the CEOs, with their lobbyists, their PACs, and their power.\u201D","Many of the panelists run firms that have taken the lead on cryptocurrency lobbying and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/160663\/heres-how-crypto-linked-pacs-are-spending-in-tuesdays-primaries\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">campaign donations<\/a>. FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried was one of the biggest donors to Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign, while Coinbase \u2014 who sent CFO Alesia Haas rather than CEO Brian Armstrong \u2014 maintains the industry\u2019s largest lobbying program, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/159545\/led-by-exchanges-crypto-industry-lobbying-grew-17-in-q2-despite-bear-market\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dropping $1 million per quarter<\/a>.","At once, that investment in DC has opened the door to a massive increase in the industry\u2019s political viability. Yet with increasing entanglements, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/160714\/crypto-booster-michelle-bond-is-running-for-congress-with-help-from-her-ftx-exec-boyfriend\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ethical issues crop up<\/a>.","Non-profit Coin Center, for example, has long touted its dedication to decentralized networks as a distinction from trade associations like the Blockchain Association or the Chamber for Digital Commerce, which have to account for member companies. At the same time, many of those members are DeFi operators.","Firms like Uniswap Labs, the Stellar Development Foundation and the Celo Foundation have onboarded new teams to handle government relations.","Uniswap Labs and the Celo Foundation began reporting their first lobbying spending in the most recent quarter. Uniswap Labs hired Salman Banaei as head of policy in May. Both Stellar and Celo have dedicated internal lobbyists as well as outside contracts. Decentralized VPN developers Orchid Global began reporting lobbying in Q3 2021.","Those firms tout their distinctness from the protocols they program \u2014 that separation being a critical feature of DeFi. Seth Hertlein, who was the first registered lobbyist for the Stellar Development Foundation and who now works for Ledger, noted the distinction:","\u201CIt\u2019s an interesting dichotomy if you think about purely decentralized elements of the blockchain community versus centralized entities that are building things that are decentralized,\u201D says Seth Hertlein \u201CThe purely decentralized elements still haven\u2019t really figured out how to lobby, is my assessment.\u201D","For example, Uniswap is by far the largest decentralized exchange, with volumes comparable to centralized exchange Coinbase.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/dex-non-custodial\/uniswap-vs-coinbase-and-binance-trade-volume-7dma\/embed\" title=\"Uniswap vs. Coinbase and Binance Trade Volume (7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","It is, however, a protocol operating independent of the firm, Uniswap Labs \u2014 an argument Uniswap Labs\u2019 policy team has had to make before policymakers to ensure that the firm is not regulated as itself an exchange.","As one key piece of the puzzle, Uniswap Labs does not make money off of the platform\u2019s transaction fees. It is, however, funded by reserving 21% of the supply of native UNI tokens. The total market cap for UNI today is about $2.9 billion, according to CoinGecko data.&nbsp;","Still, just like a traditional tech company would, Uniswap needs someone familiar with the ways of Washington. As one barrier, the Federal Elections Commission tallies campaign donations. The Secretary of the Senate tracks lobbying disclosures. Hertlein continued:","\u201CTo be effective, especially with campaign finance and political giving, you really need a certain amount of centralization. You need someone running it who knows how Washington works. Then you need someone, some entity, some group that has a coherent vision of what they hope to accomplish.\u201D","In dollar terms, the biggest player in lobbying that sets the pace for DeFi-native is an offshoot of Uniswap. The DeFi Education Fund launched as a result of an on-chain Uniswap governance vote in July 2021, which allocated $20 million in UNI to the new political project.","The proposal established a new committee of seven members, including Uniswap\u2019s chief legal officer Marvin Ammori and legal reps of several other DeFi projects.","\u201CThis entity will not replicate the great work of existing organizations such as Coin Center, Fight for the Future, the Blockchain Association, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Defi Alliance, Blockchain for Europe, or others,\u201D the governance proposal <a href=\"https:\/\/gov.uniswap.org\/t\/governance-proposal-005-defi-education-fund\/12963\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">read<\/a>.","The DEF quickly onboarded Miller Whitehouse-Levine, formerly of the Blockchain Association, as its policy director. In Q4 of 2021, the DEF reported its first lobbying expenses, quickly becoming one of the largest spenders in crypto. The fund reported $230,000 in the most recent quarter.","\u201CDeFi\u2019s on the radar of the most important international regulators in the world,\u201D said Whitehouse-Levine. \u201CThere\u2019s an increasing recognition that regulators and developers are not speaking the same language right now.\u201D","\u201CIt is our hope that other DAOs will support policymaker education and advocacy efforts to help make the case for everyone to be able to develop and use DeFi protocols,\u201D Whitehouse-Levine continued. The organization\u2019s model has yet to attract imitators.","HODLPac is another project aiming to decentralize politics, particularly election donations. The political action committee\u2019s tagline is \u201CGrassroots politics for the decentralized economy.\u201D","Whirty launched HODLPac while an analyst at Takoma Group in early 2020. The core objective is to evolve into, effectively, a DAO.","The PAC distributes its receipts according to an endorsement panel of known figures in crypto, many with DC connections. But the endorsement scheme only unlocks matching donations from the SuperPAC; donors can allocate their funds to whatever candidates they please.","\u201CHODLPac\u2019s section of the market is really being the hard-money PAC,\u201D Tyler Whirty told The Block. It technically operates as a hybrid PAC and super PAC but has not actually used its super PAC wing this cycle.","For reference, PACs can donate $5,000 to a political candidate per election. Super PACs can spend unlimited funds in support of a campaign but are prohibited from coordinating with those campaigns.","In the cycle leading up to the 2022 midterms, the PAC had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fec.gov\/data\/committee\/C00733691\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> just under a quarter million dollars in total receipts. As of the end of June, it had given $46,191.47 to campaigns. Of total receipts, it actually returned a significant amount \u2014 over $130,000 \u2014 that had gone to its Super PAC.","For comparison, in its first year, HODLPac raised under $30,000 in total, only giving $7,500 to candidates. The current cycle represents a massive rise, and these numbers don\u2019t represent peak midterm campaigning season. However, they are still nowhere near the scale of spending that centralized entities in crypto have been able to field.","After losing the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries and a 2022 run for mayor of New York, Andrew Yang turned, in 2022, to Lobby3.","\u201CThe most profound opportunity to fight poverty lies in Web3 technologies. Unfortunately, our leaders in DC don\u2019t really get these technologies and are a little bit nervous about them,\u201D he said in a February 17 <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AndrewYang\/status\/1494295220023971845\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">video<\/a> announcing the project.","Lobby3 aimed to bring the virtues of Web3 to DC. At a July 22 <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lobby3_DAO\/status\/1550541443701227520\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">roundtable<\/a> conducted as a Twitter space, a representative described its ambition to become \u201Can impact-advocacy DAO.\u201D","Writing to The Block, community manager Renee Davis said of Lobby3\u2019s 2,500 members: \u201CThis community is the first that is focused specifically on giving individual Web3 builders a real voice in the burgeoning policy conversation \u2014 so that it's not just major industry players whose voices are being heard.\u201D","Yet from the public\u2019s vantage point, Lobby3 has largely fallen quiet.","Trading on membership NFTs in secondary markets has practically frozen over. At the end of July, the firm hosted a members-only Twitter Space. Fifteen people tuned in. The operation has reported no lobbying spending, no political donations nor any other open public work. Yang himself has not tweeted or blogged about it since announcing its launch.","While decentralizing political influence has its appeal, it remains in beta testing. And as with the broader world of funding in politics, the field is fraught.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
