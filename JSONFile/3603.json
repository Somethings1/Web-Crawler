Matt Spoke, co-founder and CEO of the OAN said building open apps on top of a blockchain can extend capabilities to mitigate some of these consequences by giving users \u201Csovereignty\u201D over their own data.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Users can hold their own data identity outside of the individual apps that collect certain data, meaning they can collect and leverage it for their own purposes. This could include using the data to better another project, such as reporting driving routes and times for a project looking to make traffic routes more efficient. Rather than a company selling user data, the OAN enables users to sell their data, according to Spoke.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This also enables a token economy, where users can be rewarded for favorable behavior when using an open app. Complementary apps could also use the same asset, creating an open economy, according to Spoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Transportation companies in particular are leveraging their data using blockchain. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.velocia.io\/#DataBlockchain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Velocia<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, an open app on the OAN, partnered with public transit partners including Citi Bike Miami, Miami-Dade County, Bolt and GetAround. Velocia is expanding throughout the Miami area, where users receive its VELOS token for utilizing public transportation, equating to rewards on other mobility apps.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CVelocia is probably the farthest along,\u201D said Spoke.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He referenced a growing video platform ecosystem as well, centered around a Latin American streaming service, as well as a Slack-like hub for developer communities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ultimately, the OAN is meant to add to existing platform economy giants rather than usurp them, according to Spoke. The solution to gripes with companies like Uber and Airbnb looks more like augmenting the user experience rather than abolishing the giants.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COur approach to market is let\u2019s build add-on components and features that can interact with Uber, or Airbnb, or Netflix, or whatever platform,\u201D he said. \u201CWhatever the concerns are depending on each market, take advantage of the fact that they have massive adoption and massive network effects.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Any features built to augment an existing platform are built on OAN rather than the existing platform.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This so-called \u201COpen Economy\u201D capability is currently available. The API will be publicly available later this year, with other integrations to come.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
