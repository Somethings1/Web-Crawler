It applied the BTC\/USD exchange rate at the time of each transaction for USD conversions.","\"To calculate this as a percentage of all BTC sent, we then needed to determine accurate figures for the USD value of BTC sent over time,\" said Elliptic.","","","\"There is a clear downward trend,\" Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist of Elliptic, told The Block. \"I think this is due to the introduction of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, the work of law enforcement, and the AML efforts of crypto exchanges and other businesses - as well as speculation emerging as the dominant use of crypto.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nElliptic did not share the USD value of illicit bitcoin transactions. Robinson said the firm is seeking to send a message specifically around the proportion linked to criminality. \"We think too much focus is paid to the absolute figures when people should be looking more at the larger context,\" he said.&nbsp;","It is also not clear what percentage of fiat currency transactions are linked to illicit activities. Robinson said bitcoin's blockchain is transparent, but it is \"very difficult\" to track fiat. \"I am not aware of any comparable figures to make a fair comparison,\" he said.","In 2018, Elliptic <a href=\"https:\/\/coincenter.org\/link\/a-new-study-finds-less-than-1-of-bitcoin-transactions-to-exchanges-are-illicit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">produced<\/a> a similar study to conclude that only 0.61% of bitcoin transactions were linked to illicit sources.
