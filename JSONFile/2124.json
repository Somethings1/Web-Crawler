Still, Gallagher didn\u2019t think the company could use that to trade the tokens named as unregistered securities by the SEC, including Solana, Polygon, and Cardano, in those two enforcement actions. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the lack of disclosures standard for other security investments from those projects would hinder re-listing them, Gallagher testified.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCompulsory disclosure in the digital asset space is missing,\u201D said Gallagher when asked how a retail investor could understand what they\u2019re buying when investing in crypto.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Industry witnesses, including Gallagher, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Christopher Giancarlo \u2014 who now is senior counsel at the law firm Willkie \u2014 and Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal sought to define exactly what should be disclosed for potential crypto investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSome investors want to look at quantitative measures, like discounted cash flows, some want to look at qualitative, like who\u2019s the management team, who formed this, in this instance, what does the coin do, what network is it on, is it stakeable?\u201D elaborated Gallagher. \u201CAll of these other features that might be important to it.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rep. John Duarte, R-Calif., sounded skeptical about how disclosures could work with crypto projects. Duarte compared crypto to special purpose acquisition companies, an unorthodox vehicle to publicly offer stock in recent years, that has also been the target of criticism over lack of disclosures and poor outcomes for retail investors.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSo we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re disclosing, but we\u2019re going to be disclosing something. It\u2019s not earnings, it\u2019s not business strategy, it\u2019s just something,\u201D said Duarte. \u201CWhat is your competitive advantage, what is your unique value proposition, what is your business strategy, what are you going to do better than what other companies aren\u2019t already doing, what resources do you have, what\u2019s your talent pool?\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI don\u2019t see how any of that fits into describing how we value a crypto asset,\u201D concluded Duarte.&nbsp;<\/span>","Later in the hearing, Giancarlo told the committee that he believed analysis firms like Chainalysis might be able to provide enough analysis for investors instead of financial disclosures being issued when new tokens are publicly offered.","\"There is no disclosure on coal or wheat or other commodities from a central party,\" said Giancarlo. \"They rely on third parties to provide a lot of that data set.\"","The former CFTC chair continued: \"We shouldn't have to use old forms&nbsp; to think that there should be somebody in the center that's issuing disclosure, there will be third parties stepping up to provide very good analysis that people investing in digital commodities will look to.\"","© 2023 The Block.
