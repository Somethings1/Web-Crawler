The upgrade encountered roadblocks, including a potential \u201Cchain split\u201D due to issues in clients\u2019 ability to sync with each other. Parithosh Jayanthi, DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/parithosh_j\/status\/1747564353467936817\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">confirmed<\/a> the Dencun fork on Goerli successfully finalized.","It's worth noting that client issues often arise on testnets during critical upgrades. Typically, client teams resolve synchronization bugs prior to the mainnet launch.&nbsp;","In preparation for this transition, the development team has opted for a phased approach \u2014 initially implementing the upgrade on various testnets.","Today it deployed on Goerli, the first testnet for the Dencun upgrade. The next implementation steps include Dencun's activation on the Sepolia testnet on Jan. 30, followed by the Holesky testnet on Feb. 7. The final mainnet release is expected by the end of the first quarter Q1 2024.","The central feature of this Dencun deployment (on Goerli) is the introduction of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eip4844.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EIP-4844<\/a> \u2014 a novel transaction mechanism known as ephemeral blobs or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189829\/ethereum-core-developers-signal-support-for-proto-danksharding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proto-danksharding<\/a>. This approach allows for the temporary storage and access of off-chain data by Ethereum nodes to reduce storage demands. It is expected to substantially lower transaction costs for Ethereum dApps, particularly benefiting Layer 2 rollup chains.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
