Wright, №18-CV-80176, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216417 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 27, 2018) [SDP]<\/strong><\/em>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.courtlistener.com\/docket\/6309656\/68\/kleiman-v-wright\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Link to opinion<\/a>","This opinion involves a lawsuit over ownership of more than a million bitcoin. (If like me you still think in dirty old fiat currency that\u2019s about 4 Billion Dollars at current exchange rates, or nearly 5 percent of the total 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist). It dives deep into esoteric questions of civil procedure, the mechanics of dispute resolution between parties in different countries, and a crypto-existential question that will be the primary focus of this summary: what is bitcoin for purposes of saying that someone stole yours? Is it money? Something else? And why does it matter?","First, some background. The dispute itself goes back to the early days of bitcoin and involves a fella named Craig Wright, who made news in recent years by claiming that he was the inventor of Bitcoin and then backing off of that claim not too long after. To say that Mr. Wright is controversial in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency circles would be an understatement.","Mr. Wright is the defendant in this lawsuit. There are two plaintiffs, the estate of David Kleiman and a company called W&amp;K Defense Research LLC (\u201CW &amp; K\u201D). Mr. Kleiman died in April 2013. The Court describes the relationship between Mr. Wright and Mr. Kleiman and the nubbin of the dispute as follows:","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dave and Craig met in or around 2003. Their relationship centered around their mutual interest in cyber security, digital forensics, and the future of money. Around 2008, Dave and Craig began to speak about ways to use peer-to-peer file sharing to solve issues in cryptography. The Amended Complaint alleges that for the next several years, Dave and Craig worked together in developing Bitcoin, and that through their collaboration they mined over a million bitcoins together. These bitcoins were stored in specifically identifiable bitcoin wallets, over which Craig now asserts ownership.<\/em>","The word \u201Cidentifiable\u201D is going to be key, as we will see below.","Plaintiffs allege that Dave Kleiman created intellectual property on his own and through W &amp; K and that the Estate and\/or W &amp; K own all of this IP. There is some dispute as to Mr. Wright\u2019s role in the creation of W &amp; K.","After Mr. Kleiman died, the Plaintiffs allege that Wright \u201Cunlawfully and without permission took control of the bitcoins from the Estate and from W&amp;K once he had exclusive possession over the private keys necessary to own, move, or sell the bitcoins belonging to Dave and\/or W&amp;K.\u201D","Because this post is called Crypto Caselaw Minute, not hour, I am going to skip over some really interesting back story involving Australian judgments and a long section of the opinion that deals with the doctrine of forum non convenience and something called international abstention. There\u2019s also some interesting dicta on forks, noting that the dispute actually involves not just the original bitcoin but forked stuff too (e.g., bitcoin cash I am looking at you). Summarizing this stuff quickly before I get to existential issues adverted to at the outset: the court dismissed a couple of claims for statute of limitations reasons but refused to dismiss this lawsuit entirely, so this FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BITCOIN LAWSUIT will continue.","One of the claims that is being allowed to continue is a claim for conversion. Conversion is an intentional tort\u200A\u2014\u200Aspecifically, it\u2019s a cause of action that you can bring against someone if they wrongly assert dominion over your property. Say that your neighbor Satoshi wrongfully takes your deckchairs\u200A\u2014\u200Ayou could sue him for conversion in order to recover the value of the chairs. That\u2019s right\u200A\u2014\u200Avalue of the chairs, not the chairs themselves. See, conversion is a legal remedy where you get damages. If you want to get the chairs themselves you\u2019d sue for detinue or a relative of that equitable cause of action, and get the court to order the chairs themselves to be returned.","It\u2019s usually hard to win on a claim for conversion of money because well, the stuff all looks the same\u200A\u2014\u200Ait\u2019s fungible. In order to succeed under Florida law, the Court says that you have to show \u201C(1) specific and identifiable money; (2) possession or an immediate right to possess that money; (3) an unauthorized act which deprives plaintiff of that money; and (4) a demand for return of the money and a refusal to do so.\u201D","Here, the court held that plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged a claim for conversion of bitcoin under Florida law:","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whether or not bitcoin is \u201Cmoney\u201D for the purposes of a conversion claim, the Court agrees with the Plaintiffs that they have sufficiently (and with specificity) alleged a claim for conversion. In regards to the bitcoin\u2019s specificity and identity, Plaintiffs have alleged that the bitcoin blockchain is \u201Ca giant ledger that tracks the ownership and transfer of every bitcoin in existence and that every [ bitcoin wallet and the number of bitcoin inside that particular wallet can be identified on the blockchain by referring to its \u201Cpublic key.\u201D Further Plaintiffs claim that the bitcoin at issue were \u201Cstored in specifically identifiable bitcoin wallets.\u201D Defendant also argues that Plaintiffs have failed to \u201Callege exactly how many bitcoins Dave Kleiman supposedly owned at any time in the past.\u201D Plaintiffs, however, have directly alleged that Defendant admitted that Dave owned at \u201Cleast 300,000 of the 1,000,000+ bitcoins allegedly held in trust.\u201D The Plaintiffs have also alleged that the bitcoins were transferred to trusts located in \u201CSeychelles, Singapore, and [the] UK.\u201D<\/em>","In short, the existential question of \u201Cwhat is bitcoin, really, man?\u201D looks like it didn\u2019t matter to this court. What mattered is that\u200A\u2014\u200Amoney or not\u200A\u2014\u200Ait could be identified with particularity. My friend Drew Hinkes (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/propelforward?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@propelforward<\/a> on twitter), who happens to be a Florida lawyer, pointed out to me that on this reasoning and under Florida law even if Bitcoin is money if you can identify the UTXO\u2019s, you can probably make out a claim for conversion. So \u2026 maybe it doesn\u2019t matter if bitcoin is or isn\u2019t money.","This lawsuit involves a substantial dispute and will be allowed to go forward. I\u2019m confident we will see more caselaw and more precedent from it. And when that happens you can be sure we\u2019ll cover here.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
