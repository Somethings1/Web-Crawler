The Monaco government recently <a href=\"https:\/\/wealthmonaco.com\/en\/monaco-votes-an-unprecedented-legislative-framework-for-cryptocurrency-fundraisers\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">passed<\/a> a bill that allows projects to fund themselves via issuing tokenized securities. The full regulatory framework is yet to be announced.","Tokeny CEO Luc Falempin told The Block that all issuers need to be approved by the government and get a visa to set up in Monaco. The projects must have an environmental, social and governance (ESG) focus, he added.","Since Tokeny is the government\u2019s selected partner, all projects would have to use its platform, said Falempin. \u201CTokeny will provide the digital services for issuers to enforce the control and compliance on the blockchain. We do this through our protocol, the T-REX. Essentially this protocol ensures only eligible investors are onboarded through automated compliance,\u201D said Falempin.","Tokeny will also provide issuers with an interface to onboard investors and manage their investors post issuance of securities. On the investors' side, the firm will provide a portal so they can manage their investments easily, said Falempin.","The first approved project to issue tokenized securities is production company IceBreaker Studios by French filmmaker Luc Jacquet.","Jacquet, whose documentary film March of the Penguins won an Oscar in 2015, said IceBreaker intends to leverage blockchain technology \u201Cto facilitate the financing of meaningful content production while retaining all associated rights enabling new monetization opportunities via films, exhibitions, etc.\u201D","\u201CMarch of the Penguins and the subsequent Antarctica exhibition have demonstrated that the model can be a profitable one making it appealing to investors while preserving the freedom to express my creativity and promoting the virtuous value of the projects I carry,\u201D Jacquet added.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe Monaco government will select 5 to 15 projects a year, said Falempin.
