Indeed, the aggregate open interest across the largest bitcoin futures markets has been increasing steadily from around $2 billion in mid-March to nearly $6 billion at last check.&nbsp;","Still, CME is unique given it is the largest derivatives market for U.S.-regulated trading shops and investors. Traders also say unique forces are driven open-interest to record highs.&nbsp;","Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Global Trading, told The Block that \"the juiciness of the basis\" is fueling open interest, referring to a trade that captures the spread between the underlying spot market and CME's bitcoin futures.&nbsp;","\"The futures are trading way above spot so people are selling it vs buying spot,\" said Lim. Genesis, which launched its derivatives desk in June, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/73893\/genesis-lending-surge-trading-yield\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> the desk saw $400 million worth of volume in its first month.&nbsp;","","","A trading executive at another crypto trading firm said that the basis trade was \"definitely driving some of it.\"&nbsp;The person added that the firm has seen a \"general uptick in institutional interest around bitcoin.\"","Most of those firms are expressing their interest in CME futures before spot \"based on the familiarity and ease of access.\"","© 2023 The Block.
