The exchange's&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/19\/binance-us-to-buy-voyager-digitals-assets-for-1-billion\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">winning bid<\/a> of $1 billion beat other industry players such as CrossTower and Wave Financial. The acquisition is still subject to regulatory approval, however.","The SEC objects to the debtor's plans to sell crypto assets as part of its rebalancing plan and has concerns about the security of assets on Binance.US's platform.","\"Here, the transactions in crypto assets necessary to effectuate the rebalancing, the re-distribution of such assets to account holders, may violate the prohibition in Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 against the unregistered offer, sale, or delivery after sale of securities,\" said Therese Scheuer, senior trial counsel at the SEC, in the filing.","The regulator also raised concerns over whether Voyager could demonstrate that it complies with federal laws with this plan, questioned whether the acquisition is \"just a $20 million sale of Voyager\u2019s customer list to Binance.US\" and also said the plan did not include adequate detail on the impact of potential regulatory action on the purchaser, Binance.US.&nbsp;","\"Regulatory actions, whether involving Voyager, Binance.US or both, could render the transactions in the plan impossible to consummate, thus making the plan unfeasible,\" said Scheuer in the filing.","Meanwhile, the NYDFS&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/cases.stretto.com\/public\/x193\/11753\/PLEADINGS\/1175302222380000000174.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">alleges<\/a> the current plan \u201Cunfairly discriminates\u201D against New Yorkers by delaying their recovery of assets compared to other creditors within the same class and criticized Voyager for illegally operating in the state of New York.","\"Even putting aside for the moment the debtors\u2019 past violations of law, the debtors\u2019 plan as proposed unfairly discriminates against these New Yorkers by materially delaying their recovery compared to creditors in the same class and by not allowing them the option to recover cryptocurrency instead of liquidated assets,\" said Kevin Puvalowski, acting executive deputy superintendent for NYDFS, in the filing.","This isn't the first time the regulators have pushed back on the deal.
