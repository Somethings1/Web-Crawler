FTX didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.","Now that Alameda, which shut up shop in November as its sister firm FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, is out of the picture, Palmstierna said valuations for crypto venture capital deals are starting to fall.","\u201CNow is an opportunity to actually deploy capital if you really believe in the space,\u201D he said. \u201CThere is a lot of assets which are now looking at very good value. Which means that it might not be a VC, it might be a follow-on type investment.\u201D","Founded in 2013 by former Goldman Sachs executives Rich Rosenblum and Cristian Gil, GSR is one of the oldest market makers in crypto. The firm offers services from over-the-counter trading to risk management and also has been very active in crypto VC this year, with 29 deals in the first quarter alone, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/mapping-out-gsr-portfolio-145824\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to<\/a> The Block Research.","Donning his VC hat, Palmstierna listed a few areas where he\u2019s particularly excited to invest at the moment: zero-knowledge proofs; decentralized options trading; lending protocols; and decentralized insurance, which he said has huge potential in underserved emerging markets in particular.","Still, despite these bright points and the recent removal of a large rival, Palmstierna acknowledged that the world of crypto investing faces a challenging time.","For one thing, rising interest rates make the returns on safe assets like U.S. Treasury bonds more enticing, leaving less investor cash to go around for alternative investments like crypto and venture capital.","\u201CCapital is more expensive. LP capital is already harder to access,\u201D Palmstierna lamented, referring to limited partners, the name given to those who invest in VC firms. \u201CIt's a much tougher environment for funds to raise.\u201D","Even before FTX and Alameda blew up, the firm, which has about 300 employees across&nbsp;offices in London, New Jersey, Singapore, Malaga and Zug, had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/176342\/market-maker-gsr-lays-off-staff-following-rapid-expansion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced plans<\/a> to cut headcount by 10% in October.","Despite these headwinds, GSR still felt able to contribute to a $1 billion crypto industry recovery fund <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186597\/binance-will-launch-a-new-industry-recovery-fund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">spearheaded<\/a> by exchange giant Binance that will \u2014 in the words of Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao \u2014 \u201Chelp projects who are otherwise strong, but in a liquidity crisis.\u201D","Palmstierna expanded on the practical workings of the recovery fund, which Binance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/blog\/ecosystem\/web3-leaders-join-binance-to-spearhead-web3-industry-recovery-initiative-5285759314040744618\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">insists<\/a> is \u201Cnot an investment fund.\u201D","Firms like GSR that pay into the fund aren\u2019t handing Binance their assets, he said. Instead, the separate contributors&nbsp; \u2014 who also include Jump Crypto, Polygon Ventures and Aptos Labs \u2014 will make separate decisions on which struggling projects to support.","\u201CThere is coordination of what we look at and then people make their own individual decisions,\u201D he said. \u201CGSR might support something that Binance doesn't or it might support something that GSR doesn't \u2014 or we might both support something together.\u201D","The pool of money, to which GSR has <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GSR_io\/status\/1598269564584091650\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">contributed<\/a> an initial $5 million, is not an investment fund because it isn\u2019t going to look for newly created projects to back, according to Palmstierna. Its main aim will instead be to \u201Cresurrect\u201D technologies that have been \u201Cunfairly treated by the current downfall.\u201D","That said, investors will expect to receive something in return for their cash, and the ways the capital is deployed are likely to \u201Cevolve over time.\u201D","\u201CYou don't just give away the money. You probably get something for it.\u201D he said.","Yet amid all the noise of a tumultuous 2022 \u2014 which has seen Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin collapse, the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital implode and now FTX leave more than a million creditors out of pocket \u2014 GSR\u2019s CEO is plotting a steady course.&nbsp;","\u201CThe opportunity for someone like GSR is to continue operating like we are doing and being transparent and providing liquidity across exchanges \u2014 centralized, decentralized and for token issuers \u2014 because without it, the networks don't work,\u201D Palmstierna said. \u201CFirst, you stabilize the markets and then you continue to build on the franchise.\u201D"],"hashtag":["INVESTMENT FIRMS"]}
