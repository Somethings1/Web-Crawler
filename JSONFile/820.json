The scam underscores the vulnerability users face, especially in regions like China, where direct downloads are a substitute for unavailable official app stores, SlowMist said in its <a href=\"https:\/\/slowmist.medium.com\/fake-skype-app-phishing-analysis-35c1dc8bc515\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a>.","\u201CDue to the inaccessibility of Google Play in China, many users often resort to searching for and downloading apps directly from the internet,\u201D SlowMist wrote. \u201CHowever, the types of fake apps available online are not limited to just wallets and exchanges. Social media applications like Telegram, WhatsApp and Skype are also heavily targeted.\u201D","SlowMist\u2019s subsequent investigation revealed several red flags, with the app's certificate effective date hinting it was newly created in September and signature information pointing toward Chinese origin. A Baidu search found multiple sources of the fake app consistent with the one provided by the victim, SlowMist noted.","The fake Skype app, camouflaged as the genuine video chat tool and injected with malicious code, monitors for and uploads files and images from users' devices in a bid to capture sensitive information.","Since apps like Skype are used to transfer files and make calls, users don\u2019t usually suspect the activity, SlowMist said \u2014 enabling the attackers to obtain user permissions to upload the files, as well as device information, user IDs and phone numbers.","More specifically, the fake Skype app monitors incoming and outgoing messages to see if they contain Ethereum or Tron blockchain addresses. If detected, these are replaced with hardcoded and dynamic malicious addresses by the attackers, SlowMist said, in an attempt to route any payments to themselves instead.","The SlowMist team found one of the malicious Tron addresses used had received nearly 200,000 USDT ($200,000) over 110 deposit transactions, most recently on Nov. 8. It also identified an Ethereum address that received 7,800 USDT in 10 transactions that were transferred out using BitKeep\u2019s swap service, with the transaction fees sourced from OKX.","However, the phishing interface\u2019s backend has now been shut down and no longer returns malicious addresses, SlowMist noted.","Notably, the phishing domain linked to the app initially impersonated the crypto exchange Binance before switching to mimic Skype's backend in May. A series of fake domains using the format \u201Cbn-download[number].com\u201D have specifically been used for <a href=\"https:\/\/slowmist.medium.com\/fake-airdrops-fake-wallets-and-now-fake-exchange-apps-ddb78f770f73\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance fake app phishing attacks<\/a>, indicating the group's general focus on the lucrative web3 sector, SlowMist said.","SlowMist advised users to use official app download channels only and enhance their security awareness to mitigate the risk of falling victim to such phishing attacks.","Â© 2023 The Block.
