First-generation stablecoins such as USDT (Tether) and USDC have largely filled this role. But along the way, we have seen several creative spins on stablecoin utility \u2013 extending beyond payments to trading and earning yield.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Unfortunately, some of the recent issues surrounding the adoption of stablecoins such as UST have led to distrust around the future viability of stablecoins.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But UST\u2019s downfall does not mean that stablecoins should not exist for the purpose of earning yield. In fact, second-generation stablecoins are expected to maintain stability while providing additional value, such as earning interest. In light of this reality, the question remains: how does a stablecoin achieve greater adoption without utilizing unsustainable growth mechanisms? CoinFLEX has designed the flexUSD stablecoin with this in mind, by capitalizing on the growth of crypto derivatives.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What do sustainable stablecoin yields have to do with crypto derivatives?<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinFLEX is the first crypto exchange to create a peer-to-peer repo (borrowing and lending) market, connecting dollar lenders (repo buyers) with crypto-collateralized borrowers (repo sellers). Repo sellers receive USDC in exchange for their coins, and retain their crypto exposure via the deliverable long perpetual futures leg. Repo market participants include basis traders (arbitraging or speculating on the price difference between a perpetual future and spot), lenders, borrowers, and cross-exchange arbitrageurs.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Understanding that many of these crypto activities are challenging to manage manually, CoinFLEX created flexUSD to tokenize these market opportunities. flexUSD takes advantage of the large demand for institutional levels of leverage and scarcity of dollars in the crypto markets, by earning funding rates from traders on the CoinFLEX exchange. flexUSD pays this interest to holders on-chain every 8 hours. It\u2019s important to note that because flexUSD sources this yield directly from the CoinFLEX futures markets rather than third-party intermediaries, <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the stablecoin earns transparent and sustainable yields for holders.<\/b>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With this in mind, let\u2019s take a step back and understand how flexUSD maintains its promise of stability.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Stablecoin Trifecta<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s helpful to have a framework for assessing the resiliency of stablecoins, namely focusing on the following properties:<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stability<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> \u2013 What is the stablecoin\u2019s depegging risk?<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">flexUSD is backed by USDC and coin assets in CoinFLEX\u2019s repo markets.
