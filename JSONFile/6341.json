The department said it considers a \u201Crange of potential risks\u201D before it authorizes the issuance of a stablecoin.&nbsp;<\/span>","New York's new policies come in the wake of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/146444\/terra-luna-and-ust-how-we-got-here\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the collapse of the popular stablecoin TerraUSD<\/a> last month.
