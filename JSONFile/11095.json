The warrant was issued by the&nbsp;Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office's Joint Investigation Team on Financial Securities Crimes (led by director Dan Sung-han) and 2nd Division of Financial Investigation (led by chief prosecutor Chae Hee-man), according to the report.&nbsp;","Kwon is currently believed to reside in Singapore, per the report, which stated that there have also been warrants issued for the arrest of Nicholas Platias, another of Terraform Labs\u2019 founders, and Han Mo, another employee.
