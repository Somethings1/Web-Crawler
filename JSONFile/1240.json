The startup employs more than 2,200 people globally.","But staff at Revolut have expressed concern over the new structure because of up-front fees of £1.95 and a \u201Churdle rate\u201D \u2013 the price at which the growth shares can be converted into normal shares \u2013 of £91 per share. Revolut is offering staff interest-free loans to cover the cost of the up-front fees.&nbsp;","The growth shares will be subject to a lower rate of tax because of the hurdle. In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bdo.co.uk\/en-gb\/insights\/tax\/global-employer-services\/growth-share-plan\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a blog post<\/a> on growth shares, the accountancy firm BDO explained that any increase in share value under such schemes is \u201Csubject to Capital Gains Tax which is more attractive than income tax.\u201D The firm added that growth shares offer a \u201Csignificant benefit\u201D to staff in high-growth firms.","The key point, however, is that the £91 per share hurdle rate is the same price paid by investors in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/24\/revolut-extends-series-d-round-to-580-million-with-80-million-in-new-funding\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Revolut\u2019s $580 million fundraise<\/a> last year, which valued the startup at $5.5 billion.","In other words, for staff to profit from their bonuses, Revolut would need to go public or be sold at a price far enough in excess of $5.5 billion that the pay-out also covers the up-front cost of purchasing the growth shares and Capital Gains Tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;","It's possible that staff could lose money on their bonuses \u2013 although it should be noted that Revolut boss Nikolay Storonsky has previously said he would not take the business public until it had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fnlondon.com\/articles\/revolut-chief-eyes-20bn-valuation-before-any-ipo-20190621\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">achieved a valuation of at least $20 billion<\/a>.","\u201CWe\u2019re aiming to give people a long-term incentive,\u201D said a Revolut spokesperson. \u201CAny long-term incentive is aimed at rewarding people for the future growth of the company and involving them in the future growth of the company.\u201D","The introduction of the growth shares is the latest twist in a ten-month struggle to find the right incentivization program for employees.","At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Revolut tried to cut costs by offering staff the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fnlondon.com\/articles\/revolut-offers-salary-swap-scheme-as-founders-waive-pay-amid-covid-19-crisis-20200415\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">chance to swap part of their salary<\/a> for share options on a two-for-one basis, meaning £1 of salary could be exchanged for £2 in share options.","But the digital bank ran into difficulty in October when HMRC, the UK tax authority, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fnlondon.com\/articles\/taxman-hikes-price-of-revolut-shares-by-more-than-one-hundred-times-20201005\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hiked the price of shares<\/a> issued under Revolut's current share option scheme by more than one hundred times \u2013 making it more costly for staff to convert their options into equity.","Revolut tried to solve that issue with the launch of an \u201Cunapproved share scheme\u201D, allowing companies to set a nominal conversion price, but which also requires staff who exercise their options to pay income tax.","But Revolut\u2019s spokesperson said the firm wanted \u201Cto find a way that enables people to be rewarded and doesn\u2019t expose to them high levels of tax.\u201D","The introduction of the growth shares plan is the culmination of a project carried out by EY, the consultancy. Revolut held an online session with EY advisers on February 15, allowing staff to ask questions about the scheme."],"hashtag":["FINTECH"]}
