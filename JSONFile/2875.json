The company has asked the court for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and an expedited trial.","Following the publication of this report, Ripple addressed the legal filing in a statement posted to its website, <a href=\"https:\/\/ripple.com\/ripple-press\/ripples-statement-on-yesterdays-tetragon-filing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stating<\/a>:","\u201CIn Ripple\u2019s Series C investment agreement, there is a provision that if XRP is deemed to be a security on a go forward basis, then Tetragon has the option of having Ripple redeem their Ripple equity. Since there has been no such determination, this lawsuit has no merit. We are disappointed that Tetragon is seeking to unfairly take advantage of the lack of regulatory clarity here in the U.S. The courts will provide this clarity and we are very confident in our position.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
