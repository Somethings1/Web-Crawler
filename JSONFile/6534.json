It was officially founded in January 2018 and became profitable in the second month of its operation, Amber co-founder Tiantian Kullander told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The firm offers so-called integrated secondary market services, tying market-making, over-the-counter (OTC) trading, electronic sales trading, lending, treasury management, and other trading services for institutional investors under one roof. Within half a year, the firm has generated $100 million in loans \u2013 and is currently sitting on $60 million outstanding loans as of today with 150% in quarterly growth, according to Kullander.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As a point of reference, Asia-based Matrixport <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/54000\/500-million-in-crypto-spot-trades-in-less-than-a-year-a-deep-dive-into-the-rise-of-jihan-wus-matrixport\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">had around $100 million<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in outstanding loans by January 2020, and that firm inherited one of the best miner client networks from its founder Jihan Wu, who currently helms mining equipment maker Bitmain.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMore and more of these services, they are very synergistic with each other, and hence whilst we can break them down into different business lines now, and track revenue separately, overtime the revenue will be commingled,\u201D said Kullander.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Compared to Matrixport and Genesis Global Trading \u2013 both of which have ties with notable firms in the institutional lending space,&nbsp;Bitmain and Digital Currency Group, respectively \u2013 Amber may still hold an edge as its active presence in trading allows them to offer competitive interest rate, Kullander argued.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe reason why we feel like we have a strong edge in lending, even though we don't have as big of a balance sheet\u2026 is because we are also very active in trading interest rate in the market,\u201D said Kullander.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Amber also finds itself in a unique spot in the crypto venture investment scene, wherein there are not a lot of middle-stage startups with clear business models and revenue-generating capacity with which VCs can entrust their investments.&nbsp;<\/span>","\"As market liquidity further bifurcates among sophisticated dealers and client-facing broker in a fully electronic market, Amber plays a huge rule by enabling clients to trade across fragmented crypto markets through a single software interface,\" Arjun Balaji, an investment partner at Paradigm, told The Block. \"We led Amber\u2019s Series A because we believe Amber is well-positioned to capture this opportunity.
