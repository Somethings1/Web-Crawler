This key is usually encrypted with a password set by the user, Ching said. Forgetting this password means losing access to the wallet unless the key is stored elsewhere. However, with a passkey, logging in becomes possible without passwords, typically through Touch ID or Face ID.","Passkeys are more user-friendly and mirror the ease of use found in services like Apple Pay or Google Pay, Ching said.","\"Users will be able to store the private key for a passkey account directly on their device and sync their private key with their backup provider (e.g., iCloud or Google Password Manager). Then, when they want to sign a transaction, they can use the passkey directly to do so, rather than sending the request to a service to be signed,\" he added.","Other crypto projects, like Dynamic Wallet and Turnkey, also provide passkey authentication. However, in contrast to Aptos' system where users store their private key on their device, Dynamic Wallet and Turnkey keep the private key on systems such as Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclave, Ching said.","Aptos built its passkey authenticator in-house after ideating on it in early 2023, Ching said. While the authenticator is currently only implemented for the Aptos ecosystem, others could use it as it is open-sourced, Ching added. Aptos has utilized the WebAuthn standard and public-key cryptography for the authenticator.","Aptos Labs, backed by high-profile venture capital firms, launched its blockchain in October 2022.
