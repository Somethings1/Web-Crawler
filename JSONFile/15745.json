Its business-facing network of application programming interfaces (APIs) for know-your-customer (KYC) checks, trading, debit card issuance, retail settlement and crypto on- and off-ramps gets pinged 300 million times a month, he said.","With clients including FTX, Binance.US, Securitize, Dapper and Kraken, Prime Trust gets exposure to some of crypto\u2019s hottest corners, everything from derivatives trading to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).","Businesses can pick and choose which APIs to plug into depending on their needs. Vicuna said it saves them time while increasing Prime Trust\u2019s footprint in the fast-growing ecosystem.","\u201CYou can think of us as the best indicator of adoption within the market,\u201D Vicuna said, \u201Cbecause we are so widely spread out across different segments via crypto exchanges-on ramps, wealth apps, lending platforms and more.\u201D","Much of the action flows through in fiat.

That\u2019s up 40% from Prime Trust\u2019s last reported totals.","The booming figures follow Prime Trust\u2019s $64 million Series A in July. It\u2019s since doubled headcount to \u201Cthe couple hundreds\u201D \u2013 Vicuna declined to provide specifics \u2013 and doubled-down on marketing after realizing \u201Cword of mouth\u201D alone was not aggressive enough.","Read more: Prime Trust Raises $64M to Scale Fintech Infrastructure Biz","Compliance has been a key growth area, Vicuna said. Nearly half the company is dedicated to policing its business endeavors. They also \u201Csell compliance as a service\u201D to market players, alongside their other offerings.","As for the company\u2019s own growth, Vicuna predicted a busy 2022. He cast doubt that this year\u2019s massive influx of venture capital across the space could continue its breakneck pace through another 12 months and predicted the market \u201Cwill return a little bit to fundamentals.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"$64 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Las Vegas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chief Financial Officer Rodrigo Vicuna","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Scale Fintech Infrastructure Biz","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2,000%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Vicuna","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$64M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Prime Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Prime Trust","APIs"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
