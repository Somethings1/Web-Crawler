Neon's implementation is a smart contract built on top of Solana to deploy Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) code \u2014 something that\u2019s not been possible so far on the network.&nbsp;","The development team announced the completion of the necessary tooling for Ethereum developers to transition their projects to Solana, a move, it said, could potentially reduce the operational costs of their applications.","It expressed confidence that its EVM solution will integrate effectively with Solana\u2019s high throughput capabilities to host Ethereum apps, and is currently conducting extensive tests in this regard.","In addition to providing access to the Solana network, Neon EVM hopes to enable Ethereum apps to take advantage of the functionality native to Solana, including parallel execution of transactions.","\u201CWe are very excited to see Neon EVM live on Solana Mainnet,\u201D said Marina Guryeva, director of Neon Foundation. \u201COnce we repeat these tests in production, we will present the figures based on the real-world data.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
