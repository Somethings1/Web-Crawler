But, the paper argues (referencing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paradigm.xyz\/2021\/04\/understanding-automated-market-makers-part-1-price-impact\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">this article<\/a>) that these are inefficient and expensive for large trades.","Instead, it proposes a technique used in traditional finance: splitting orders up into many smaller pieces and executing them over a given timeframe.","\u201CIt breaks long-term orders into infinitely many infinitely small pieces and executes them smoothly against its embedded AMM over time,\u201D tweeted White.","One key issue here is transaction fees. Every Ethereum transaction has to pay a transaction fee and these can be quite expensive, particularly for complex transactions like ones typically used by DEXs. White said, however, that this proposal manages to execute the trades in a way that\u2019s efficient for transaction fees (using some \u201Clucky math\u201D).","But the idea is still in its early stages. White added: \u201CWe've sketched out the design of the TWAMM, but our work is just beginning.\u201D He called for further developers to join them in working on this particular project.","Â© 2023 The Block.
