Beyond this period, the court will issue a final mandate and further directives. \"We don\u2019t know what the final opinion will say until we reach the end of that period,\" Sonnenshein added.","Following the ruling, the SEC can either approve the conversion of GBTC into an ETF, deny it for some other reason or force the closure of existing futures-based bitcoin ETFs, according to The ETF Store President Nathan Geraci.&nbsp;The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is a digital asset investment product that individual investors can buy and sell in their brokerage accounts.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247959\/grayscale-bitcoin-trust-discount-shrinks-after-legal-victory\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">GBTC discount to net asset value narrowed from -25% to -17%<\/a>, while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247947\/bitcoin-price-soars-after-grayscale-win-in-dispute-with-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin's value surged by 5.4% to $27,450 immediately following the court's decision<\/a>.

However, Sonnenshein reiterated that the company is \u201Ccommitted to lowering fees when GBTC converts to an ETF.\u201D","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/structured-products\/premium-of-gbtc\/embed\" title=\"Daily GBTC Premium\/Discount to NAV\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","&nbsp;","Grayscale\u2019s legal victory could also have broader implications for pending spot bitcoin ETF applications.","Upcoming deadlines for the SEC\u2019s decision to approve, reject or delay proposals from BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie fall from Sept. 1 to Sept. 4.
