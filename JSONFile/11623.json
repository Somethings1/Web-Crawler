Voyager argued those employees' compensation has changed in recent months as their equity depreciated.","\"The departure of the Debtors\u2019 key employees during these chapter 11 cases would destroy value, harm the Debtors\u2019 restructuring process, and adversely affect the Debtors\u2019 ability to operate in the ordinary course upon emergence,\" said Voyager in its request for the funds.","Those cash rewards would cap at $1.9 million to 38 non-insiders performing essential accounting, cash and digital asset management, IT infrastructure, legal, and other critical functions.

The names of those receiving the payout will also be sealed per a companion order.&nbsp;","During that hearing, Voyager counsel confirmed no senior management positions counted among the employees receiving the retention money.&nbsp;","Voyager <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/155990\/crypto-broker-voyager-digital-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">entered<\/a> Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in early July after halting activity on its platform.
