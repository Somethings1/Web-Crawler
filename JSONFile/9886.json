It claimed that it will also generate an estimated 3% yield for MakerDAO.<\/span>","As indicated by the vote, the large majority of the DAO's delegates supported the deal. ACREinvest, a delegate who voted yes during the vote <a href=\"https:\/\/vote.makerdao.com\/polling\/QmQMDasC#comments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">commented<\/a> that \"the innovation [following the deal] here will open the floodgates for others to imagine what's possible outside of TradFi.\"","However, not all delegates were happy with the idea of a decentralized stablecoin working with traditional finance entities. Chris Blec, the founder of DeFi Watch, was the largest Maker delegate voting against the proposal. He voted no with 4,218 MKR tokens (3.1% of voting power). Blec voiced concerns regarding regulatory risks that come with this deal.","\"There is an existential risk that any of these third party deals pose to MakerDAO in the context of today's regulatory climate. What if a regulator forces this bank to freeze everything, sever ties with the DAO and take all the money?\" Blec told The Block.","DAI was originally founded in 2017 as a decentralized stablecoin backed with ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain. In November 2019, MakerDAO migrated to new system, allowing multiple on-chain crypto collaterals to back DAI.","In the last one year, MakerDAO has pivoted to a strategy of diversifying its treasury into real-world assets (RWAs). Just recently, MakerDAO passed a vote to invest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/154515\/maker-governance-is-voting-to-invest-500-million-in-us-treasury-bills\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$500 million<\/a> into short-term US treasury bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds.","© 2023 The Block.
