In May 2021, only 700 DAOs were operational. Today there are more than 6,000.","Simon Yu the CEO and co-founder of StormX. This article is part of \u201CFuture of Work Week.\u201D","Bringing DAOs into the mainstream is complicated, especially in a nascent crypto environment where people are often more committed to making a buck than building sustainable companies. Consequently, many brands and companies aren't in a position to fully decentralize their corporate structure, eliminate titles and put all decisions in the hands of a decentralized community of pseudonymous members.","Every company, however, can implement a hybrid DAO model that gives customers a greater voice, increasing engagement and putting brands in a position to thrive in a decentralized future.","DAOs offer a unique learning experience for brands preparing for the inevitable rise of the metaverse and other blockchain-based business elements. The main goal as always is to find realistic and durable ways to increase engagement from their consumer base.","For starters, customer engagement is critical to bottom-line outcomes.

Ultimately, it\u2019s about allowing customers to propose and vote on various product or service features.","For instance, brands can distribute a product road map poll, letting stakeholders weigh in on the most important feature enhancements and new capabilities. This delivers the voice of the customer directly to product development teams, which can simultaneously enhance customer sentiment and brand maturation.","Similarly, brands can embrace a DAO ethos by engaging stakeholders on:","When brands give customers more of a voice, they foster an avid following of loyal customers who are highly invested in the future of the brand\/product because they are contributing to elements of decision making.","Simply put, insights into customer demands and desires help brands to be more successful in delivering what people actually want. Crowdsourcing ideas can lead to even stronger end results when it comes to changes to products, branding, design and more.","In other words, brands can benefit from the wisdom of the crowd.","Read more: How I Made It: From Pro Baller to Master of DAOs","Brands and companies that adopt a hybrid DAO model will create a shift from thinking of buyers as \"customers\" to thinking of them as team members and part of their community. This shift in brand mindset could have greater repercussions for business culture and structure than can be fully anticipated.","Ultimately, the rise of the metaverse and Web3 will favor brands that adopt this type of model over those that do not, making a hybrid DAO model a multifaceted competitive differentiator that can set brands apart from the competition both now and in the years ahead.","It may be a bear market, but there are still plenty of jobs to be had at crypto companies.","Meet the pioneers who work at decentralized autonomous organizations.","It may be a bear market, but there are still plenty of jobs to be had at crypto companies."],"entity":[{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"corp","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Future of Work Week","Opinion","DAO","Governance"],"authors":["Simon Yu"]}
