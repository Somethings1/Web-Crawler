It aims to simplify the movement of Ondo tokens representing real-world assets, such as the recently introduced yield-bearing stablecoin USDY, across different blockchain networks.","\u201CDemand for better stablecoins is growing \u2013 and it isn\u2019t limited to a single web3 ecosystem,\u201D said Nathan Allman, founder and CEO of Ondo. \u201CThe Ondo Bridge enables us to meet that demand wherever it exists, with a superior and safer yield-generating stablecoin.\u201D","Ondo\u2019s first core products are tokenized cash equivalents that deliver yield backed by assets like U.S. treasuries, money market funds and similar instruments. The objective is to offer users alternative to stablecoins where holders rather than issuers earn the majority of the underlying asset yield.","Ondo Finance tops the tokenized securities niche with approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/steakhouse\/tokenized-securities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">50% market share<\/a>, according to a Steakhouse Financial Dune Analytics dashboard, and has legally structured USDY as a tokenized bearer instrument. Ondo has over <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/ondo-finance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$200 million<\/a> in total value locked, according to DeFiLlama.","In this context, Axelar\u2019s programmable cross-chain network will allow Ondo to manage USDY supply across chains, burning tokenized representations of its real-world assets on one chain to mint them on another. The initial deployment will rely on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/250242\/squid-unveils-direct-swaps-across-cosmos-and-evm-blockchains\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Squid<\/a>, a cross-chain liquidity router built on Axelar, to transfer USDY between some chain pairs, including Mantle.","This integration ensures that tokens transferred between networks remain native, using a \u201Cburn-and-mint\u201D mechanism to avoid bridging risks associated with wrapped assets, according to the team. Additionally, the integration will enable unified secondary market liquidity, allowing traders to capitalize on token price arbitrage across various decentralized exchanges, maintaining price stability.","Â© 2023 The Block.
