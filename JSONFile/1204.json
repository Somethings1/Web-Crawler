The fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is the only asset out there that has a solid narrative, one that hasn\u2019t changed. Ethereum still doesn\u2019t match Bitcoin because its narrative keeps shifting,\u201D Ardoino concluded.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After reading the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2012, Ardoino joined crypto exchange Bitfinex in 2014 and was promoted to chief technology officer after just two years.
