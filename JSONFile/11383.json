It\u2019s yet another example of how protocols may be decentralized and cryptographic and disputive as all get out but the rubber meets the road in business over what are fundamentally simple contract disputes.","According to the Complaint\u200A\u2014\u200Awhich I hasten to add contains unproven allegations and aren\u2019t necessarily true\u200A\u2014\u200APlaintiff and Zerocoin entered into a contract back in August 2016 where Plaintiff would be a Senior Software Engineer. In connection with that, he was granted an option to purchase 12,000 \u201CUnits\u201D of Stock pursuant to a stock incentive plan. This was later amended to grant him 15,000 units. Plaintiff says that he was also promised a share of a \u201CFounders Reward\u201D in proportion to his option grant. (It is unclear who the 50 John\/Jane Does defendants are).","Two years later, on December 31, 2018, plaintiff says the company sent a \u201Cstatus update\u201D to him saying that they hadn\u2019t actually created a stock option plan and that no grants had actually been offered. He send a books and records request several days later asking for access to corporate information to \u201Cdetermine the status and valuation of [promised] units[.]\u201D The company said nope. Things quickly got ugly and Plaintiff says the company basically told him to stop bugging them or they\u2019d fire him. He resigned on May 28, 2019 citing as reasons (1) failure to get the options; (2) \u201Cintolerable working conditions\u201D and (3) be threatened with termination unfairly.","The Complaint has seven, count \u2019em seven counts. First, breach of contract because plaintiff allegedly didn\u2019t give his stock options. Second, \u201Cpromissory fraud\u201D which kind of repeats the contract claim but frames it as fraud (unclear why, if there\u2019s an express written contract). Third and fourth, misrepresentation (negligent and intentional), also unclear why these are alleged if there\u2019s a&nbsp;\u2026 written contract. Fifth, breach of fiduciary duty on the basis that Plaintiff was a \u201Cshareholder and\/or member of Zerocoin\u201D and had a right to review books and records and shouldn\u2019t have had his equity rights diluted. (This particular allegation has a slightly throw it up on the wall feel to it, in this writer\u2019s opinion but, hey, maybe it works in California). Sixth, \u201Cconstructive discharge\u201D or&nbsp;\u2026 I quit but you really fired me. This sort of claim is more typically seen in the age\/gender\/race discrimination context but it\u2019s given a try here. And last but not least, count seven alleges deceptive trade practice under a California statute, to round things out.","Anyways, not much in this lawsuit directly germane to crypto, other than the fact it deals with a company in the space and is a reminder that business disputes involving this emerging technology still seem to wind up in old fashioned courts with old fashioned causes of action.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
