With Flare\u2019s offering now larger than originally envisioned, adjustments were needed to the method of allocation and distribution of the remaining public tokens in order to better support the long term sustainability of the network.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Of the 100B genesis FLR tokens, 58.3B are destined for community hands, with 28.5B of these allocated to the direct public token distribution, also known as the FlareDrop Distribution. The first 15% of these public tokens, or 4.3B FLR, was successfully distributed on January 9 this year to wallets that held XRP during a snapshot completed in December 2020. Prior to FIP.01, the remaining 85% of these tokens were to be provided over 36 months to these same recipients.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Following the approval of FIP.01, the 36 monthly distributions will be made available on-chain, in a decentralized manner, to all wallets that hold Wrapped Flare (WFLR).
