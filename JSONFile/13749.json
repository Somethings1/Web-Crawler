The merge has been eagerly anticipated by crypto developers, who hope that it will make the Ethereum network significantly more energy efficient and cheaper to use.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At around 9:50 PM ET on Thursday, developers simulated the merge on Goerli and switched from PoW to PoS consensus. To do so, they had to \u201Cmerge\u201D Goerli\u2019s code with its PoS-based fork called Prater. The task involved node operators from both chains updating their client software in tandem.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the Goerli merge has been activated, the success of the event will be determined after a thorough evaluation of the upgraded network.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Over the past few months, the core team already performed the merge on two other testnets: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/156013\/ethereum-developers-activate-the-merge-on-sepolia-testnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sepolia<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/150864\/ethereums-ropsten-proof-of-stake-test-merge-goes-live\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ropsten<\/a>. These test merge events have served as practice sessions to check whether client software used to run Ethereum nodes \u2014 like Nethermind, Besu, Geth, and Erigon \u2014 ran normally and without bugs.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the Goerli test merge complete, the team has now finished all of their test merge dress rehearsals. According to the official schedule decided by the Ethereum's developer team, the next step will be to perform the full merge on the Ethereum mainnet. This final upgrade is expected to happen in September.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
