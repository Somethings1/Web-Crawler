No outside digital assets, including stablecoins, were used in the proof-of-concept program.","The group stressed that the wholesale central bank digital currency used in the experiment does not mean that the Federal Reserve has decided to adopt a central bank digital currency, only that the experiment used a CBDC intended for payment between financial institutions as a proof-of-concept for using the technology between central banks and commercial banks for the large, bank-to-bank payments that frequently occur between them. The project also used retail bank digital deposit tokens.","Though no decision has yet been made as far as next steps, other areas that distributed ledger could include securities like stocks and bonds.","Â© 2023 The Block.
