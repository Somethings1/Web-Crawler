He said he wanted to create a platform that adds value and context to these tokenized historical points in time, what he referred to as \u201Cmoments.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The platform\u2019s business model is pretty straightforward. WENEW will connect creators with fans who would like to collect NFTs affiliated with them, and the platform will provide curation and context for each tokenized moment. The platform will take a percentage of each sale (they declined to disclose how much).&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to WENEW CEO Michael Figge, the team behind the platform consists of 15 people, including writers and blockchain engineers.
