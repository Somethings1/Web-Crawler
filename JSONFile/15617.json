BTC was currently trading at about $29,440, down 2%, although it is up about 80% in 2023. The rebound follows a year of distress, in which multiple major firms declared bankruptcy, sending risk-shy investors fleeing from crypto markets.","Read More: Bitcoin Could Peak at $45K in May, Analyst Says","\u201CWe saw throughout the latter part of 2022 a lot of forced selling, and also selling from investors who grew cautious,\u201D Lunde said. \u201CThis has led people to be underexposed. And has also enticed a lot of people to short (crypto) being conservative with adding exposure. This creates this dynamic where bitcoin feeds on your short squeezes and moves higher.\u201D","He added that negative to neutral sales of derivatives, despite recent price gains, were further signs of investor caution. That sentiment could change, although the market\u2019s relatively low liquidity remained a potential weight on future pricing.","Lunde believes that faint signs last week that the U.S. Federal Reserve would scale back its hawkish monetary policy amid mildly encouraging inflation data could boost market sentiment.","He blamed crypto prices\u2019 swoon last year partly on firms overexposing themselves when interest rates were zero.","\u201CIt was a lot of spending, a lot of focus on growth,\u201D Lunde said. \u201CSo you had this environment where miners took a lot of fiat that held a lot of bitcoin and then were exposed to falling prices, in addition to all the crypto banks starting to neglect due diligence.\u201D","But the industry-wide crisis of 2022, which included multiple, major firms declaring bankruptcy, including crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, has already been benefiting markets by weeding out bad actors, Lunde suggested. \u201CA lot of these rotten fruits have been washed out of the market,\u201D he said. \u201CSo the entire market is in a more robust stage right now where it can handle higher interest rates for longer.\u201D","He added: \u201CThe industry has learned. I'm pretty sure that we will experience similar kinds of crisis in the future, unfortunately. But for now, those kinds of risks feel washed out of the market. So the market feels a lot more safe at the moment.","Edited by James Rubin."],"entity":[{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"K33 Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Could Peak","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vetle Lunde","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"James Rubin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lunde","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$45K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$45,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S. Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$29,440","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","crypto markets","crypto industry","CoinDesk TV","First Mover"],"authors":["Fran Velasquez"]}
