The goal is to push for regulations that strike the right balance between promoting innovation and keeping consumers and investors safe, Grewal said.","Grewal highlighted the global trend of countries adopting sensible crypto rules and questioned why the U.S. isn't following suit. As more Americans participate in the crypto space, it\u2019s important for laws and regulations to reflect that, he added.","Grewal also praised the judge's nuanced understanding of the technology in the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/248274\/uniswap-hayden-adams-based-scam-tokens-ruling\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Uniswap decision<\/a> ruling that the decentralized protocol couldn't be held accountable for third-party misuse \u2014 a decision that could set an important precedent for how decentralized platforms, like Coinbase's Base, are viewed in terms of liability, he said.","Coinbase currently faces a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233270\/sec-sues-coinbase-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">violating U.S. securities laws.<\/a>","The Base mainnet officially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243899\/base-mainnet-onchain-summer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">opened<\/a> to the public on Aug. 9, with daily active users surpassing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244333\/coinbase-l2-base-dau-friendtech\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">100,000<\/a> \u2014 partly attributed to the hype surrounding social network <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/246423\/friend-tech-fees\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Friend.tech<\/a> and Base's \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244624\/coca-cola-masterpiece-nft-ethereum-coinbase-base\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Onchain Summer<\/a>\" initiative.","Daily transactions on the Ethereum Layer 2 have also recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/246248\/ethereum-layer-2-base-daily-transactions-flip-optimism-arbitrum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">surged<\/a> past those of the dominant optimistic rollup scaling solutions Arbitrum and Optimism, according to The Block's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/scaling-solutions\/optimistic-rollups\/transaction-count-daily-7dma\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data dashboard<\/a>.
