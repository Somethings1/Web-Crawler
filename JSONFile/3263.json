According to blockchain.com data, the top five known mining pools are also all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/en\/pools\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">based<\/a> in China. Still, Liegl hopes the firm will stand out due to its focus on minimizing the cost of electricity versus maximizing the efficiency of chips.","\"We expect our chips to be competitive for at least eight years now...you want to have your own chips in hand. We also have our own electricity substations: effectively that's as close you can get to owning your own power plant,\" said Liegl.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To that end, the company has bought a dozen acres of land in Texas to build its own electricity substations, partnered with a Beijing-based semiconductor company to create its own mining chips, and built its own mining machine infrastructure. The ultimate goal, according to Liegl, is to own every step of the bitcoin mining supply chain and vertically integrate the mining business. For instance, the firm might expand into lending, derivatives, and other corners of the bitcoin market. Liegl described the firm as the Exxon Mobile of crypto.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">All my ASICs live in Texas<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While China\u2019s triumph in bitcoin mining is in part due to its cheap electricity, this recipe to profit can also be replicated in Texas, according to Liegl. Indeed, he said&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Texas has one of the most competitive electricity prices in the world and has many renewable energy plants that Layer1 can utilize to reduce operational costs.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, the hot weather in Texas may present a substantial challenge to bitcoin mining.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mining facilities are usually maintained in cold regions or air-conditioned environment to cool mining machines. To take advantage of Texas\u2019 low electricity prices, Liegl said they have developed a special cooling technology that \u201Ccreates only additional power draw of 3%\u201D of the power that mining machines consume.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe electricity prices in Texas have always been extremely competitive, what happened is that nobody in the cryptocurrency mining industry has been able to take advantage of that yet, since they lack the appropriate cooling technology,\u201D said Liegl.&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mining ain't easy<\/strong>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To be sure, building a mining facility from scratch incurs significantly more upfront costs than directly buying mining machines and using electricity from local power stations. Last week, Virginia-based bitcoin mining firm BCause Mining <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pilotonline.com\/business\/vp-bz-bcause-bankruptcy-liquidation-20191009-lwot3gx5pnd6di4byqdg3q7tdi-story.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> for bankruptcy. In 2018, the company had pledged to invest $64.8 million to expand its business into \u201Cthe largest cryptocurrency mining operating in North America\". Now a total of&nbsp; 23 creditors claim the company owes them $13.3 million.&nbsp;<\/span>","Meanwhile, in the past, U.S. towns chosen by foreign money for mining often face opposition from local communities, doubting whether these mining facilities can truly provide the employment opportunities that they need. For example, Bitmain, which had at one time said it will create the largest mining facility in Texas that created around 350 jobs, ended up hiring less than 15 employees during the price plunge earlier this year, per a Wired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/hard-luck-texas-town-bet-bitcoin-lost\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a>.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, according to Liegl, running a mining farm in the U.S. has both economic and ideological significance.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI feel very strongly about this, which is you need a U.S. representative in order to create more symmetric distribution in hash power, that would definitely be a net positive for the community and the protocol.\"<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
