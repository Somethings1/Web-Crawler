Kentucky, NO. 5:19-CV-122-TBR, 10\/18\/2019) [SDP]<\/strong>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/431040439\/Kingdom\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Link to case<\/a>","For all of you crypto civil procedure mavens, this opinion offers a nice primer on personal jurisdiction and happens to involve an underlying dispute involving cryptocurrencies held by a trust custodian for individual retirement accounts (\u201CIRAs\u201D.)","The plaintiff Kingdom Services owns a company called Kingdom Trust, a South Dakota company with its principal place of business in Kentucky which is the trust custodian you read about just words away in the preceding paragraph. The defendant is a Delaware LLC with its principal place of business in California. It does business under a bunch of different names including Bitcoin IRA. BitGo Inc., also a defendant, is a Delaware corporation, and it has an affiliate named BitGo trust which is a South Dakota corporation.","Back in early 2018, plaintiff entered into a contract with Bitcoin IRA for use of a technology platform so customers could buy and sell crypto in their IRA. Things went south, and as often ensues when things go south, there was a lawsuit. Here\u2019s the gist:","(The lawsuit was previously covered <a class=\"bt da mr ms mt mu\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/37816\/kingdom-trust-sues-competitor-bitgo-and-bitcoin-ira-for-allegedly-using-its-trade-secrets-to-steal-clients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">here<\/a>, if you\u2019re interested in further reading about the allegations.)","Anyway, these allegations are all well and good, but as regular readers of CCM will recall, a Court can\u2019t entertain a lawsuit when it doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction over the parties. And therein, friends, lies the rub. No personal jurisdiction.","The defendants said they had nothing to do with Kentucky, which is where this lawsuit was filed and so moved to dismiss on those grounds. Most states (it may be all, and probably is, but I haven\u2019t done a survey) have statutes that cover personal jurisdiction over non-resident defendants. They are called \u201Clong arm\u201D statutes. A federal court in this kind of case \u2014 diversity jurisdiction, to be technical \u2014 uses the long arm statute of the state where they are located.","That\u2019s what this court did, holding that there just wasn\u2019t enough connection with Kentucky for the lawsuit to be adjudicated there. For example:","Bottom line, this Bitcoin IRA lawsuit didn\u2019t have enough to do with Kentucky to be heard in a Kentucky federal court. Result = case dismissed.","<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Crypto Caselaw Minute is provided for educational purposes only by Stephen Palley (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson Rosario (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nelsonmrosario\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@nelsonmrosario<\/a>).
