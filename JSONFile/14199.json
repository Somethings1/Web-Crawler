Its price spiked by 1,300% in October as a result. Eisenberg and his team were then able to use the inflated MNGO as collateral to take out more USDC on loans \u2014 all of which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177424\/mango-markets-exploiter-comes-clean-claims-all-actions-were-legal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">he admitted to<\/a>, while maintaining that his actions were legal.&nbsp;","Eisenberg is already in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/199357\/mango-markets-exploiter-detention\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">custody and facing criminal manipulation charges<\/a> from the Department of Justice. By joining in, the CFTC is saying that swaps \u2014 even on decentralized exchanges \u2014 in at least some cryptocurrencies are part of its remit as a regulator.","The CFTC is under pressure in the aftermath of FTX's bankruptcy. Up until its collapse, FTX was pushing a bill in Congress that would give the CFTC a bigger role in crypto markets, a push that the CFTC and its commissioners joined.","With former FTX CEO facing criminal charges, the CFTC is fighting accusations of regulatory capture by ill-doers. Chairman Rostin Behnam is still defending the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/190289\/cftc-chair-defends-bill-that-ftxs-bankman-fried-also-backed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bill's central push<\/a>, but he and the other commissioners are eager to demonstrate that the regulator is capable of holding crypto companies and other actors to account.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
