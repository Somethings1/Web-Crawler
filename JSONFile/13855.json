This modification is the result of an <a href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/hashflowdao.eth\/proposal\/0x014a10517b46f895583de15713733147ca960f18a40c45d6653db7a150797ba7\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">approved proposal<\/a> by the Hashflow DAO and aims to establish the protocol\u2019s first revenue stream.","\u201CBy distributing fee proceeds among token stakers as well as the Foundation, this proposal creates a sustainable model that will benefit all stakeholders in the Hashflow ecosystem,\u201D said Varun Kumar, co-founder of Hashflow.","Revenue generated from these fees will be allocated as follows: 50% will be distributed to HFT token stakers, 30% will be earmarked for the community treasury specifically for HFT buybacks, and the remaining 20% will cover the Hashflow Foundation\u2019s operating expenses.","The team has not revealed the exact fee amount for trades, although it has said the fee will be dynamic based on the size of the swap.
