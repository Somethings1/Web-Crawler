But others are not, and thus authorization to issue subpoenas to those with the missing information is critical to the debtors\u2019 and committee\u2019s recovery efforts,\u201D lawyers for the FTX debtors and the official creditors committee wrote in a joint motion.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The filing names Bankman-Fried's parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, and his brother, Gabriel Bankman-Fried, saying the trio acted as his advisers.

Representatives for FTX and its affiliated companies, as well as joint provisional liquidators for FTX's trading operation in the Bahamas, have pushed back on a request. In court documents filed on Wednesday they argued that an examiner would duplicate their investigative efforts and cost the companies millions of dollars, which would reduce assets they have on hand to pay back customers and investors.&nbsp;","Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in a separate case for his alleged wrongdoing at FTX. Ellison and Wang have pleaded guilty to criminal charges and are cooperating with federal authorities, according to government court filings.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
