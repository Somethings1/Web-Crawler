Due to the sentiment driven nature of crypto, they are prone to large price adjustments and consequent spikes on volumes through the exchanges.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As an exchange operator, LMAX Group has built both its institutional FX and cryptocurrency execution venues on the same low latency, high throughput institutional grade infrastructure to manage this kind of intense volatility. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lmaxdigital.com\/overview\/?utm_source=TheBlock&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredpost&amp;utm_content=link2&amp;utm_campaign=02feb2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LMAX Digital<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, the Group\u2019s spot cryptocurrency exchange, frequently experiences and manages high-order rate spikes. Additionally, in the equally fast-moving FX market, it is not uncommon to see several hundred price updates per millisecond in major currency pairs, meaning its technology has to size accordingly for these peaks.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;Due to these order rate spikes, crypto exchanges, including those catering to retail investors, tend to suffer during these. One problem is that whilst their infrastructure is effective on human time scales of seconds to minutes, dealing with an order spike of 10-100 millisecond duration is often too short for the scaling systems to react.<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Challenging perceptions<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With these drawbacks and exchange outages an all-too-common occurrence, the solution may lie in learning a thing or two from traditional market infrastructure.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cryptocurrency evangelists point to outages as being a fundamental limitation of centralised exchanges, although LMAX Group would argue strongly against this. There are plenty of central financial exchanges quietly powering the global economy with latencies a thousand times better than the \u2018crypto household names\u2019 and with throughputs far more efficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LMAX Group has long been providing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lmaxdigital.com\/technology\/?utm_source=TheBlock&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredpost&amp;utm_content=link3&amp;utm_campaign=02feb2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">institutional grade infrastructure<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to its clients, with 100% uptime and zero outages.

Its order latency did not change from a reliable base line of just less than 200µs, even while processing 6,000 orders\/second, whilst the Group\u2019s institutional FX exchange was also processing 60,000 orders\/second on what was an unexceptional trading day.<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Traditional infrastructure is the foundation to understanding the next iteration of exchanges&nbsp;<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As each generation invents the world anew, sometimes the same hard lessons must be relearnt. There is often an assumption touted from the cryptocurrency evangelists that there is nothing to learn from traditional finance infrastructure and blockchain technology will sweep away all that came before.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As large institutions enter and increasingly explore the crypto market, their expectations for robustness shouldn\u2019t change from what they expect in trading matured asset classes, such as FX.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The problem also is not \u2018centralised exchanges\u2019, it is that many nascent crypto exchanges have not learnt the hard lessons of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lmaxdigital.com\/trading\/?utm_source=TheBlock&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredpost&amp;utm_content=link5&amp;utm_campaign=02feb2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">scalability, performance and reliability<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, central to other asset classes.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LMAX Group therefore believes in cultivating understanding within the institutional community that robust, reliable institutional grade exchange technology exists for trading this nascent asset class.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There are more mainframes now in the world than there were in the 1970\u2019s.
