AI will \u201Caccelerate and empower even more creators,\u201D he said.","The Sandbox, a culture and entertainment platform, is a user-generated and virtual gaming tool where users can build, own and sell their gaming experiences. The Hong Kong-based platform\u2019s Game Client was installed over 1.3 million times last year, and has a digital presence in countries including Japan, China, Dubai and Saudi Arabia, Borget said.","AI has garnered widespread attention. Some of its use cases, including ChatGPT\u2019s text generator, have been met with warm and not so warm reactions. In March, for example, Neal Stephenson, author of \u201CSnow Crash,\u201D a science-fiction classic novel where he coined the term \u201Cmetaverse,\u201D said that AI in general, and platforms like ChatGPT specifically, were not \u201Cat all interesting\u201D to him.","Nonetheless, Borget said AI is one of the systems that could spur the growth of the metaverse. The technology removes the need to create every aspect of an environment or an avatar character, he said. AI can help \u201Cgenerate and populate the experiences that you create much faster,\u201D he added.","AI can be leveraged by creators as a way to make the metaverse \u201Cmore full of life, fun to play, creative and inclusive overall,\u201D Borget said.","Read more: France Publishes Metaverse Consultation, Seeking Alternative to Dominance by Web Giants","Edited by Ben Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"Sebastian Borget","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Saudi Arabia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ben Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"First Mover\u201D","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Web Giants","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"France Publishes Metaverse Consultation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Borget","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Neal Stephenson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Web3","Metaverse","AI","CoinDesk TV","Sandbox","Sebastien Borget"],"authors":["Fran Velasquez"]}
