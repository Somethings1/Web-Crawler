The miner that creates a block is rewarded with both a subsidy \u2014 currently 6.25 BTC \u2014 as well as transaction fees, but the process is highly energy-intensive.","Miners run specialized hardware around the clock and they make a profit when the cost to produce blocks is greater than what they paid for power and other resources. Numerous U.S. crypto companies have emerged in recent years, particularly in Texas.&nbsp;","Such growth has sparked opposition, most notably in New York where lawmakers advanced and passed a two-year moratorium on some crypto mining operations. The legislation has yet to be officially signed into law by New York Governor Kathy Hochul, and officials such as New York Mayor Eric Adams have called for a veto of the legislation.","Other proposals in the report include more comprehensive data collection on crypto mining energy use and the development of \"energy conservation standards for crypto-asset mining equipment, blockchains, and other operations.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
