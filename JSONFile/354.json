Allegations circulated that Ellison \u2014 in lockstep with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried \u2014 may have taken billions of dollars that belonged to FTX clients and used it to try and cover a slew of poor trades and investments made by Alameda. Just days later, both firms filed for bankruptcy protection, a dark and immediate turn for the two young, rising stars who as colleagues and one-time romantic partners had dreamed of giving away tons of money to charity as part of their belief in a philosophy known as \u201Ceffective altruism.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Customers and regulators are now looking for answers as the entire industry teeters in the wake of the collapse.
