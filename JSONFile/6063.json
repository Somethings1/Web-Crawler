This rise in network usage has precipitated a spike in transaction costs, with average transaction costs rising to over 7,000 Gwei (from 100 Gwei a day prior), before reducing to around 400 Gwei, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/polygonscan.com\/gastracker\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygonscan<\/a>.","The heightened costs for transactions, especially token swaps on the blockchain, rose as high as $5 for swaps, which was a massive increase from the usual rates on the network. This has now come down to under $0.50.","Yet even during the transaction fee surge, the cost of transactions on the Polygon network remained lower than the Ethereum mainnet, where the cost of token swaps can range from $30 to $50.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygon PoS Chain Daily Transactions | Source: Polygonscan<\/span>","A Polygon contributor said that the activity can be attributed to a new type of tokens referred as \"PRC-20,\" an Ordinals-inspired token standard on Polygon.

It involves a process known as \u201Cinscription,\u201D which assigns data to individual satoshis across the Bitcoin network. However, Polygon-based PRC-20s adopt a different strategy, utilizing transaction calldata to generate tokens or unique NFT-like image artifacts that are embedded within the network transactions.","Developers have previously launched tokens on the Ethereum mainnet in June by leveraging a similar Ordinals-inspired protocol called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236632\/ordinals-like-tokens-on-ethereum-surge-past-1-million-in-volume\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facet<\/a>.","Â© 2023 The Block.
