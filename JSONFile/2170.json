Aethir did not disclose the specific amount raised from this round.","The investment will fund the Singapore-based project\u2019s expansion into key markets like South East Asia, Latin America and North America, as well as building out its decentralized cloud infrastructure to a growing network of AI companies and gaming studios, Aethir said.","\u201CThe cloud sector has traditionally been a challenging industry to scale, plagued by high costs, particularly for customers requiring complex real-time rendering or streaming infrastructure \u2014 and that\u2019s not taking into account the additional stress on the ecosystem as a result of the AI boom,\u201D Aethir co-founder and CEO Mark Rydon said.","Aethir\u2019s latest fundraising follows a previous Seed round led by Framework Ventures and Infinity Ventures Crypto in January 2022.","\"We're backing projects that are using the blockchain to solve real-world issues. Aethir is meaningfully expanding the addressable market for gaming and other streaming content in the world's highest-growth (but hardware-constrained) markets. Everybody wins as Aethir expands \u2014 gamers, publishers and globally distributed rendering node operators alike,\u201D Maelstrom CIO and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes said.","\"For the metaverse to become a populated, engaging, virtual universe, the underlying infrastructure needs to support efficient, low-cost computation. Aethir is part of this next-generation infrastructure stack that unlocks the gaming and social communication possibilities we have been waiting for,\u201D Sanctor Capital CEO Han Kao added.","Â© 2023 The Block.
