Suberra seeks to change current crypto payment experience by building game-changing infrastructure that allows crypto pull-based payments, making payment experience from crypto wallets into one that is similar to credit cards.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Their vision is for businesses to be able to accept crypto payments for anything; from online payments to recurring payments such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.suberra.com\/Subscriptions\/how-subscriptions-work\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">subscriptions<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The platform is non-custodial; customers and businesses can have peace of mind on the security of their funds, as they do not store any funds on accounts or smart contracts. Suberra is also multi-chain, and merchants can accept crypto on popular EVM chains.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Infrastructure for Pull-based Payments<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:320,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CConsumers are used to the convenience credit cards offer - enter your details once and you will get charged automatically.

This is not ideal if the user has to sign and broadcast transactions for recurring payments manually. To solve this, Suberra has built a foundational infrastructure that allows pull-based payments on the blockchain. Users only need to authorize a transaction once, and Suberra can charge recurring transactions automatically.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SaaS-based businesses or content creators offering paid content such as newsletters, videos or blogs will benefit from this product.

With EIP-5827, users can now set a spending limit - say 500 USDC per month - as the amount that can be charged from their wallet. This spending limit can be changed at any time by the user. If a malicious actor tries to make a payment that exceeds this spending limit, the payment will be declined, thus protecting the user\u2019s funds. This auto-renewable allowance will enable many traditional financial concepts, such as credit and debit limits, to be brought on-chain.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Suberra is committed to building public infrastructure that accelerates crypto adoption.
