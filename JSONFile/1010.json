The minimal unit for Aptos \u2014 similar to a satoshi, or a wei \u2014 will be called an octa.","The blockchain's tokens will be split between the community (51%), core contributors (19%), the foundation (16.5%) and investors (13.48%).","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Here's how the Aptos circulating supply will increase over time.

Tokens allocated to core contributors and investors are subject to a four-year vesting period.","The foundation also noted that 82% of tokens on the network are already being staked and receiving staking rewards. It appears that those staking their tokens \u2014 even if they are subject to vesting periods \u2014 will be able to access and sell their staking rewards.","The current maximum annual staking reward is 7% and is set to decline by 1.5% per year until it reaches 3.25% \u2014 which is expected to take around 50 years.","Prior to the tokenomics summary going live, many crypto users had complained that trading of the blockchain's token was about to begin without this information available.","\"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It's not great that FTX\/Binance etc are all listing Aptos without any tokenomics transparency at all,\" said prominent crypto trader Cobie. \"Surely it should be a prerequisite to listing something that users can have the basic information on what they're buying lol.<\/span>\"&nbsp;","FTX and Binance are listing Aptos on <span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Oct. 19 at 1am (UTC).<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
