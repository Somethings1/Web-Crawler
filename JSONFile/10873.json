At one of the panels, speakers pointed out that miners will have a very hard time keeping up if they aren't<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> extremely cost-competitive and using the latest and most efficient machines.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAll of us are moving full speed ahead, guns blazing,\u201D said Marathon CEO Fred Thiel.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mike Levitt, chairman and CEO of Core Scientific, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said that capital markets have tightened up in the past few months, making it harder for anyone in between a very small or large scale miner. He said that at this point you can either be \"scaled and efficient\" or <\/span>make a little bit of money by being \"very small [and] nimble.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"I wouldn't want to be trying to start to build a scale business today. It's just not easy to do that,\" he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Levitt, getting the cost of goods (including power and equipment) and the productivity level balanced by building a well-designed operation are crucial factors.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jason Les, CEO of Riot, added that the biggest barrier to entry to the industry is know-how.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What does decentralized mining look like? Is it all about the geography or the ownership of the machines? This topic came up a few times during the conference, with a few speakers pointing towards the latter as the most crucial aspect.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CHistorically, we've looked at decentralization as just purely physical locations,\u201D said Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer at Bitfarms. \u201CBut if you're looking at that vulnerability on a 51% attack, it's not the physical distribution of mining equipment that matters. It's the ownership of that mining equipment that matters. I can control 51% of hashrate all throughout the world. I don't need to control it all in one location.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stephen Barbour, the owner of Upstream Data, also pointed to ownership of hashrate as the most important factor.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C[Hashrate] can be jurisdictionally spread out. If it\u2019s the same owner it's not a huge difference if it\u2019s distributed geographically,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CEO Barefoot Mining Bob Burnett said that decentralization should be looked at from other perspectives, such as power sources and ASIC technology.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere's all kinds of different places in which centralization can occur and I honestly <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">think we're becoming more centralized. I don't think we are dangerously centralized right now, but I think there are some vectors that worry me,\u201D Burnett said, pointing at the<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;move from China to the US.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"I am concerned that most of the mega-site development is also public companies. I think that's a really, really dangerous place,\u201D he said. \u201CThat is a cultural change for a company and I frankly think it can be a very fiat move, that it takes a Bitcoin-centric company and forces a fiat mindset into it.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There was no shortage of praise and encouragement for home mining during the conference. At one point, many hands in the audience shot up as one speaker asked how many attendees had done any sort of mining at home.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Some of the speakers shared their perspectives on how future products could make it easier for people who are not as tech-savvy to have miners at home, combining that main function with heat applications.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On a different scale, Jonathan Yuan, owner of Coin Heated, is already using the wasted heat from bitcoin miners as a product, partnering with other companies.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI'm working with a whiskey Distillery and they want to preheat all their water. (...) So you\u2019re cooling your ASICs, you're getting your warm water. It\u2019s a win-win,\u201D Yuan said. \u201CEverywhere I'm looking now for industrial applications, anywhere there's heat I\u2019m like \u2018ooh, I can heat that.\u2019\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yun also shared that he has heated a whole pool in the cold weather using only heat from miners.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">China\u2019s crackdown on mining and, more recently, the exodus of miners from Kazakhstan, has deeply changed the landscape of the industry.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Marathon\u2019s CEO Fred Thiel indicated during a panel that stability was a major factor in finding new mining locations.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CYou're putting a lot of capital to work in a place and it takes you a few years to get that money back. And the last thing you want is a bunch of people with AK-47s pulling up in the Jeep saying \u2018thank you for building such a wonderful facility, you\u2019re no longer needed, goodbye,\u2019\u201D he said.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
