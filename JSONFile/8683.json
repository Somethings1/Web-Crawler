Polygon becomes the fourth blockchain supported by Taurus's tokenization platform, following Ethereum, Tezos and Cardano.","There was a high demand to integrate Polygon from clients, \"especially large banks,\" Victor Busson, chief marketing officer and head of strategic partnerships at Taurus, told The Block. Polygon's key benefits as an Ethereum scaling network include low fees, increased speed and a \"user-friendly smart contract development platform and tools,\" Busson said.","On-chain asset tokenization is seen by some as the next big catalyst for mainstream crypto adoption.

It enables fractional ownership, liquidity and transferability of assets that are ordinarily illiquid or indivisible, such as real estate. Tokenized assets can be traded, transferred and accessed more easily on blockchain platforms, proponents say.&nbsp;<\/span>","Taurus's tokenization business has swollen in recent months. Busson said 70% of the company's clients are now using its tokenization platform compared to just 10% two years ago. He declined to share the size of assets tokenized through Taurus's infrastructure.","Founded in 2018, Taurus provides an infrastructure to issue, custody, and trade digital assets and is currently focused on serving banks and financial institutions in Europe. It has plans to expand across the globe.
