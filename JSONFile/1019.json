The significant price decline occurred despite Algorand's great pedigree. The project was founded by MIT professor and Turing Award winner Silvio Micali and backed by well known venture capital firms like Union Square Ventures.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As staggering as the drop is, however, it's hardly a surprise to some traders and investors that The Block spoke with. Some experts predict that the price has more room to fall. The main reason cited is the rapidly increasing circulating supply as well as the early investors that opted to participate as validators who are still seeing returns of more than 800%.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/messari.io\/asset\/algorand#profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Messari<\/a><\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Too many tokens<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The project\u2019s long term plan is to have a maximum circulating supply of <a href=\"https:\/\/info.binance.com\/en\/research\/ALGO-2019-06-21.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">10 billion Algo<\/a>. 3 billion of that supply will be released in public auctions over the next five years, with a yearly cap of 600 million tokens sold. Although this figure for circulating Algo sounds enormous, there is a catch - public investors can receive a 90% refund by returning Algo after a year long lock-up period. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This means that for investors who purchase at auction, the downside of buying Algo is somewhat protected.

However, some investors, who spoke with The Block under the condition of anonymity, raised doubts at this definition, questioning whether there are tokens from undisclosed sales that will eventually enter the market as well.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Algorand did not conduct a private token sale; rather the project completed two rounds of equity fundraising for a total of $66 million.
