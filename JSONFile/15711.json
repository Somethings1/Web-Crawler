It later corrected that statement in an email, saying that the SEC was not involved in the process.","Green light image via Shutterstock"],"entity":[{"type":"Asiff Hirji","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Venovate Marketplace and Digital Wealth LLC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jay Clayton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shutterstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Keystone Capital Corp.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dan Romero","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Coinbase","Exchanges","Regulation","News","Securities","republished","us-canada"],"authors":["Wolfie Zhao"]}
