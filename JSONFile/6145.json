Still, that proposal may face an uphill battle, even among Democrats, who may lose their majorities in midterm elections.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hesitance to address algorithmic stablecoins in law has been a fairly bipartisan feature of proposed stablecoin legislation. There have been increasing suggestions that Republicans are looking at algorithmic stablecoins more as money market funds, which face regulation by the SEC and are accessible only via registered broker-dealers.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Among Republicans a party line seems to be developing that the collapse of Terra and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/146490\/tethers-market-price-slips-below-dollar-parity-amid-ongoing-stablecoin-woes\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tether\u2019s subsequent slip<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> should primarily fuel legislation on fiat-backed stablecoins.

Of the Terra collapse, he said that \"there is no systemic risk, certainly not right now and I don't think in the future, because the nature of the algorithmic stablecoins is that they are not backed by an asset that would be subject to a systemic risk.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That argument seems to have some resonance even among moderate Democrats.
