However, while blockchain based mobile games have become more playable and fun, the friction in joining a blockchain-based game has not improved. With 43% of mobile users simply abandoning a game because of a sign-in process that takes more than a few seconds, it is table-stakes that user onboarding be as seamless in blockchain based games as it is for non-blockchain games.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There are companies saying they\u2019ve solved these onboarding issues for Web3 gaming, but they don\u2019t come close to the seamless onboarding that players expect. Solutions like Venly, Sequence, and Magic Link make the sign-in experience easier, but players are presented in-game with a foreign, high-friction user experience, leading to large scale player drop off and frustration before they start.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The only option for mainstream adoption is to make the Web3 gaming experience as seamless as it is in non-blockchain games today. <\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This is accomplished in two ways:<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">5 years ago, I was a software engineer at Bloomberg and couldn\u2019t buy a CryptoKitty, even with all the guides and tutorials online.
