Otherwise, he argued, the U.S. will \u201Close the next great growth engine that this country needs.\u201D","His thoughts came in a <a href=\"https:\/\/blogmaverick.com\/2021\/06\/13\/the-brilliance-of-yield-farming-liquidity-providing-and-valuing-crypto-projects\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blog post<\/a> entitled \u201CThe Brilliance of Yield Farming, Liquidity Providing and Valuing Crypto Projects.\u201D&nbsp;","At the end of the post, Cuban discussed the broader potential of the DeFi industry. He noted that DeFi projects are, by their very nature, decentralized and not located in the U.S. The entrepreneur then partly put the blame on regulators for pushing innovation out of the country.","\u201CThis is not only because of the ethos of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOS), but also because of the ABSOLUTE STUPIDITY of our regulators forcing some of the most impactful and innovative entrepreneurs of this generation to foreign countries to run their businesses,\u201D he said.","Cuban predicted that in 10 to 20 years we will look back at this period of time and observe that world-changing companies were built. \u201CAmong those companies, [it\u2019s] already a certainty that De-Fi and other crypto organizations will be at or near the top of the list,\u201D he said, before warning that if politicians choose to continue to dampen innovation, this growth potential could be wasted.","The post also went more deeply into his recent thoughts about DeFi, particularly focusing on certain projects he has invested in, including Ethereum scaling solution <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/polygon-a-technical-overview-105799\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygon<\/a> and lending protocol <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/75003\/aave-becomes-second-defi-protocol-to-hit-1-billion-in-total-value-locked\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aave<\/a>.","Cuban said that the main differences between traditional businesses and decentralized ones is that the DeFi firms don\u2019t need to raise as much money to begin with \u2014 or focus on maximizing profits.","\u201CThat is not to say that every crypto blockchain or DeFi project will work. They won\u2019t,\u201D Cuban said, adding, \u201CCrypto is brutally competitive. But in crypto vs traditional, centralized businesses, all other things being equal, I\u2019m taking crypto every time.\u201D","When it comes to choosing which tokens to invest in, Cuban said that he looks at factors including current revenue, growth rates, how likely projects will keep a competitive advantage and the strength of the community behind the project \u2014 the latter presumably explaining his fondness for Dogecoin.","Â© 2023 The Block.
