We should look at the big deal in connection with what happened in Hong Kong just days before,\u201D he added. \u201CI don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all a coincidence.\u201D &nbsp;","Authorities in Hong Kong <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-05-23\/hong-kong-to-step-up-push-for-crypto-hub-in-contrast-with-clampdowns-in-asia?leadSource=uverify%20wall\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said last week<\/a> that retail trading of larger tokens will be permitted in the region from June 1 \u2014 part of widely-broadcast plans to transform the city into a hub for digital assets.","Another potential non-coincidence is the hard-line regulators in the United States have taken on crypto since the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX late last year.","Since then, the Securities and Exchange Commission has filed charges against multiple crypto outfits, as well as some celebrities who had endorsed cryptocurrencies. Concurrently, two crypto-friendly banks in the U.S. \u2014 Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank \u2014 have been shut down by regulators, leaving precious few banking options for startups in the space.","Asia\u2019s emerging crypto hubs \u2014 such Singapore, Seoul and Hong Kong \u2014 appear to sense opportunity stemming from the crypto crisis in the U.S., but Siu thinks Beijing may have other motives for nurturing the sector.","\u201CEvery developer in the world is dependent on Apple\u2019s whims to approve whether the app can exist \u2014 and they just happen to be American,\u201D Siu said.","\u201CThe technologies around web2 have created a different kind of colonization of American technology to the world. Almost every country in the world is dependent on Facebook and LinkedIn and Google and Microsoft and all that kind of stuff, and web3 provides an opportunity for other sovereign nations to basically say, \u2018Let\u2019s build a different framework that is either more open or more inclusive or maybe even more sovereign.\u2019\u201D","The Block Research\u2019s deals dashboard, which tracks publicly available information, puts Animoca as the sector\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/deals\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">second most active investor<\/a> with 232 total deals \u2014 behind only Coinbase Ventures with 366. Siu, however, said the company now boasts around 450 investments to date. Whatever the case, the pace of Animoca\u2019s deployment seems relatively stable. The Block Research counts 25 deals for the company in 2023 as of May 12 \u2014 making it the sector\u2019s sixth most active investor this year. &nbsp;","Animoca is currently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-01-05\/hong-kong-crypto-mogul-aims-to-raise-1-billion-for-web3-fund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">seeking $1 billion<\/a> from external investors for a web3 and metaverse fund, having initially targeted twice that amount. The fund is currently applying for a license to operate in Hong Kong, Siu said.&nbsp;","Whether a greater proportion of Animoca\u2019s capital ends up focused on Asia in the future remains to be seen. Siu \u2014 who founded Animoca in Hong Kong in 2011 and pivoted the business into crypto and NFTs in around 2017 \u2014 said the business won\u2019t yet pump the brakes on U.S. investments. He conceded, though, that Animoca is already encouraging its startups to consider their options. &nbsp;","\u201CI mean clearly the opportunities based in Asia are better, and so we advise all our companies that are in the U.S. also to look at Asia as an opportunity,\u201D Siu said, adding that the U.S. is \u201Cthrowing away its lead in this space for entirely political reasons.\u201D","\u201CI say this half-jokingly, but I do mean it when I say that the American dream is much more alive and well in Asia than it is in America.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
