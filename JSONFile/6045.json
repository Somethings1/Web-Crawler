I know that my team worked all through the Christmas holidays and over the last week, too, to be sure we\u2019re ready to go,\u201D he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;","\u201CThere is a lot of work behind the scenes to go into something like that \u2014 it\u2019s not like a normal ETF. One complication here is that you have two custodians, one for crypto and one for cash, and making sure that these two accounts are connected. It\u2019s almost like double work to get launched in a situation like that,\u201D McClurg explained.","The biggest hope for the bitcoin spot ETF so far has been that it will attract the U.S. institutional investors, but McClurg said it\u2019s likely that retail investors will be the first to pour money in. \u201COut of the gate, it\u2019s going to be mostly retail, some financial advisors, and I also expect a lot of outflows from GBTC,\u201D he said, referring to Grayscale\u2019s fund that the company is currently trying to convert into an ETF, too.&nbsp;","This is partly because financial advisors normally take some time to watch new financial products trade before they can recommend them to clients, he said, noting: \u201CMost financial advisers require two to three years of a track record from an ETF.\u201D","The biggest difference between launching a \u201Cnormal\u201D ETF and a spot bitcoin ETF is that, in the latter case, an issuer has to make the SEC comfortable with the fact it\u2019s holding its assets not with a traditional custodian but a crypto exchange.","While most of the bitcoin ETF issuers list Coinbase as their custodian, the exchange itself has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270979\/what-the-secs-lawsuit-with-coinbase-means-for-the-exchanges-pivotal-role-in-spot-bitcoin-etfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fighting a lawsuit<\/a> from the SEC. However, McClurg does not see it as an existential threat to Coinbase\u2019s business but rather a normal part of any financial firm\u2019s reality.&nbsp;","\u201CThat is not something I\u2019m really concerned about. Any financial institution on Wall Street, think Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley \u2014 they all had SEC lawsuits, SEC investigations and it\u2019s typically one part of their business. When it comes to Coinbase, we\u2019re dealing with the custody side of their business, and most of the SEC complaints are on the consumer-exchange side of their business,\u201D he said, adding that Coinbase\u2019s custody business is \u201Cperfectly fine.\u201D","Another intrigue of the spot ETF race has been a stark <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270851\/bitcoin-spot-etf-fees-race-to-the-bottom\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fee competition<\/a> between the issuers, who seemed to outbid each other with the lowest fees possible Monday morning. According to the latest filings, different issuers offer fees from 0.24% to 1.5%, with the highest offer from Grayscale and lowest from Bitwise. (Valkyrie offers 0.8%.)","When asked how the firm is planning to make profit with the fees so low, McClurg said such products may stay unprofitable for a while and that\u2019s ok.","\u201CAny time you launch an ETF it always loses money in the early stages and starts making money later, so you just have to be prepared for that. ETFs shut down all the time because they don\u2019t gather the assets that they need,\u201D he said, adding that Valkyrie, however, is expecting its ETF to become profitable in the first year of trading.&nbsp;","\u201CWe\u2019ve been working on this ETF for three years now, we\u2019re not gonna give up after even a couple of years. The ETF business is a tough one and you have to be committed to doing this long-term,\u201D McClurg said.","\u201CBitcoin, obviously, is a very exciting place where people are going to be gathered for a long time,\u201D he added.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
