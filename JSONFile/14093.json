The analyst argued that while an ETF would help enable crypto to take off in the U.S., the SEC chair still sees the industry as needing more stringent compliance.","\u201CSEC Chair Gensler is not embracing crypto in the U.S., and it might even be a very long shot to expect that he would vote to approve bitcoin spot ETFs,\u201D Thielen wrote. \u201CThis might be fulfilled by Q2 2024, but we expect the SEC to reject all proposals in January.\u201D","\"There's been far too much fraud and bad actors in the crypto field,\" Gensler <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/267720\/gensler-says-secs-new-look-at-spot-bitcoin-etf-applications-has-involved-recent-court-rulings\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told<\/a> CNBC last month. \"There's a lot of non-compliance, not only with the securities laws, but other laws around anti-money laundering and protecting the public against bad actors there,\" the SEC chair added.","The crypto industry has been vying for a spot bitcoin ETF for years, with BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie and VanEck among the current total 14 asset managers hoping to finally win SEC approval.","If the bitcoin spot ETF applications are denied by the SEC this month, Thielen expects to see cascading liquidations as billions of dollars in perpetual long bitcoin futures unwind. This could lead to bitcoin\u2019s price dropping sharply by around 20%, back into the $36,000 to $38,000 range, he said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_positive\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      +0.56%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> is currently trading at $44,562, according to The Block\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">price page<\/a>.
