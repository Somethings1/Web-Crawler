Previously, GBTC was first offered in 2013 as a private placement exempt from SEC registration, then approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in 2015 to be traded publicly.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Submitted on Tuesday, Grayscale\u2019s SEC filing of Form 10 seeks to register GBTC as an SEC reporting company, which is a first in the cryptocurrency space, per a company statement. Under the new status, the bitcoin trust will be required to file audited financial statements and current reports to announce major updates, in addition to the quarterly and annual reports Grayscale currently publishes for GBTC.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Grayscale managing director Michael Sonnenshein stressed that the filing should not be regarded as a move to turn GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, GBTC under the SEC oversight will have \u201Ca familiar structure to investors because they are modeled after popular investment products,\u201D per the statement. The registered GBTC will disclose more information to investors and have better access to liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, investors who purchase GBTC via private placement have to wait 12 months before reselling it on the secondary market. If the filing is passed, the wait time will be halved to six months, giving investors earlier access to the public market.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Grayscale is hoping that the registered status will help GBTC tap into a pool of institutions that prefer to invest in SEC-registered products.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhile this filing should not be considered as an ETF filing, we do think given the demand we are seeing for GBTC, that by hopefully becoming an SEC reporting company, we are giving investors the level of disclosure and risks and reporting they not only want \u2014 but deserve \u2014and this [Grayscale's filing] is a step in that direction,\u201D said Sonnenshein to The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arguably the most successful cryptocurrency trust product, GBTC, saw a <a href=\"https:\/\/grayscale.co\/insights\/grayscale-q3-2019-digital-asset-investment-report\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">total cumulative inflow<\/a> of $304.4 million for the 12 months ending in September, reaching its monthly all-time-high in July with $171.7 million.

Other asset managers such as VanEck and Bitwise have had similar luck with their bitcoin ETF applications, although the SEC recently decided to revisit its rejection to Bitwise, opening up the possibility for an ETF approval. Meanwhile, Sonnenshein remains optimistic about the regulator's attitude towards cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COur regulators are not only open to the asset class, but they are also very willing to engage with established players like us,\" said Sonnenshein. \"The various filings are moving the industry forward and providing access to the best products in the investment community.\u201D<\/span>"],"hashtag":["SEC"]}
