Kordek confirmed the news to The Block on Friday, saying \u201Cone of the Lisk Foundation\u2019s contractors named Lightcurve laid off the people.\u201D","Lightcurve is a unit of Lisk, co-founded by Kordek and Oliver Beddows - both of them are also co-founders of Lisk. Kordek told The Block that Lightcurve is the Lisk Foundation's main research and development studio and that the foundation is working together with \"other contractors for other reasons,\" but those are \"not founded or managed by Oliver or myself.\" Kordek declined to share more information about those contractors.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe Lisk Foundation, on its part, currently employs 5 persons for operational reasons, Kordek told The Block, adding that the team consists of a managing director, two in accounting and two in legal. The foundation also has a board of three, two of those are Beddows and Kordek himself.&nbsp;","Lightcurve also terminated the contracts of three employees who were yet to join. \u201CThe reasons were to decrease our burn rate which by a large degree consisted of human resources costs, and to decrease our operational overhead in order to become more agile again,\u201D said Kordek on Discord.","The <a href=\"https:\/\/lightcurve.io\/about-us?positions=\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">remaining 32 employees<\/a> of Lightcurve, from research, backend development and developer relations departments, will continue to focus on building the project. \u201CWe are looking forward to the next year. Some exciting things are coming,\u201D said Kordek on Discord, without disclosing details.","Both Lisk and Lightcurve were founded in 2016, while the former is Switzerland-headquartered, the latter is based in Germany. Lisk raised 14,052 bitcoin (currently worth over $100 million) in an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2016. The project's <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/lisk\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LSK token<\/a> is currently priced at $0.65 apiece.","Lisk reportedly<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/lisk-relaunches-blockchain-project-accessibility-mind\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> rebranded<\/a> last year, with \u201Caccessibility\u201D in mind. \u201CIn the beginning, it was really more like a tech project. Now we\u2019re more about enabling people, about giving access to them, because blockchain technology is such an amazing thing. We basically want to distribute it to the people to make it accessible so that everyone can build on it,\u201D Kordek told CoinDesk at the time.","Lightcurve is just one of the latest firms to announce layoffs in recent weeks. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/50171\/another-round-of-lay-offs-sweep-circle-following-announcement-of-cofounders-exit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Circle laid off<\/a> 10 employees earlier this week.
