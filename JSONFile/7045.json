{"summary":"Luna&#x27;s supply increased by nearly 17,000 times in just three days as its mechanism led to a vicious cycle of higher supply and lower prices.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/146762\/luna-supply-soared-to-6-5-trillion-coins-before-terras-latest-halt","publishDate":"2022-05-13T05:48:06","id":7045,"type":null,"title":"Luna supply soared to 6.5 trillion coins before Terra\u2019s latest halt","category":["CRYPTOCURRENCY"],"content":["The circulating supply of Luna (LUNA) surged to more than 6.5 trillion by the time the Terra blockchain was halted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/146722\/terra-says-it-has-halted-blockchain-for-second-time-in-24-hours?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">for a second time<\/a> in an attempt to salvage the collapsing ecosystem.&nbsp;","For the last few weeks \u2014 up until just three days ago \u2014&nbsp;the supply of Luna was only around 340,000, <a href=\"https:\/\/terra.smartstake.io\/history\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to data from<\/a> Terra Analytics.

But once UST lost its peg and investors tried cashing out en masse, the mechanism put a lot of downward pressure on Luna. Worse, the more Luna\u2019s price went down, the greater the downward pressure. This created a vicious cycle that crushed Luna\u2019s price and made its supply accelerate on an exponential scale.","On Tuesday, the network issued 40 million Luna tokens. On Wednesday, the circulating supply of Luna started ramping up and reached 1.5 billion tokens. On Thursday, this reached a new level as it shot up to 176 billion tokens, despite the chain being halted for a short time. It reached 6.5 trillion today and would still be growing had the chain not been halted for a second time.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The supply of Luna is now measured in the trillions.
