Previously, Ordinals inscriptions representing tokens and NFTs on Bitcoin were independent of one another, unaware of other inscriptions. Recursive inscriptions can reference the content of other inscriptions using a special syntax.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Building on this, Luminex claims BRC-69 can reduce the cost of inscriptions by over 90%, helping to optimize the Bitcoin block space as the number of inscriptions grow. The reduction is achieved through a 4-step process of inscribing traits, deploying a collection, compiling it and minting the assets, Luminex <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/luminexio\/thread\/1675832800761778183\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Luminex\u2019s proposal means that minters only need to inscribe a single line of text rather than a full image. This text serves as a reference, allowing the final image to be automatically rendered across Ordinals frontends, only using on-chain resources. \u201CThe end result? A flawlessly rendered image. Unlike other SVG recursive collections, these images can be dragged, dropped and saved as typical image type Ordinals,\u201D Luminex said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In addition to cost savings, Luminex claims BRC-69 paves the way for more enhancements and features. For example, launching collections with a fully on-chain pre-reveal process \u2014 meaning the unveiling of a collection, including the final image and its associated traits, happens directly on the blockchain without requiring off-chain resources.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Ordinals protocol came to prominence <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207086\/what-are-bitcoin-nfts-ordinals-and-how-do-they-work\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">earlier<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> this year, enabling the creation of tokens and NFTs on Bitcoin and causing a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232897\/bitcoin-active-users-fees-and-transactions-had-a-wild-ride-in-may-amid-memecoin-mania\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">surge<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in transactions and fees on the network.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
