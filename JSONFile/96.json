The idea goes: you could put up an NFT worth 10 ETH, for example, and that would enable you to borrow 5 ETH as a loan. And if you don't pay back the loan in time, then you lose the NFT.","That's exactly what happened here.","Around three months ago, an NFT collector borrowed 3.5 ETH (currently worth $12,600) on the NFTfi platform. To make the loan, they put up an \"Elevated Deconstructions\" NFT \u2014 part of the Art Blocks Curated set \u2014 which were selling for about 11 ETH ($39,600) at the time. Although the last sale price for that NFT was 3.25 ETH ($11,700), which was below the value of the loan.","Over that timespan, the value of these NFTs shot up. This was largely triggered by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/punk6529\/status\/1437905960115261444\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">endorsements<\/a> from Punk 6529 (a Twitter account run by the owner of that CryptoPunk) and Cozomo de' Medici, a pseudonymous art collector. Not before long they were selling for 85 - 200 ETH ($306,000 - $720,000).","Yesterday, the 3.5 ETH loan ended and the borrower had not repaid the loan during those three months. As a result, the collateral was passed to the lender, who ended up losing their 3.5 ETH but gaining the Elevated Deconstructions NFT.","The current floor price\u2014 the cheapest available NFT on the market in this collection \u2014 is 95 ETH ($342,000). In theory this puts the lender up about $329,000. Although, despite the high floor price, this doesn't necessarily mean the lender can sell the NFT for this much.","In fact, there hasn't been a sale of an Elevated Deconstructions NFT for 18 days. As a result, it's possible that the borrower chose to forgoe on the loan to get some immediate liquidity. This is unlikely, however, because they could have dropped the NFT price significantly and likely still sold for more than 3.5 ETH.","A curious twist to this story is the fact that this NFT has been put up as collateral twice in its history \u2014 and both times, the borrower has defaulted on it.","","","As the historical data shows, this NFT was part of a loan that was defaulted on in April over a 3 ETH ($10,800) loan, which is how the previous owner obtained it before giving it up over the weekend.","The previous owner has been involved in a couple of other NFT-backed loans. In April, they tasted their first liquidation, receiving an Arago NFT when a 3 ETH loan was not repaid. In May, they had 1 ETH returned (with interest) on a loan they gave out that was backed by a Decentraland parcel of land.","But since they took out the sale at the end of June, they haven't been particularly active.
