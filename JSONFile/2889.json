The plot device works like this \u2014 husband is charged with a crime, allegedly confesses to wife, who refuses to testify against husband based on marital privilege. The basic idea is that one spouse can\u2019t be required to testify against another because as a matter of public policy we believe that marriage is important and we don\u2019t want to discourage spousal communication. In addition to the testimonial privilege, which my hypothetical addressed, the marital privilege can also extend to discovery of communication between spouses \u2014 conversations, text messages, emojis etc. This marital communications privilege is what\u2019s currently at issue in the Tezos class action litigation.","As a part of the discovery process in this case, Plaintiffs sent the defendants a series of document requests. You\u2019ll recall that Kathleen and Arthur Breitman are both defendants in this case and also (as the last name suggests) happen to be married and also happen to be the founders of defendant Dynamic Ledger Services (DLS) and, respectively Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer. In responding to Plaintiffs\u2019 document requests they refused to produce certain documents on the basis of marital communications privilege, which are listed on a privilege log attached to this particular court filing. The documents include subjects such as communications regarding website content, press inquiries, third party inquiries regarding \u201Cfundraiser\u201D and a variety of other communications regarding the business of DLS and Tezos.","Plaintiff took issue with these objections. Defendants stood by them. This joint filing articulates each side's position about the dispute to the Court.","Plaintiffs argue that the communications are \u201Cpurely business communications between business partners that would have occurred\u201D even if they weren\u2019t married, so the privilege doesn\u2019t apply. Also, they aren\u2019t confidential communications, Plaintiff argues, because the emails at issue are between \u201Cwork emails\u201D used by the Breitmans that are owned, controlled and possessed by DLS. Alternatively, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should review the communications at issue \u201Cin camera\u201D to \u201Cdetermine whether such communications were truly induced by the marital relationship or simply business communications between business partners.\u201D","Defendants argue in response that they had \u201Cno reason to believe their emails were not confidential. DLS has no policy banning them from using work email for personal use, and does not give any third parties access to their email accounts.\u201D They also argue that there is no \u201Cbusiness communications\u201D exception to the marital privilege in the 9th circuit and that \u201CIt would be destructive to marital relationships if spouses were forced to disclose such private, confidential communications merely because those communications relate to business matters.\u201D Furthermore, they say that they are not using the privilege to hide business agreements with others or \u201Cconceal facts about their property or business transactions.\u201D","Of course I don\u2019t know how the Court will rule here. On the one hand, there are sound policy reasons for protecting marital communications, which the Breitmans\u2019 lawyers have aptly briefed. On the other hand, highly relevant business communications in which there is no expectation of privacy may be difficult for the court to agree to withhold. While Defendants object to an in camera review, I\u2019d be surprised if the Court didn\u2019t at the very least give the documents a read and make a decision about how relevant they are before ruling. If produced, expect to see them treated as confidential and subject to a protective order that restricts their public production.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
