It aims to make the process of interacting with crypto-assets \u2014 whether that's bitcoin or Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) \u2014 simpler for newcomers to the space.","\u201CWhat we try to achieve is to radically simplify the crypto onboarding use cases and to make many more use cases viable and attractive,\u201D Szymon Sypniewicz, co-founder and CEO of Ramp, told The Block.","A who\u2019s who of angel investors associated with big-name fintech firms also participated in the raise, including former TransferWise CEO Taavet Hinrikus; former Coinbase CTO Balaji S. Srinivasan; Roham Gharegozlou, CEO and founder of Dapper Labs; ComplyAdvantage founder and CEO Charles Delingpole; Anchorage president and co-founder Diogo Monica; Keith Grose, head of international at Plaid; Francesco Simoneschi, CEO and founder at TrueLayer; and Celo founder Rene Reinsberg.","Ramp last raised money in a $1.2 million pre-seed round in 2018 from investors including Fabric Ventures, Firstminute Capital, Seedcamp and MakerDAO.","Ramp\u2019s solution is a non-custodial, full-stack payment infrastructure, which it offers to partners \u2014 such as exchanges, marketplaces and wallet apps \u2014 to help their customers move money from fiat into cryptocurrencies more easily.","Sypniewicz said the \u201Cfirst generation\u201D of crypto technology was built specifically for traders, which puts off newcomers to the space who often have limited trading experience. Ramp, he said, offers an armchair ride by comparison because it \u201Cbuilt the onboarding flow with newcomers and newbies in mind.\u201D","\u201CWe use plain language, we really describe in-depth what\u2019s happening, what\u2019s going on. And we also built this flow to resemble a payment flow or an e-commerce checkout flow. So you basically need to click the \u2018next\u2019 button a couple of times and you\u2019re done with the transaction,\u201D he added. &nbsp;","Ramp is headquartered in London and supervised by the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, but most of its operation is run out of Poland. &nbsp;","Another way in which the business tries to smooth the process of crypto onboarding is by adjusting its identification verification checks, based on the riskiness of a given transaction. A $20 NFT purchase, for example, may only require bank account verification through an Open Banking connection. A large purchase of crypto, on the other hand, may trigger additional requirements such as an ID scan and a proof of funds check.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
