If it is going to facilitate cross border payments, which are very laborious in quite a few corners of our big world, then we should explore it.\u201D","Her remarks come after the ECB announced on October 2 that it would be intensifying its efforts to explore the development of a digital euro \u2013 a so-called Central Bank Digital Currency \u2013 with the launch of a public consultation and experimentation.","The digital euro is envisaged as a complement to cash, rather than as the means to replace it.","The ECB\u2019s Eurosystem High-Level Task Force on central bank digital currency (CBDC) also published a lengthy report on the implications of issuing a digital euro, in which scenarios that would necessitate the issuance of a digital euro were identified.","These scenarios included increased demand for electronic payments in Europe, a significant decline in cash usage, a broad uptake of CBDCs issued by other central banks, and the launch of global private payment initiatives.","The latter scenario appears to refer to Facebook\u2019s proposed stablecoin Libra, which is widely viewed as having accelerated the work being done by central banks. China\u2019s attempt to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/83711\/china-digital-yuan-alipay-wechat-dcep\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">roll out a digital yuan<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> \u2013 which is already undergoing real-world trials \u2013 is seen as another key stimulant for Western governments.<\/span>","The Eurosystem High-Level Task Force on CBDCs was formed in January 2020 and is composed of representatives from more than twenty European central banks, including representatives from the Banque du France, Deutsche Bundesbank and Banco de España.","Speaking at Thursday\u2019s event, Lagarde said that even if the decision is taken to move ahead with the digital euro project, it will not \u201Cbe available right away\u201D. The ECB would still have to assess a range of issues including anti-money laundering and terrorist financing concerns, user privacy and which technology carrier to use, according to Lagarde.","She added that a digital euro launch would likely take between two and four years to come to fruition.","Jerome H. Powell, chair of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, speaking on the same panel as Lagarde, said the US is \u201Ccommitted to carefully and thoughtfully evaluating the potential costs and benefits of a central bank digital currency\u201D.","Doubling down on earlier comments, however, he added that the dollar\u2019s status as the global reserve currency means it is \u201Ccritical that we get it right as opposed to trying to be the first\u201D.","Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, who spoke alongside Powell and Lagarde, issued a telling warning for potential issuers of private stablecoins.","\u201CPeople I think have a right to expect certainty of value in the instrument they use to make payments in,\u201D he said. \u201CI have to say that I think that means that the bar is set very high for private stablecoins, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve met that bar. They haven\u2019t met that bar in my view. And it may be that the answer to that bar is actually central bank digital currency.\u201D","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
