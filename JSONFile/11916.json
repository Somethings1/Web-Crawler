It specifically cites the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s pilot program for a wholesale central bank digital currency aimed at making payments between banks, including cross-border transactions, virtually instantaneous.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The White House document also argues that digital assets are neither an effective store of value, nor an effective means of payment.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere is also tension in an asset being promoted as both money and an investment vehicle,\u201D the report reads. \u201CAs money, the instrument should have a stable value, suggesting limited price volatility. But as a risky asset, it should experience price volatility, for which an investor would be compensated with a high expected return. Holding everything else constant, the riskier an asset is, the less likely it can effectively serve as money.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That includes the prospect of stablecoins becoming a widely adopted payment tool, the report says.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CStablecoin holders that lack redemption rights may be unable to find willing counterparties to exit their stablecoin positions,\u201D reads the document, which echoes a Financial Stability Oversight Council report that singled out Tether and Circle\u2019s USDC. The White House adds that stablecoins are \u201Ctoo risky\u201D to serve a broad payments purpose yet.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The White House appears to have a dim view of distributed ledger technology as a whole, citing arguments that previously existing technology could perform similar functions better, and poking holes in several specific use cases. It also notes the frequent noncompliance in securities and other financial regulatory law, large numbers of scams, and unusual concentration of activities by crypto trading platforms that would be prohibited at an existing exchange.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The White House also blasts proof-of-work mining, arguing that it \"has few, if any, attendant benefits,\u201D for the communities where miners set up while increasing local energy costs and heightening the risk of power crises.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DeFi doesn\u2019t escape the White House\u2019s criticism either.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThough DeFi applications claim to help broaden access to credit by decreasing intermediation fees, they create serious risks to investors and cause at least two risks for the broader financial system: the use of significant leverage, and the performance of regulated functions without compliance with appropriate regulations.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the conclusion of its chapter on digital assets, the White House urges that regulators \u201Cmust apply the lessons that civilization has learned, and thus rely on economic principles, in regulating crypto assets.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Council of Economic Advisers, one of the two main economic policy units within the White House, drafts the annual report, which the president signs off on. Biden in February nominated Jared Bernstein, a current member of that panel and former Obama and Clinton administration official, to become its chair. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whether the criticisms presented in the report reflect a majority opinion in the administration remains to be seen. Lael Brainard, the former Federal Reserve vice chair and new head of the National Economic Council, the other major White House economic policy group, played an active role in the Fed\u2019s CBDC research. <\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
