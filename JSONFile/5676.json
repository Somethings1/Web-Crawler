If the poll remains positive and a forum call goes well, then there will be a snapshot vote for SUSHI holders to decide whether to hire Howard.","If brought on, Howard would be looking after day to day management of operations and leading efforts on delivering both pending and new products at Sushi.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/staringispolite\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Linkedin bio<\/a>, Howard is currently the co-founder and chief technology officer at an NFT-focused firm called BigHeadClub and previously founded tech startups.

SushiSwap's treasury is worth $19.4 million, per DeepDAO.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In terms of token incentives, the Head Chef gets 600,000 SUSHI tokens vested for four years with a six month cliff. Currently, each SUSHI token is worth $1.29.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Head Chef will also receive a one-time bonus of 350,000 SUSHI tokens.
