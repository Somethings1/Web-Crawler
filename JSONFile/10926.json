Under the leadership of Gensler\u2019s Republican predecessor, Jay Clayton, the SEC took a similar stance that almost all tokens are securities under longstanding laws, but said a small number of tokens might cease to be considered securities if they became broadly decentralized.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/speech-hinman-061418\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2018 speech by a senior SEC official<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, speaking on his own views, said that ether had reached a threshold of being decentralized enough that he no longer saw the value in applying securities laws. The official, William Hinman, was willing to set aside whether or not its initial offering, which became a model for the 2017 initial coin offering boom that started greater SEC scrutiny of digital assets, violated the law.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But Gensler has implied that ether, and any other proof-of-stake cryptocurrency, could be considered a security, seeming to disagree with those past views of senior commission officials on the world\u2019s second-largest digital asset.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Further confusing the matter, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam sees <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/218149\/cftc-head-says-stablecoins-are-in-agencys-jurisdiction-without-clear-direction-from-congress\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ether as a commodity<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> falling under his jurisdiction, while New York Attorney General Letitia James <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/218600\/new-york-sues-kucoin-claims-ether-is-an-unregistered-security\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">declared ether an unregistered security<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in an enforcement action taken against the crypto firm KuCoin.<\/span>","Ether isn\u2019t the only crypto topic where the SEC and CFTC seem to disagree. Behnam also told reporters last month that stablecoins fall under his agency\u2019s jurisdiction, absent a new comprehensive regulatory framework made law by Congress and the Biden administration.","Gensler signed off on an administration proposal to create that framework in 2021. But there\u2019s skepticism over whether he and his staff actually <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/225152\/gensler-sec-crypto-stablecoin-congress\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">want a law to be made around stablecoins<\/a>, as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/211214\/sec-action-against-paxos-paints-regulatory-target-on-stablecoins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SEC has asserted jurisdiction<\/a> over those assets as well.","Questioned today by Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., as to whether he wants to see a law made around stablecoins, Gensler gave a qualified yes, with the caveat of, \u201Cnot undermining the $100 trillion capital markets,\u201D later adding that he supports <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174527\/senior-u-s-regulators-propose-new-legislation-increased-rules-around-digital-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recommendations for stablecoin legislation<\/a> made by a regulatory panel led by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.","Gensler also connected last month\u2019s failures of Silvergate and Signature Banks as tied to their business exposure to digital assets, and noted that Circle held $3 billion in reserves for USDC with Silicon Valley Bank.","Several Republicans brought up the agency\u2019s handling of FTX, Silvergate\u2019s most well-known client.","Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., criticized the SEC for not preemptively acting on FTX before Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire failed, citing the one-time multibillion dollar company\u2019s alleged commingling of funds and well-documented accounting issues.","\"A one-time $32 billion company was run on Quickbooks,\" said Barr.","\u201CIf these companies had registered we\u2019d actually be able to look at their books and records,\u201D replied Gensler.","House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a vocal advocate of digital assets, went a step further, yelling at Gensler that, \u201CYou\u2019ve been an incompetent cop on the beat!\u201D and accusing him of intentionally driving the digital asset industry out of the U.S.","\u201CI\u2019m trying to drive it to compliance and if they\u2019re not complying with laws then they shouldn\u2019t be offering their product to investors,\u201D replied Gensler.","Some Democrats also pressed Gensler on his agency\u2019s approach to digital assets, including why the SEC hasn\u2019t prioritized enforcement actions against <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/217075\/sec-staff-believe-binance-us-is-operating-an-unregistered-securities-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">offshore firms like Binance<\/a> and Tether, which cater to U.S. customers but aren\u2019t registered in the U.S., as FTX did from its primary operations in the Bahamas.","\u201CIt seems like your enforcement priorities ignore the lessons learned from the FTX failure,\u201D said Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., noting investigations into U.S. crypto firms like Paxos and Coinbase.","Gensler defended the agency\u2019s enforcement priorities, while acknowledging that offshore firms may illegally do business with U.S. customers, and that the SEC has jurisdiction in those cases.","\u201CIt takes longer to build the investigative files. It takes longer sometimes in cooperation with offshore enforcement authorities to pursue that and it is frankly, more challenging to actually get subpoenas complied with,\u201D if a foreign company is involved, Gensler said.","Digital assets were only one of the topics of Tuesday\u2019s general oversight hearing of the SEC, which also touched on new agency policies on environmental disclosures, SEC staff turnover, and non-crypto agency initiatives.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: This story has been updated with additional information from the hearing.<\/em>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
