However, the flows were still substantially lower than the $10.7 billion witnessed in 2021 and $6.6 billion in 2020.","\u201CMuch of the recovery was in the final quarter where it became increasingly clear that the SEC was warming up to the launch of bitcoin spot-based ETFs in the United States,\u201D Butterfill wrote.","Bitcoin funds were indeed the main benefactor, capturing $1.9 billion of the yearly inflows. This represents some 87% of the total \u2014 the largest percentage to date. The prior peak was 80% in 2020, with the lowest being 42% in 2017.","\u201CThere does not seem to be a discernible trend here, with the most likely cause being hype around an SEC ETF approval,\u201D Butterfill added.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Weekly crypto asset flows.

Blockchain equities also performed well, with inflows of $458 million \u2014 3.6 times higher than in 2022 \u2014 seeing AUM rise by 109% in 2023.","Ether investment products saw a recovery of inflows toward the end of 2023, reaching $78 million. However, this represents just 0.7% of their total AUM. In contrast, Solana products benefitted from investor reluctance on Ether-based funds, according to Butterfill, registering inflows of $167 million in 2023 \u2014 some 20% of their total AUM.","Regionally, the U.S. witnessed the largest inflows in dollar terms, bringing in $792 million. Germany followed with $663 million worth of inflows, and Canada third, registering $543 million. However, looking at the flows as a percentage of AUM in each country paints a different picture. By this metric, U.S. inflows only grew by 2% of AUM, compared to 22% of AUM for Germany and 15% for Canada.","\u201CThe U.S. lagging is perhaps understandable given the likely preference amongst investors for a spot-based ETF,\u201D Butterfill said.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
