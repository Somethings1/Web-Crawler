Meanwhile, ether\u2019s daily trading volumes have consistently outpaced BTC's.","","","Bitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour as the two indicators are closing in on each other, a bearish signal for market technicians. ","","","BTC\u2019s price slid from $37,833 at 01:00 UTC (9 p.m. ET Monday) to as low as $35,816 by 17:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. ET) Tuesday, a 5.3% tumble based on CoinDesk 20 data, before rising to $35,987 as of press time.","","","\u201CBitcoin is newly oversold from an intermediate-term perspective,\u201D said technical analyst Katie Stockton in her weekly Fairlead Strategies investor note.","","","The past weekend saw the lowest number of bitcoin transfers from exchanges in 2021. On Sunday, May 30, the flow bottomed out at 33,393 daily transfers, according to data aggregator Glassnode. It\u2019s the first time this year fewer than 35,000 transfers were made from exchanges in a day.","","","In contrast is the high transfer volume to exchanges in the past month, particularly on May 19, when each transaction that day averaged 2 BTC. That\u2019s triple the daily average per transaction of 0.67 BTC so far in 2021.","","","This Glassnode on-chain information supports Stockton\u2019s oversold theory in the bitcoin market because it appears holders moved BTC to exchanges and sold it, leading to a record-low outflow Sunday.","",""," \u201CIntermediate-term momentum is to the downside, giving way to another lower high within the corrective phase,\u201D added Stockton. \u201CSupport is initially near $34,000.\u201D","","","Read More: Bitcoin\u2019s Long-Term Put Options See Sustained Demand","","","The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,549 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 3.2% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average but above the 50-hour, a flat or sideways signal for market technicians. ","","","Ether dipped from $2,734 at 22:00 UTC 01:00 UTC (9 p.m. ET Monday) to $2,532 by 17:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. ET) Tuesday, a 7.3% fall based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has since gone up slightly, at $2,549 as of press time.  ","","","\u201CEther has seen a sharp correction like bitcoin,\u201D said Fairlead\u2019s Stockton. \u201CIntermediate-term momentum has deteriorated. Support is intact near $2,038 on a consecutive closing basis.\u201D","","","While bitcoin\u2019s 90-day volatility has been, well, volatile over the past three months, ether\u2019s has been even more so. According to data from CoinDesk Research, both assets\u2019 volatility bottomed out in mid-April but ETH\u2019s gyrations are now over 170% while BTC still sits below 100%. ","","","\u201CYeah, really choppy days,\u201D said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank. \u201CEther is naturally a more volatile asset than bitcoin as it is less institutionalized and has a smaller market cap. It therefore acts much like a stock with a higher beta than the market index.\u201D","","","One of the reasons for ETH\u2019s price resiliency might be because its trading volume is starting to go higher than BTC on most days, giving it increased liquidity. ","","","\u201CIn the last couple of days ETH and BTC have both been declining at similar percentage rates,\u201D said John Willock, CEO of crypto custody provider Tritum. \u201CBut ETH overall has fared and recovered most of its lost value much better after the last couple of weekends of market volatility.\u201D","","","Based on the latest available data from CoinGecko, ETH volumes were at $43 million on Monday while $37 million BTC changed hands on major spot trading venues.","","","Over the past month, ether trading volumes have been higher than bitcoin's for 12 total days. Over the past week, ETH volumes have been higher than BTC for four days. This is a trend analysts will be watching closely because higher volumes can affect prices when they skew towards either buys or sells. ","","","\u201CETH is quickly becoming recognized as an exciting asset as a standalone,\u201D Willock said. ","","","Read More: Lithium Raises $5M for Decentralized Oracle Tracking Private Assets","","","Fairlead\u2019s Stockton thinks the weeks ahead for crypto may be a time for traders to \u201Crisk-on.\u201D This is a term for bullish market positioning, anticipating the next short-term upward cycle. ","","","\u201CThe takeaway is for a shift toward risk-on positioning for the next week or two,\u201D Stockton said. ","","","Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Tuesday.
