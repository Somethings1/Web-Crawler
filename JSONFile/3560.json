The malicious actors are now sending direct messages to individuals, specifically targeting those with known .eth addresses, falsely warning them of a compromise,\" Dave Schwed, COO at blockchain security firm Halborn told The Block. \"They then guide these individuals to a fake site that mimics ScamSniffer, but with a different top-level domain (TLD) name. Once users 'scan' their address on this fraudulent site, a fabricated compromise is reported. When unsuspecting users connect their wallets and attempt to 'revoke' permissions, they inadvertently grant scammers access to their tokens.\"","\"This isn't a technologically sophisticated attack, but rather a social engineering tactic. It capitalizes on the trust inspired by Nelly's significant follower count and a deceptive website resembling a genuine one. A simple Google search for the authentic ScamSniffer site would reveal the discrepancy in top-level domains (TLD).\" Schwed added.","Representatives for Nelly did not return a request for comment from The Block.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with comments from the COO of Halborn.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
