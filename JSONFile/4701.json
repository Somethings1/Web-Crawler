Speaking to Rastislav Vašička, CIO of Core said, \"Goldilocks is popular for its solid performance and security. The ED448 encryption technology allows the Core Blockchain Network to execute transactions with the highest security standards, confirming transactions in around 42 seconds, an ideal network for transacting due to the implementation of banking standards.\" With mining on almost any IoT device at only 6 watts per hour, Core is not only the most affordable fully decentralized proof-of-work blockchain in the world, it is also truly environmentally friendly. \"In short, we can unquestionably say that the Core Blockchain Network is currently the fastest, safest and most affordable, truly scalable decentralized blockchain in the world\" Michael Loubser, Core Decentralized Technologies, Chairman.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The fast, economical and secure scalable Core Blockchain technology will be the backbone of Core Decentralized Technologies, an entire ecosystem of blockchain based solutions and applications that facilitate effective transacting, data processing and information flow across organizations.
