Decentralized exchanges would become the venue of choice to raise capital and trade the tokens rather than traditional centralized exchanges, he added.&nbsp;\u201CA DEX is naturally suited to support the trading of any type of equity, debt, utility, participation, etc. token issued by an AI-powered DAO,\u201D Hayes said, and will \u201Clikely become natural monopolies,\u201D dominating the trading of various DAO-issued tokens.","He added that investors would also have access to the financial performance of DAOs in real-time, eliminating the need for auditors and third-party intermediaries.","Hayes believes the future AI-powered economy will grow into a market of trillions of dollars within the next decade. As AI DAOs emerge, the demand for blockchains, like Ethereum, will skyrocket, leading to a surge in the price of their native tokens.&nbsp;\u201CEthereum transactions will grow exponentially as DAOs proliferate. As a result, the price of ETH should skyrocket in anticipation if this AI DAO hypothesis is widely believed,\u201D Hayes said.","\u201CI\u2019m a bit of an ETH maxi when it comes to needing actual utility on a Layer-1,\u201D he added. \u201CWhile investors might make money trading the latest hyped Ethereum clone, none of them will ever eclipse Ethereum in terms of adoption and usefulness.\"","Summing up how he intends to profit from his hypothesis, \u201CEthereum jig jig boom,\u201D Hayes said.","On Wednesday, The Block reported Hayes\u2019 family office, Maelstrom, had participated in a Pre-A funding round for Aethir, a decentralized cloud network for gaming and AI, at a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241498\/arthur-hayes-maelstrom-aethir\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$150 million<\/a> valuation.","Earlier this month, Hayes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238311\/bitcoin-ai-currency-arthur-hayes\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> bitcoin would be the currency of artificial intelligence, with its digital, uncensorable and scarce properties being ideal for an AI-driven future.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
