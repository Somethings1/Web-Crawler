Depending on how many tokens customers have, they can do a certain amount of free trading every 30 days. The major difference between FOX tokens and Binance\u2019s tokens, Voorhees explains, is that with ShapeShift, customers do not lose their tokens when they take in the benefits.","The move by ShapeShift echoes the price consolidation that has swept U.S. brokers. <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/etf\/commission-free-etfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vanguard<\/a> has endorsed free exchange-traded fund (ETF) trades for a while and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fidelity.com\/mutual-funds\/investing-ideas\/index-funds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fidelity<\/a> offers zero-commission index funds and ETFs. Last month, a few big-name brokerages including Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2019\/10\/01\/investing\/charles-schwab-eliminates-commissions\/index.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> that they were to get rid of commissions on online stock and ETF trading.","ShapeShift does not believe that dropping fees will hurt their revenues, Voorhees said. Besides revenues coming from fees paid by users who do not hold FOX tokens, ShapeShift also plans on selling its tokens to new customers in exchange for perpetual free trading service if the model becomes a success.","He anticipates a 30% surge in trading accounts as a result of this move.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Is crypto heading to a non-custodial future?<\/strong>","Non-custodial exchanges allow for a higher degree of anonymity and security. It does not require accounts for trading and is a convenient alternative for people who want to make a quick trade or are reluctant to entrust an exchange with personal information.","\u201CSo far, non-custodial exchanges have low liquidity, bad prices, or both,\u201D Voorhees said. ShapeShift aims to solve both problems by offering high liquidity and zero trade fees. &nbsp;","\u201CI think self-custody is where the crypto industry is heading to in the long term,\u201D he added.","But ShapeShift does not have plans to transition into a completely decentralized platform, an open-source, permissionless on-chain platform where users use smart contracts on the Ethereum network to trade tokens. &nbsp;Branding itself as an \u201Cexchange-agnostic\u201D platform, ShapeShift does not wish to constrain itself to a network that is used almost exclusively to trade Ethereum tokens, according to Voorhees.","\u201COur target audience is a normal crypto user who has several kinds of assets and want a safe way to hold and trade them,\u201D he said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
