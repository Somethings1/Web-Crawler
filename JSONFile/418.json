In addition there was a 12% increase in ownership among respondents who earned between $30,000 and $69,900 CAD (roughly $21,600 to $50,380 USD), up from 5% in 2020.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In terms of relative awareness, Bitcoin remains a commonly known term, and 90% of respondents said they had heard of the digital currency, matching figures from previous years.
