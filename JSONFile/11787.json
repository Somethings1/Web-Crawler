We believe it will require Congress to enact legislation to establish the framework for how tokens will be regulated, what type of disclosures will be required and which agency will be in charge of investor protections,\" TD Cowen said. \"Our view remains that Gensler sees enforcement actions and litigation as aiding that process by narrowing the issues that Congress must resolve.\"","Gensler's term ends in June 2026, and he could maintain a Democratic majority at the SEC until then, according to TD Cowen. \"It is yet another reason we believe Gensler is in no hurry to act,\" the bank said, adding that he has time to bring more cases and await more court rulings rather than trying to rush legislative action.","\"This also lets the U.S. learn from other jurisdictions before enacting a regulatory regime that will be tough to change once adopted,\" the bank concluded.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
