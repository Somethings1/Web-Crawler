Still, the largest token by market value is likely to become more dominant in the crypto market, according to one analyst.","As of the time of writing, bitcoin changed hands at $63,200, representing an 11% monthly loss, the first since August 2023, according to data source CoinDesk and TradingView. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the most liquid digital assets, traded nearly 20% lower for the month at 2,185 points.","A bevy of factors like the dwindling probability of the Fed rate cuts, reduced demand for the U.S.-based spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and broad-based risk aversion in financial markets have taken the wind out of the bitcoin bull run this month. Meanwhile, a continued expansion of prominent stablecoins has been a supportive factor.","Analysts are now closely watching Wednesday\u2019s quarterly refunding statement by the U.S. Treasury. According to Singapore-based QCP Capital, a higher issuance of short-term bills could free up liquidity, supporting risk assets.","\u201CThe upcoming Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA) on May 1 could also see higher issuances of short-term U.S. bills. This will drain the RRP, which currently has USD 400 billion, and also increase liquidity,\u201D QCP said in a market note.","The U.S. Treasury said on Monday it plans to borrow more in the April to June quarter. Higher-than-expected borrowing means more bond supply, higher yields or risk-free rates and less reason to invest in risky assets.","The Treasury also said it expects to maintain a balance of $850 billion in its Treasury General Account by the end of September, slightly higher than the $750 billion expected.","Bitcoin\u2019s dominance rate, or the share in the crypto market, recently rose to a three-year high of 57%, breaking higher from a six-month consolidation pattern.","The breakout means bitcoin could continue to outshine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) in the coming months.","\u201CIt [the dominance rate] recently had a breakout favoring bitcoin over altcoins in the intermediate-term, which is in line with the weekly RRG [relative rotation graph] where most altcoins point lower,\u201D Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients Monday.","\u201CThe breakout in the index marks a continuation of a long-term turnaround phase, which has reversed much of the altcoin gains made in early 2021,\u201D Fairlead Strategies added.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$63,200","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"TradingView","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fairlead Strategies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"57%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Treasury General Account","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$850 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"400 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"RRP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"11%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$750 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"QCP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Markets","Dominance rate"],"authors":["Omkar Godbole"]}
