When the stablecoin was launched, it was collateralized fully by USDC, but as it expanded, it used the algorithmic elements to maintain its peg to the dollar.","It was always an idea that the project would consider other coins as collateral. The project\u2019s documentation states that non-stable cryptocurrencies like ether and bitcoin could be added as collateral once the system becomes more robust. Yet only recent has this plan to establish another \u201Cstability fund\u201D made of various crypto assets been discussed as an imminent possibility.","Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian told The Block that such a multi-chain approach for acquiring collateral backing will incentivize the flow of FRAX-denominated transactions on these blockchains. According to Kazemian, the system will contribute to a significant corresponding demand for the native tokens of these Layer 1 chains.","\u201CKeep in mind, this strategy means every L1 chain (including BTC\/lightning) will have an incentive to have FRAX stablecoins flowing through their economy as that creates a central bank-size market demand for their L1 token,\u201D said Kazemian.","Frax intends to acquire the native assets of all blockchains where the stablecoin has been issued.&nbsp;While FRAX's largest presence is on Ethereum, it also trades on 12 other blockchains including Avalanche, BNB Chain, Fantom, Harmony, Polygon, and Solana, along with Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/total-crypto-backed-and-algorithmic-stablecoin-supply\/embed\" title=\"Total Crypto-backed and Algorithmic Stablecoin Supply\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","According to Kazemian, this chain-agnostic collateral acquisition will be proportional to the demand for the FRAX stablecoin across these networks. Thus, FRAX\u2019s balance sheet will reflect the proportion of the stablecoin\u2019s supply in each network.","The stablecoin may set aside a portion of the seigniorage \u2014 the protocol\u2019s revenue generated from issuing FRAX \u2014 to accumulate the assets. The details have, however, yet to be finalized and may go through a governance vote first.","Besides going multi-chain, Frax Finance will take a route different from Terra\u2019s manual Bitcoin purchases.","Terra has been buying bitcoin either by exchanging USDT or burning excess LUNA supply in exchange for BTC. Frax will, instead, utilize its Flaxswap platform to execute these large purchase orders on-chain. Fraxswap is a decentralized exchange designed to allow the execution of large-size orders at minimal slippage. This design feature is especially useful for Frax if it goes ahead to acquire a large volume of major cryptocurrencies over a long time.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
