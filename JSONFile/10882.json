However, Coinbase has not provided a specific timeline for this transition.","\"We\u2019re excited to see OP Labs and other contributors to the OP Stack making fast progress on key decentralization goals, most notably fault proofs. We're working closely with these teams to ensure that Base adopts these improvements as soon as they are ready,\" said Coinbase protocols lead Jesse Pollak.","The team's efforts include contributions to the OP Stack, the creation of OP chains like Base and the ecosystem known as the \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236277\/optimism-changes-name-to-op-mainnet-in-line-with-superchain-vision\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Superchain<\/a>.\u201D It is also one of the main contributors to OP-geth, the first client for the OP Stack, and is working with Paradigm on another client OP-reth \u2014 aiming for fault-proof diversity and minimizing network failure risks.","Finally, the Base team plans to assist in forming a \"security council\" for the Superchain, aimed at implementing further checks and balances to augment the security and decentralization of Base, OP Mainnet and related chains.","Â© 2023 The Block.
