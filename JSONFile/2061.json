The product will also give institutions exposure to staking services.","\u201CThere\u2019s a lot in the world of traditional finance that can be moved to digital assets,\u201D said Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody, in a statement. \u201CThe challenge is how to bring some of the benefits to the world in a safe, compliant and regulatory-first way. Our first such partnership with OpenEden is exactly how we do this \u2014 by bringing access to yield products to our clients.\u201D","Zodia Custody was first unveiled by Standard Chartered and Northern Trust, the asset servicing firm, in 2021.
