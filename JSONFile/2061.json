Such moves could change the face of Libra over time if central banks move to launch such initiatives.","As the paper notes:","\"Indeed, as the prospect of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) becomes a reality, the expectation that the Libra payment system will be capable of being upgraded to support these public sector innovations is a design principle we aim to deliver,\" the paper further adds.","Among the changes being enacted, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/davidmarcus\/status\/1250786162232320003\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to Marcus<\/a>, is \"replacing the originally planned transition to a permissionless form of governance to a market-driven open and competitive network.\"&nbsp;","Libra will also sport \"a comprehensive network-level system around anti-money laundering (AML), Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and sanctions enforcement\" and \"building stronger protections into the design of the Libra Reserve to protect consumers, even in the most adverse situations.\"","On this point, the white paper explains: \"In the first Libra white paper, we announced a path to eventually transitioning the network to a permissionless system.
