This vulnerability led to significant outflows across various associated pools, amounting to over $26 million.&nbsp;","According to security analysts at Beosin, the attacker targeted Curve's factory pools of multiple projects: JPEGd, Metronome and Alchemix.","JPEGd\u2019s pETH-ETH factory pool on Curve saw an outflow of $11.4 million. Following closely, the Metronome\u2019s sETH-ETH pool saw a movement of $1.6 million. However, it was the Alchemix\u2019s alETH-ETH pool that witnessed the most significant activity, with a substantial $13.6 million being transacted.&nbsp;","So far, overall asset outflows related to this security incident on Curve pools have crossed <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1gUi7Nxs6V4wHKUMfSq85d2ShFW3fsMfggKIEV846ROQ\/edit#gid=0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$41 million<\/a>, according to estimates from security firm BlockSec.","Curve Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) optimized for efficient stablecoin trading. Over time, it has expanded its offerings to cater to other types of assets. Factory pools describe a system where new liquidity pools can be created using a standardized framework or \u201Cfactory.\u201D Instead of the Curve team manually creating each pool, this system offers a more permissionless approach, enabling projects or individuals to launch their own liquidity pools leveraging Curve\u2019s infrastructure.","Today\u2019s outflows involved a sequence of interactions. They began with a flashloan, which appeared to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability associated with certain older compiler versions of Vyper \u2013 the smart contract programming language used to write the code for these factory pools, as explained by Igor Igamberdiev, the head of research at Wintermute.&nbsp;","Vyper has <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vyperlang\/status\/1685692973051498497\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acknowledged<\/a> that its versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0 are vulnerable to malfunctioning reentrancy locks, with investigations ongoing.","While the immediate reaction was dominated by concerns of a massive security breach, on-chain data suggests that MEV bots might have front-run some of these transactions. This has led to speculation that whitehat hackers could be involved.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
