And Robinhood's long-asked-for crypto wallet, announced in September, may not launch until next year.&nbsp;","\"We are actively rolling out the alpha and we have a small group of customers, about five to 10 people, who are going to be actively working with us through the last <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pieces of the customer experience,\" Brown said.<\/span>","As for new listings, Brown said the firm is taking a \"safety-first approach,\" indicating the firm won't add new coins anytime soon.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We only have seven coins on our platform.
