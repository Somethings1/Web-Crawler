In short, the seed phrases were unknowingly leaked to the third party Mixpanel, an analytics service, when users chose email\/SMS as the seed phrase recovery method. This means users\u2019 seed phrases are stored into Mixpanel\u2019s server,\" Hacxyk said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As a security measure, the NEAR Protocol said it no longer allows users to create accounts using email or SMS for account recovery. It also advised users who had previously used email or SMS recovery options with their NEAR wallet to \"rotate their keys\" or add a hardware wallet, such as Ledger.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Per Hacxyk, the wallet account model for NEAR wallets is slightly different from Ethereum. A crypto account can have multiple keysets with different permissions. By rotating private keys, NEAR is telling users to revoke the potentially leaked keysets, and add fresh ones to replace them.<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A NEAR Protocol co-founder did not immediately respond to The Block's request for comment.<\/span><\/i>","Â© 2023 The Block.
