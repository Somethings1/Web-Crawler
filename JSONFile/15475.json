But that's a good thing.","\u201CBitcoin\u2019s going to be the boring old grandpa right now in the room,\u201D Safai told CoinDesk TV\u2019s \u201CFirst Mover\u201D on Friday referring to why, during these uncertain economic times, bitcoin\u2019s rally may be due to its simple, more familiar story.","Certainly a lot of the excitement in the crypto market is happening in ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, he noted.","On Wednesday Ethereum underwent its Shanghai upgrade, also known as Shapella. The blockchain\u2019s upgrade raised questions about whether there would be major sell-offs. Instead, ETH's price inched above $2,000 two days after the long anticipated upgrade, beating out bitcoin in options trading, for the first time this year.","While the upgrade allows users to withdraw the ETH they\u2019ve staked (as well as reducing fees and opening space on the blockchain for more transactions), Safai pointed out that \u201Ca lot of things are happening\u201D with ether, including allegations from U.S. government officials who say it is a security and should be regulated as such.","Bitcoin, on the other hand, is sidestepping the \u201Cchaos of all the investigations,\u201D he said. For now, at least, it appears the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is comfortable with treating bitcoin as a commodity, unlike its view of ether.","With Ethereum\u2019s upgrade, the \u201Crules of the game have just changed,\u201D Safai said. It may also be the reason there is excitement in the markets from users.","\u201CWe\u2019re seeing more activity on the options side and I expect that to continue,\u201D he said.","Read more: Ether Options Trading Volume Surpasses Bitcoin As Shanghai Upgrade Drives Demand for Bullish Bets"],"entity":[{"type":"Ether Options Trading Volume Surpasses Bitcoin As Shanghai Upgrade Drives Demand","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dexterity Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Safai","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shapella","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michael Safai","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["ETH","Shanghai","Shapella","Bitcoin","Options insights","Dexterity Capital","Michael Safai"],"authors":["Fran Velasquez"]}
