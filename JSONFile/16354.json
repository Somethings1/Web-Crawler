Binance's Changpeng Zhao stepped down and pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering requirements, despite the fact that Binance was never a U.S. exchange. With that, the myth of \u201Cborderless\u201D crypto companies is truly over.","To be sure, this is not the first time that U.S. law enforcement nailed a crypto exchange that was not officially in the country. The same thing happened with FTX. But no company exemplified the \u201Cborderless\u201D myth more than Binance, which will also pay a $4.3 billion dollar fine to settle an investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice.","Binance defied the boundaries of a traditional company. It served traders everywhere, eventually becoming the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and yet for a long time no one seemed to know where it was located. The very idea of a headquarters was antithetical to Binance\u2019s whole identity.","In 2018, I asked CZ where he was based. \u201CPeople still have this really strong concept of where your company is, and where you are,\u201D he told me at the time. \u201CA company is a concept. An organization is a concept.\u201D When I asked where he called home, he just said, \u201CI don\u2019t really have any answer to that. Earth?\u201D","Binance made a point of not being based in the United States, outside of its much smaller U.S. entity, Binance.US. I can\u2019t remember the last time CZ publicly appeared on American soil. But the company was clearly not exempt from U.S. law. The United States accused Binance of not having a proper anti-money laundering (AML) program, of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and of violating sanctions law, CoinDesk reported.","\u201CBinance became the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed \u2014 now it\u2019s paying one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history,\u201D Attorney General Merrick Garland said.","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have also taken enforcement actions against Binance. The overall theme of the allegations is that Binance had U.S. customers, told those customers how to avoid U.S. regulations and took steps to hide their activity from U.S. regulators.","Some in the crypto community criticize the long arm of U.S. law. Binance itself pushed back against the CFTC in a filing in a U.S. court, saying, \u201CU.S. law governs domestically but does not control the world.\u201D","U.S. law might disagree. In 2022, BitMEX founders pled guilty to violating U.S, anti-money laundering laws, even though BitMEX was based in the Seychelles. And then, of course, came FTX. FTX was based in Hong Kong and then moved to the Bahamas. Sam Bankman-Fried desperately wanted to make it in the United States, paying huge sums of money for celebrity endorsements and stadium naming rights, all while trying to woo politicians in Washington. In the end, FTX\u2019s global operation never made it into the U.S., with the exception of the much smaller and less powerful FTX.US. Instead, Bankman-Fried ended up getting torn apart by U.S. prosecutors in a U.S. court.","The U.S. still has allure for crypto businesses. Despite the pull of dynamic regions such as Asia or the Middle East, it\u2019s hard to avoid the U.S. Did an overseas exchange have U.S. users? Did it mislead U.S. investors? Or did the CEO have meetings in the United States?","\u201CThe burden for venue is not very high,\u201D Samson Enzer, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor, told the Wall Street Journal last year. \u201CThe government would argue that if a single email went through New York, that would suffice.\u201D","We probably will never see another company quite like Binance. Crypto itself might be borderless, but crypto companies may find it increasingly hard to operate outside of legal or geographical boundaries. In the early days of crypto, it seemed possible to launch a massive exchange that slipped through the grasp of any jurisdiction. Those days are gone.","Edited by Marc Hochstein, Nikhilesh De and Ben Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ben Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S. Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Marc Hochstein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Samson Enzer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Manhattan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Middle East","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Seychelles","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4.3 billion dollar","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Merrick Garland","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bahamas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Opinion"],"authors":["Emily Parker"]}
