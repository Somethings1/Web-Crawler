Organizations must perform a Data Protection Impact Assessment if they are involved in processing high-risk biometric data, according to the ICO. Should the risks identified be too high to mitigate, consultation with the ICO becomes mandatory.&nbsp;","\u201COrganizations must conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment before starting any processing that is likely to result in high risk, such as processing special category biometric data. Where they identify high risks that they cannot mitigate, they must consult the ICO,\u201D the regulator added.","Additionally, a clear lawful basis for personal data processing is required in the UK \u2014 with freely given consent being vital.","\u201COrganizations also need to have a clear lawful basis to process personal data. Where they are relying on consent, this needs to be freely given and capable of being withdrawn without detriment,\u201D the ICO said.","Worldcoin said it complies with local laws, including Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation incorporated into UK law following Brexit.&nbsp;","\u201CThe Worldcoin Foundation, and its contributor Tools for Humanity, adhere to the strictest privacy guidelines and requirements in the markets where Worldcoin is available and in select communities we are continuing to assess local laws and regulations to ensure compliance,\u201D Worldcoin told The Block.&nbsp;&nbsp;","\u201CWith regard to GDPR, Worldcoin is fully compliant with all laws and regulations governing biometric data collection and data transfer, including Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. In the European Union, Tools for Humanity is under the supervision of the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision,\u201D it added.","According to Worldcoin\u2019s website FAQs, \u201CWorldcoin never collects any biometric data from any user without that user\u2019s explicit consent.\u201D&nbsp;The page also states that no personal data needs to be shared for a user to download its World App, and any personal data shared with Worldcoin is encrypted in transit and at rest.","\u201CIndividuals who want to receive a World ID are not required to share their name, phone number, email address or home address,\u201D the page states.","\u201CImages collected by the orb are used to generate a unique iris code. By default, these images are immediately deleted once the iris code is created, unless the user opts into data custody,\u201D the project says. \u201COpting into data custody will decrease the probability and frequency of the user\u2019s need to reverify their World ID as the iris code algorithms change. The World ID sign-up process is only intended to verify an individual\u2019s uniqueness,\u201D it added.","\u201CWorldcoin users may choose to share additional data, but this is never required. Importantly, the Worldcoin Foundation and its initial contributor Tools for Humanity do not, and never will, sell anyone\u2019s personal data, including biometric data,\u201D the page adds.","Worldcoin <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241074\/sam-altman-worldcoin-launches-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> its WLD token yesterday, which will be distributed to over two million people globally who have verified their identities via the iris-scanning orbs.

Additionally, tokens can be reserved on the World App until users can visit an orb. However, Worldcoin has been careful to stress that the tokens will not be available in the U.S.","The token launch follows Worldcoin's migration to the OP Mainnet, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, last week. It will distribute a total supply of 10 billion WLD tokens, with 80% reserved for users, operators and the ecosystem. The remaining 20% is set aside for the Worldcoin team and its backers, according to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241074\/sam-altman-worldcoin-launches-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">investor deck<\/a>.","The WLD token initially surged <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241081\/worldcoins-wld-token-surges-88-after-listing-on-multiple-exchanges\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">88%<\/a> on launch, following exchange listings from Binance, Huobi, Bybit and OKX.
