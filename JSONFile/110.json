The crypto industry serves unique challenges like the identification of multichain protocols, interpretation and categorization of on-chain investments, exclusion of \u2018web3\u2019 companies in which blockchain only contributes as a buzzword, etc. Tackling these issues requires a more nuanced crypto-native understanding.
