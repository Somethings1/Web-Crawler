It aims to potentially reduce gas fees for these projects, which are part of Polygon 2.0, which purports to be an ecosystem of Layer 2 chains capable of interacting with one another.","Layer 2 networks developed on Polygon\u2019s CDK employ zero-knowledge rollup technology. They aggregate transactions off-chain and finalize them in bundles on the mainnet. However, these chains necessitate verifying data availability, which means ensuring every network member can securely retrieve and confirm off-chain stored data.","A challenge arises as Ethereum, the network these chains often rely on, lacks a dedicated execution environment for its DA layer. As a result, Ethereum nodes must process and store data on-chain indefinitely, contributing to increased fees for Layer 2 solutions. This is where data availability solutions may come in.","Celestia\u2019s strategy involves its own data availability solution that can serve storage bandwidth for multiple Layer 2 networks simultaneously. By enabling networks to run light nodes, this solution facilitates DA verification without imposing excessive strain on the network.&nbsp;","\u201CCombined with interoperability and unified liquidity provided by Polygon 2.0, Celestia\u2019s out-of-the-box solution will make creating new L2 chains as simple and affordable as deploying a smart contract,\u201D said Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon.","Unlike monolithic Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, Celestia aims to be a modular network. Its architecture is designed so that nodes will reach consensus on transactions in parallel across chains, executed in an off-chain manner.","In October 2022, Celestia Labs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177841\/celestia-labs-hits-unicorn-status-in-latest-bet-on-modular-blockchains\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> $55 million at a valuation exceeding $1 billion in a funding round led by Bain Capital and Polychain.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
