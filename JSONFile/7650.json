Not to pass a legislative vehicle that undermines these time-tested important thoughts,\" Gensler said of securities laws.&nbsp;","Gensler alluded in all but name to the role of FTX CEO Samuel Bankman-Fried in promoting that legislation, particularly the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/184436\/bankman-frieds-priority-crypto-bill-dead-after-ftx-sells-to-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Digital Commodity Consumer Protection Act<\/a> currently with the Senate Agriculture Committee.&nbsp;","\u201CThere\u2019s some legislation on the Hill I do not think meets the test,\" he said. \"I think it undermines the securities laws. Just to note, some of that legislation was promoted by some of the same folks that failed in the last day or two. And you sort of wonder why. Because it was too light touch. So we\u2019re going to continue what we\u2019re doing.\u201D","That legislation reserves greater authorities over crypto markets for the Commodity Future Trading Commission, the U.S.'s other markets regulator, which Gensler chaired during the Obama administration. \u201CAs much admiration as I have for our sibling agency, this is the agency, our agency, that looks after our securities,\u201D he said.&nbsp;","&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
