Check sizes will be anywhere between $250,000 to $1 million, with the funds being deployed over the course of three years, Ramakrishnan said. About a third of the cash is reserved for follow-on investments.&nbsp;","With crypto enduring such a tough year in 2022, culminating in FTX filing for bankruptcy in November, Escape Velocity's founders were pleased not to lose any commitments following the exchange giant's implosion.&nbsp;","\"A lot of people are looking for some degree of validation that crypto was still an interesting idea, that all of this wasn't going to go to zero or fall apart,\" Ramakrishnan said. \"That's really where we were able to add a bit of differentiation because I think we tend to be really, really deep at the core of the networks that we're investing in.\"","The fund has already made five investments, including Xnet and Andrena. Ramakrishnan listed Ribbit Capital and Framework as venture firms they aspire to copy.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This story has been updated to include Ribbit Capital and Multicoin as backers.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
