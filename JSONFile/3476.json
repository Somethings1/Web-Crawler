No one responded as they tried desperately, like so many others, to get their money off of FTX as it imploded.","\u201CIt was just full blown panic mode,\u201D said the former Alamada Research engineer and founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coral.community\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coral<\/a>, a crypto infrastructure company. \u201CIt was like we were punched in the gut \u2026 We were just trying to stay as positive as possible and keep the team motivated and not freaking out, especially because a lot of us lost personal capital as well.\u201D","Coral lost the entirety of FTX\u2019s investment on the exchange, about $14.5 million.

We're here and we're still going.\u201D","Even without the funds, Coral has succeeded in getting the xNFT protocol live and on Solana and its wallet, Backpack, on Solana and Ethereum and available for download in beta form.","Backpack will join a market already brimming with wallets.
