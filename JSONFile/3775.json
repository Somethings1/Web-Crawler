Hingston also pointed out that, as of last year, AWS has allowed traders and venues to share an EC2 Cluster Placement, meaning their servers are located as close to each other as is physically possible within AWS facilities, minimizing the time it takes to insert and cancel orders.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COverall, cloud providers are becoming more aware of the benefits of working with HFT traders in crypto markets,\u201D Hingston said. \u201CAs a result, they are willing to customize solutions or host deep dive sessions that help traders understand how to get the best possible latency on their connections to exchanges.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A spokesperson for AWS declined to comment on these services.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For Hingston, lower latency systems allow traders to provide more competitive quotes, which will in turn narrow spreads. \u201CIt not only contributes to improved price discovery but also enhances market efficiency, ultimately reducing the overall cost of trading for all participants,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Some trading firms appear more concerned about the ways speed mismatches may disadvantage them, however.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jordi Alexander, CIO of Selini Capital, said, \u201CAs a HFT market-making firm trying to provide deep liquidity, we ideally are looking for venues to provide a level-playing field when it comes to latency. This allows us to protect ourselves from toxic taking flow, and thus be able to quote large limit orders without constantly getting picked off.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alexander said a toxic trading environment can emerge in two ways. The first is the result of networking.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CGiven most of the price discovery is happening in large hubs, especially Tokyo AWS, if the exchange matching engine is in a geographical location that gives 1 or 2 firms a specific networking advantage due to their private microwave routing, that creates toxicity. For example, if the venue is in London, if someone has a unique link for Tokyo-London that can overwhelm competitors,\u201D he said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alexander\u2019s second example concerns exchanges giving certain players direct access to their trading engine. \u201CIf a firm that does a lot of liquidity removal is given advantageous access, that can imbalance the equilibrium and result in worse execution possible for everyone as the liquidity provided is having to be more defensive,\u201D he said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Debates over how to balance traders\u2019 demand for premium speeds with a fair market structure are not new, nor are they unique to crypto.
