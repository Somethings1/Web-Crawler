The round had no lead investor, but Cluster Capital contributed the largest share at 30%, Gasp founder and CEO Peter Kris told The Block.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gasp began its fundraising efforts last November and concluded them this month, Kris said, noting that the investment was structured as a SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/171609\/why-equity-plus-token-warrants-is-the-new-go-to-formula-for-crypto-vcs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">token warrants<\/a> round.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A source with direct knowledge of the matter told The Block that the round has brought Gasp's fully diluted token valuation to $80 million.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gasp, formerly known as Mangata Finance, is a cross-chain swap protocol that currently supports transfers between Ethereum scaling networks such as Arbitrum and Optimism. Its goal is to eventually support all blockchains.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gasp, initially incubated by Polychain, started in 2020 within the Polkadot ecosystem. However, it did not launch on the mainnet as the team was not confident in Polkadot, according to Kris.

He added that \"Gasp on EigenLayer will make cross-chain atomic swaps as easy as calling a smart contract on Ethereum or any other connected chain.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Following a successful testnet, Gasp plans to progress to the mainnet and token launches. Kris said that a new token called GASP will be introduced and airdropped to users, including those holding Mangata X (MGX) tokens. \"MGX is an economic testnet we ran from one year ago. MGX holders will get part of the airdrop of GASP,\" he said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Gasp team currently consists of 22 people, with plans to expand, especially in marketing, Kris said. The latest private funding round has brought Gasp's total funding to date to around $11 million.<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
