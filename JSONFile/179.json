The next two phases focused on the interoperability of blockchain-based networks for Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) and cross-border Payment-versus-Payment (PvP). These four phases proved the technical viability of the project. Hence, the final phase focused on proving value, including how to improve settlement efficiencies, and it went successful.","\"The multi-currency payments network prototype developed under Project Ubin Phase 5 successfully settled payments in different currencies on the same network,\" said the central bank. \"An international settlement network, modelled after this payments network prototype, could enable faster and cheaper transactions than conventional cross-border payments channels.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JPMorgan tech&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span>","The prototype has been developed in collaboration with Temasek, an investment firm owned by the government of Singapore, and JPMorgan.
