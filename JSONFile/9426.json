Coinbase, for instance, offers products across custody, brokerage, and spot. Gemini, another US exchange, offers settlement, custody, and retail brokerage services.&nbsp;","As for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/19863\/a-chicago-trading-tech-firm-is-partnering-with-bitmex-to-unleash-crypto-derivatives-professional-traders\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BitMEX<\/a>, the firm's plan could help breathe new life into its once&nbsp;dominant&nbsp;business. Since the last bull market, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/25008\/bitmex-co-founder-signs-the-giving-pledge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BitMEX's<\/a> market share has dwindled despite being the pioneer of the popular perpetual swap and high product leverage. Still, the firm's volumes have steadily grown over the past two quarters, as shown by The Block's data.&nbsp;","","Höptner said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/25664\/bitmex-ventures-provides-funding-to-philippine-cryptocurrency-exchange-pdax\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the firm<\/a> can continue to grow its business by serving as a center of information for regulators and clients alike through a new academy service. The project\u2014which doesn't have a set launch date\u2014will provide educational content on crypto trading and derivatives.&nbsp;","\"We need to bring more transparency to regulators,\" Höptner said. \"The way crypto exchanges work with their margin systems is different from the traditional world. The risk is not comparable. Ultimately it is up to us, and this is why we want to have an academy, to explain it.\"","Still, it is not clear which agency will be the firm's primary regulator.","\"At this point, I can not share more on that,\" Höptner said.&nbsp;","Höptner does expect the firm to expand its headcount over the next year and said he's not ruling out a wide-range of capital raising measures.&nbsp;","\"We are very interested in monitoring the IPO side, SPAC side, and tokenization,\" he said. \"You have to evaluate everything.\"","© 2023 The Block.
