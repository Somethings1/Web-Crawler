Working with an Optimism node that is written in Rust makes it more flexible for developers to work with and run deeper analytics on Ethereum.","Venture firms are uniquely positioned to contribute to these kind of software developments because it's a difficult endeavor from which to profit, and they're already rolling in it. Rivals VCs like Paradigm and Jump make similar types of software contributions that are billed as public good initiatives.&nbsp;","Some of the firm's existing portfolio companies are already set to use Magi.
