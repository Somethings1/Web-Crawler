The current hash price is ~ $0.21. Hash price is determined by the price of Bitcoin and network mining difficulty. As price and mining difficulty change over time, it can significantly change how much revenue each machine generates.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Daily cost can be calculated by dividing a machine's watts by 1,000 (kW), multiplying by the electricity rate ($\/kWh), and multiplying by 24 (hours in a day).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another thing to note is even under an extreme price drop to $15,000 or lower, the cost to mine would eventually start dropping! This would be due to inefficient old-generation miners dropping off the network resulting in network difficulty dropping.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Machine Value Over Time<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While it\u2019s important to determine whether your rigs are producing a positive cash flow, you also should consider the future appreciation or depreciation of the machines you purchase.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the above example, ~2,050 S19j<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> pros would be an 8-figure CapEx investment, so it\u2019s very important to determine how the value of these machines will change over time in order to get a complete idea of future potential returns.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The value of the machine will be roughly the same as the price you purchase it at, but over time that value will change depending on the price of Bitcoin, mining difficulty, and the longevity of the machines you purchase.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the very long run, the machine will trend to both $0 and 0 BTC. But in the short to medium term, the value of the machine could trend up in both USD and BTC terms.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The above example is the estimated historical value of an S19 as calculated by the Hashrate Index.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Astonishingly, the dollar value of an S19 has increased significantly since the beginning of 2020. Even the BTC denominated value of the rig just reached a high not seen since August 2020.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Not only will new generation machines be spitting off positive cash flow, but it\u2019s possible they could increase in value too if the price of Bitcoin is going up.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin Mining in Practice<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the historic and current ROI look nice, it is difficult to procure ASICs, build large mining facilities, and source cheap scalable electricity all on your own.
