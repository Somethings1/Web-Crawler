One analyst interpreted the on-chain transfer of bitcoin, valued at over $1.4 billion, from exchanges to cold wallets in the past 24 hours as an indication of diminishing confidence in centralized monetary systems.","\"Bitcoin is exiting exchanges as trust in the global markets and fiat money system collapses in the face of historic debt-to-GDP ratios crippling so-called advanced economies like the U.S.,\" Volcano Energy Chairman and advisor to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/maxkeiser\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Max Keiser<\/a> told The Block.","\"Storing wealth in unconfiscatable, perfect money bitcoin is now understood by the world's wealthy as their only chance to survive the new, greatest depression,\" he added.","The reduction of bitcoin liquid supply comes as the world's largest digital asset by market capitalization posted a 0.6% decline over the past 24 hours.
