Based on research and analysis, as well as an understanding of cybercriminals' history and cashout tactics, Binance arrived at the conclusion that the biggest security problem in the industry today is money connected to cyberattacks being laundered through nested services and parasite exchanger accounts that live inside macro VASPs, including exchanges like Binance.com. These criminals enjoy taking advantage of reputable exchanges\u2019 liquidity, diverse digital asset offerings and well-developed APIs.","In a majority of the cases associated with illicit blockchain flows coming onto exchanges, the exchange is not harbouring the actual criminal group themselves, but rather being used as a middleman to launder stolen profits. Figure 1 shows an example of the money laundering process on an exchange in relation to cyber attacks:","","","Blockchain analysis shows a network of money launderers living inside macro exchanges which deposit and withdraw to each other to wash the money. Understanding this diagnosis, Binance is taking the necessary steps to prevent illicit activity. They apply a two-pronged approach: 1) implementing detection mechanisms to identify and offboard suspicious accounts 2) collaborating with law enforcement to build cases and take down criminal groups.","They applied the two-pronged approach to the FANCYCAT investigation: AML detection and analytics program detected suspicious activity on Binance.com and expanded the suspect cluster. Once they mapped out the complete suspect network, they worked with private sector chain analytics companies TRM Labs and Crystal (BitFury) to analyze on-chain activity and gain a better understanding of this group and its attribution. Based on analysis, they found that this specific group was not only associated with laundering Cl0p attack funds, but also with Petya and other illegally sourced funds. This led to the identification and eventual arrest of FANCYCAT.","They are continuing to investigate the FANCYCAT criminal syndicate across multiple jurisdictions and the connections associated with other cyber attacks.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About Binance <\/strong>","Binance is the world\u2019s leading blockchain and cryptocurrency infrastructure provider with a financial product suite that includes the largest digital asset exchange by volume.
