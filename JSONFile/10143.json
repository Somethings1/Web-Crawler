As for suspects' modus operandi, in each case, they gain entry into victims' homes by posing as delivery persons or people of authority. Once inside the homes, they seize crucial information that grants access to the victims' crypto accounts, the police said.","They have asked crypto investors to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions to safeguard themselves and their assets.","Canada is one of the popular nations for growing crypto adoption.
