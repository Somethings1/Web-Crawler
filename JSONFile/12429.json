In the speech, Waller mentioned that the easing of the U.S. economy's pace was an encouraging sign, indicating that the current monetary policy aligns with the Fed's 2% inflation goal. \"Data for October indicated an easing in economic activity, and forecasts for the fourth quarter show the kind of moderation that is more in keeping with progress on lowering inflation,\" Waller said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/speech\/waller20231128a.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">speech<\/a> on Tuesday.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin momentum has been bolstered by the anticipation of an upcoming Fed rate pause.<\/span>","Waller added that he is confident current monetary policy is \"well positioned to slow the economy and get inflation back to 2%.\" His comments \u2014 combined with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cmegroup.com\/markets\/interest-rates\/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CME FedWatch's<\/a> 95% probability of a rate pause at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in December \u2014 are fostering optimism among analysts.","The Fed official was encouraged by the consumer price index inflation reading for October. \"This is what I want to see,\" he said. \"For the month, there was no inflation, prices were virtually flat, and unlike earlier moments where improvements were concentrated in some goods and services, the moderation in inflation was broadly distributed,\" he added.&nbsp;","However, Bitfinex analysts stressed that it is important to note that Waller also cautioned that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264048\/bitcoin-slips-lower-after-fed-minutes-reveal-lingering-inflation-fears\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">inflation<\/a> is still high. There is uncertainty about whether the slowing trend will be sustained. \"Therefore, while a rate pause might boost bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the short term, the long-term impact would depend on a range of economic factors and the overall direction of monetary policy,\" Bitfinex analysts said.","Investors are looking forward to the next <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252066\/bitcoins-price-is-flat-as-federal-reserve-keeps-interest-rates-unchanged\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Federal Reserve<\/a> rate announcement with anticipation. Particular attention will be given to the nuances in Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-announcement press conference and any signals about possible rate cuts in 2024.","Bitfinex analysts pointed to signals that indicate the market anticipates the U.S. central bank will commence cutting rates in the spring of 2024. \"The anticipation of such a pause has already influenced bond yields and trader expectations, with rate cuts being priced in starting from May 2024,\" Bitfinex analysts said.","\"We believe part of the current price action and long-term holder positioning for a sustained long-term price increase is part of this effect. This shift in monetary policy, if it occurs, could create a more favorable environment for investment in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies,\" the analysts added.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
