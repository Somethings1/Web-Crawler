When it comes to DeFi in particular, since the beginning of 2023, TVL has jumped from around $38 billion to its yearly high of $52 billion, a 36% hike in dollar terms.","The TVL metric, however, is not immune from the volatility of asset prices, which can heavily influence its value. The latest uptrend could be partly attributed to the increasing market values of major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, as well as steadily-rising <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/265887\/crypto-fund-inflow-bitcoin-ether-18-month-highs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">inflows<\/a> from investors.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/total-value-locked-tvl\/value-locked-by-blockchain\/embed\" title=\"Value Locked by Blockchain\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","In addition to market recovery, specific improvements and upgrades within certain DeFi protocols have also contributed to the recent TVL jump.&nbsp;","In 2023, there was a significant rise in real world assets (RWAs) niche within DeFi, especially at <a href=\"https:\/\/makerdao.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MakerDAO<\/a>, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235837\/makerdao-purchases-additional-700-million-in-treasury-bonds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">integrated<\/a> close to $2.5 billion in RWA collateral, primarily in U.S. treasury bills, to support its Dai stablecoin. In this manner, it also reduced its dependence on centralized stablecoins such as USDC. MakerDAO's value locked has surged to over $8 billion, along with an increase in annualized revenue.","Maker also introduced a lending protocol called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229805\/makerdao-boosts-dai-lending-capabilities-via-spark-protocol-roll-out\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Spark<\/a>, which saw significant inflows in the latter half of the year. The platform allows users to deposit their DAI stablecoins using the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) to exchange them for sDAI, enabling them to earn interest while retaining liquidity.","Similarly, liquid staking protocols like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/226879\/lido-deposits-surpass-12-billion-as-ethereums-shapella-boosts-liquid-staking\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lido Finance<\/a> gained traction, allowing users to earn rewards without locking up their ether with validators.
