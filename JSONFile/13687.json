Collins first made major headlines in the cryptocurrency world when he told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/former-energy-trader-goes-all-in-on-bitcoin-1508590802\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Wall Street Journal that he was going all-in on bitcoin<\/a>.&nbsp;","At the time, Collins said he was launching a crypto fund, dubbed Morpheus Asset Strategies. \"Virtual currency for me is a deep passion,\" he said in October 2017. \"We're just now beginning to turn it into a business.\" The fund is operating but has not taken any outside funds.&nbsp;","Collins' new crypto business, MGH, is set to launch as soon as March, according to a direct source.&nbsp;","\"What we want to prepare for and help facilitate is when a really large broker dealer wants to give access to their millions of clients but they want to do it in a safe and sound, secure way, run by professionals,\" Collins said of the business to Bloomberg News in 2018.","According to its website, the firm is building out a trading and banking platform for digital assets.

It will launch before the exchange, the source added.&nbsp;","\"It\u2019s definitely innovative to be seeking CFTC clearance, a nice \u201Ccross\u201D custodial offering, in addition to being a futures exchange (that apparently will execute trades on cboe for you?),\" said one hedge funder based in Puerto Rico of SJMX's business.&nbsp;","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wall Street leadership<\/strong>","As for its staff, it includes Noble's former COO and interim CFO, Nick Varelakis, who is now CFO of Mercantile Global Holdings.
