It added more than $2.2 billion in new originations, a 324% increase relative to the same quarter last year.&nbsp;","Since the launch of the business, Genesis has originated more than $8.4 billion in crypto loans.&nbsp;","","","In a statement to The Block, CEO Michael Moro said he was comfortable with the growth of the business, noting:","\"The growth of our business is a function of many things, not the least of which is our risk framework. As long as the business is growing within our existing risk framework, I'm very comfortable with it.\"","Still, much of the quarter-over-quarter growth was the result of March's drawdown at the tail-end of Q1, according to Moro.&nbsp;","\"Unless crypto prices go up significantly, I do not expect anything near 120% QoQ growth going forward,\" he said.&nbsp;","On the spot trading front, Genesis traded $5.2 billion worth of crypto in Q2. Meanwhile, its newly-launched derivatives desk saw $400 million worth of volume in &nbsp;June.&nbsp;","Traders seeking new yield opportunities underpinned this growth, Genesis said in the report.","\"A major theme in Q2 was the demand for yield on crypto assets,\" the report said. \"Yield drives markets in crypto and in other asset classes, but the last three months seemed specifically yield-centric.\"","The second-quarter was largely characterized by low volatility \u2014 which forced traders <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/72051\/as-bitcoins-volatility-hits-new-lows-traders-are-turning-to-defi-and-options\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">to look towards new opportunities for profit<\/a>, as The Block previously reported. For Genesis, that translated into traders engaging with its business to execute on three main yield strategies.&nbsp;","\"The three forms of yield generation most prevalent are spot lending, call overwriting, and most recently, liquidity mining,\" according to the report.&nbsp;","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/73893\/genesis-lending-surge-trading-yield\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-73896 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Screen-Shot-2020-08-04-at-8.37.56-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1364\" height=\"528\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/a>","To further capitalize on opportunities in liquidity mining, or yield farming, hedge funds would borrow additional tokens to then deposit on platforms like Compound to earn yield. Traders moved quickly between various tokens, according to Genesis head of derivatives Joshua Lim.&nbsp;","\"The demand to borrow assets which have the most advantageous fee structures increases when the market is hot and rapidly decreases once the market is onto the next asset,\" the firm said. \"At the start, we saw interest in BAT and REP skyrocket after those Compound markets were paying hefty fees. Over time, we have seen the demand normalize primarily to stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI as they are easier to source and still highly profitable to farm.\"","These shifts can take one to two weeks, according to Lim.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
