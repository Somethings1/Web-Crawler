Greed and exuberance took hold only to unravel in spectacular fashion.","The year started with attention on the timing of The Merge, which by now has become almost a footnote, overshadowed by scandal and collapse. Luna kicked off a wave of contagion among previously well-respected crypto firms. Few escaped getting hit by at least one lending company or exchange going under, culminating with the stunning implosion of FTX, once the third largest exchange by volume.","During the year, a common phrase among crypto circles was: \u201CHow much worse can it really get?\u201D Somehow that question was answered each and every time with a new low, typically involving bankruptcy proceedings.","It wasn't all pain. Ukraine successfully raised nearly $100 million using cryptocurrency donations, showing how the technology can be effective. Bored Ape Yacht Club owners saw an airdrop worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each \u2014 as long as they didn\u2019t lose their tokens in the many exploits targeting Bored Ape owners. Finally, the Ethereum blockchain had its biggest moment yet as it successfully implement The Merge.","Here\u2019s a look at the 10 biggest stories from the last year in crypto.","What started with an article by CoinDesk shedding light into Alameda Research\u2019s balance sheet soon turned into a Twitter spat with former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried blaming a competitor \u2014 read Binance \u2014 of spreading false rumors. At the time, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was dumping FTX\u2019s native token FTT and showing concern about the health of the exchange. In response, Bankman-Fried tried to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/183680\/ftx-fine-bankman-fried-binance-work-together\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reassure<\/a> customers that FTX was \u201Cfine.\u201D","Customers weren\u2019t convinced. Over the first weekend of November, the exchange\u2019s users withdrew around $6 billion of funds, pulling them to other exchanges or their own wallets for safekeeping. During the run, there was still a lot of speculation and uncertainty about the state of the exchange, with many people withdrawing just to be safe. But it was only when withdrawals <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/184176\/ftx-appears-to-have-stopped-processing-withdrawals-on-chain-data-show\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">were halted<\/a> that the situation seemed truly dire.","On Nov. 8, FTX admitted it was game over and said it was looking to get acquired by Binance \u2014 leading to a devastating crash in the price of FTT.","A few days later it filed for bankruptcy.","In the aftermath, we found out that the exchange was an absolute disaster of historic proportions. It appears that funds were comingled between the exchange and Alameda, risk controls were lacking and client funds were effectively used to pay off a massive margin position that gotten out of hand.","New FTX CEO John J. Ray III <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/187982\/ftx-bankruptcy-filings-highlight-complete-failure-of-corporate-controls\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">summed<\/a> it up nicely: \u201CNever in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.\u201D","Since then, Bankman-Fried has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186393\/sam-bankman-fried-arrested-in-the-bahamas\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">arrested<\/a> and transferred to the U.S., where he is facing up to 115 years in prison. FTX\u2019s creditors are now looking ahead to the next decade of proceedings, while those who lost funds to a similar exchange collapse of Mt. Gox in 2014 are still waiting.","While FTX was arguably the most destructive event \u2014 in terms of real, not paper, losses \u2014 Luna\u2019s collapse was the event that triggered all of the fallout.","Luna was a novel idea of creating an algorithmic stablecoin, a token designed to stay pegged to the U.S. dollar without being directly collateralized. It involved a freefloating token called luna and a stablecoin called UST. The problem was it had one design flaw: A fundamental construction that meant, in the event of an effective bank run on the token, the tokens would create a death spiral, sending their values plummeting.","And that is exactly what happened. Due to the core mechanism in place, as UST lost its peg to the U.S. dollar and the situation worsened, the network minted more and more luna to try to save the value of UST. This caused the value of luna to drop, resulting in even more minting on an exponential scale. During luna\u2019s collapse, its supply went from 340 million tokens <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/146762\/luna-supply-soared-to-6-5-trillion-coins-before-terras-latest-halt\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">to 6.5 trillion<\/a>. Its price went the other way, completely flatlining.","The total damage was the loss of luna\u2019s $22 billion market cap, wiping out huge paper gains for many retail and institutional investors. While luna was restarted under a new name, it didn\u2019t fix the disaster and the wider crypto industry is still picking up the pieces.","Until the collapse of luna, Three Arrows Capital were widely regarded as one of the best hedge funds in the crypto space. Its reputation was of such caliber that companies like Genesis, Blockchain.com and Voyager Digital lent the firm billions of dollars.","Yet the fund got hit over and over again until it was wiped out. 3AC co-founder Kyle Davies said that the fund only took a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/193649\/three-arrows-capital-co-founder-says-it-wasnt-luna-that-took-it-out-but-ftx\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$600 million hit<\/a> from luna \u2014 from a $200 million initial investment \u2014 which was damaging but not a death blow. Then it faced a liquidity crunch, lenders recalling loans, the decline in prices for many major cryptocurrencies and even drops in the price of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and stETH \u2014 a liquid staking derivative of ether. All of these added further pain for the fund.","Davies claimed the final blow was when its remaining position on FTX was liquidated. He made further claims that Alameda Research was aware of its liquidation level. Since then the firm has filed for liquidation, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/158169\/three-arrows-capital-3ac-creditors-list-3-5-billion-crypto-affidavits\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$3.5 billion of claims<\/a> from creditors.","Taking a break from bankruptcy filings for a moment, earlier this year we saw a country take advantage of the global reach that cryptocurrency offers to raise funding. Ukraine, in the early days of the Russian invasion, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/135569\/ukraines-official-twitter-account-posts-pleas-for-crypto-donations-amid-russian-invasion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">asked for donations<\/a> in bitcoin, ether and the stablecoin tether. In total, the country received <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/03\/09\/ukraine-has-received-close-to-100-million-in-crypto-donations\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">nearly $100 million<\/a> in crypto donations from individuals around the world.","The donations were spurred on by an interesting ploy. During the donation period, Ukraine said that it intended to airdrop tokens to those who donated. This led to a rapid increase in donations by those speculating on the potential value of the airdropped tokens, as opposed to humanitarian reasons. Yet it abruptly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/136211\/ukraine-cancels-crypto-airdrop-plans-to-sell-nfts-instead\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cancelled<\/a> the planned airdrop, announcing plans to sell NFTs instead.","The NFT sale was a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/140608\/ukraines-nft-collection-is-still-far-from-selling-out-after-a-week\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">flop<\/a>. They only ended up bringing in around $1.2 million, a small fraction of their wider crypto donations.","In March, Bored Ape Yacht Club owners were treated to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/138156\/apecoin-tied-to-bored-ape-nft-ecosystem-debuts-with-planned-community-airdrop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">airdrop<\/a> of ApeCoins for each of their NFTs \u2014 whether they were bored apes, mutant apes or had additional NFTs that were part of the kennel club collection. The airdrop for one Bored Ape was initially worth around $140,000.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSome traders were crafty about the airdrop. One person&nbsp;<a class=\"c-link\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/138410\/someone-borrowed-5-bored-apes-to-claim-1-1-million-of-ape-tokens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/138410\/someone-borrowed-5-bored-apes-to-claim-1-1-million-of-ape-tokens\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">borrowed a set<\/a>&nbsp;of five Bored Apes from a vault designed for fractionizing NFTs, whereby a holder creates derivative fungible tokens that each purport to represent a corresponding amount of the NFT. For example, if a holder owns 2% of the tokens, he theoretically owns 2% of the NFT.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nIn one swift transaction, they took the apes out of the pool, claimed the airdrop and returned them \u2014 netting a cheeky $1.1 million in ApeCoin. Not bad for a day\u2019s work.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A Bored Ape from the BAYC collection. Image: Yuga Labs.<\/span>","Around this time, there were rumors of something bigger. The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/137829\/bored-ape-yacht-club-yuga-labs-virtual-land-sales-metaverse\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">broke the news<\/a> that Yuga Labs was planning to sell metaverse land for an upcoming game. Sure enough, in May, Yuga Labs sold 55,000 plots of land for $317 million, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/144549\/otherside-land-nfts-sell-out-in-hours-as-yuga-labs-rakes-in-317-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">setting a new record<\/a> for an NFT mint. At the time, Yuga Labs even hinted it may start its own blockchain, but nothing has come of that so far.","While Axie Infinity was crypto\u2019s biggest blockchain game, its underlying blockchain the Ronin network ended up being the ground for crypto\u2019s biggest hack. The network <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/139761\/axie-infinitys-ethereum-sidechain-ronin-hit-by-600-million-exploit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lost $540 million<\/a> of cryptocurrency after a hacker took control of five of its nine validators.","A few months later, The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/156038\/how-a-fake-job-offer-took-down-the-worlds-most-popular-crypto-game\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">found out<\/a> that the hack was caused by a senior engineer at Sky Mavis \u2014 the company behind Axie Infinity \u2014 being duped into applying for a fake job. After multiple interviews, the engineer was sent an offer in the form of a PDF document, which contained spyware. This gave them control over four of the validators but they need one more to take full control. They managed to get the fifth from an Axie DAO validator.","Following the hack, Sky Mavis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/164182\/sky-mavis-ronin-sidechain-expands-to-17-validators-to-boost-security\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">increased<\/a> the number of validators on the network to 17 validators. The hacker was later identified as the North Korean hacking group Lazarus.","Back to bankruptcy. In the wake of luna\u2019s crash, lending company Celsius Network turned out to have a large hole in its finances. It's still unclear as to exactly how this happened but the company appeared to have a myriad of high-risk lending strategies mixed with a willingness to throw customer funds into experimental DeFi platforms, such as Badger Finance.","In July, Celsius <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/157491\/crypto-lender-celsius-declares-chapter-11-bankruptcy-in-new-york\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Court filings showed that it had a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/157647\/celsius-bankruptcy-documents-claim-1-2-billion-balance-sheet-gap\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$1.2 billion hole<\/a> in its balance sheet. This even included $600 million of its own celsius tokens as assets, even though that was far greater than the token's market cap at the time, suggesting those tokens would not be able to be sold for anything close to that amount.","Digital Currency Group (DCG) is a behemoth in the industry, owning Grayscale, Genesis and The Block's' rival CoinDesk while having investments across the crypto space. Yet it was not immune from the collapse of luna and the wider market downturn.","Genesis is the main cause of its concerns. The company lent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/158167\/crypto-lender-genesis-lent-2-36-billion-to-three-arrows-capital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$2.3 billion<\/a> to Three Arrows Capital, leaving it with a shortfall of over $1 billion. DCG took on this liability to help protect the company. But Genesis took a further hit when FTX collapsed as it had $175 million left on the exchange. Now the company is in dire straits and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/188891\/genesis-warns-of-possible-bankruptcy-without-funding-bloomberg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on the brink<\/a> of bankruptcy.","Grayscale is DCG\u2019s main money maker, bringing in huge revenue from its annual 2% fee, with its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/structured-products\/bitcoin-holdings-of-grayscale-bitcoin-trust\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">looking after<\/a> $10.6 billion of assets. But GBTC has seen its value drop far below the value of the underlying bitcoin, making it painful for investors to cash out. DCG tried to help by buying <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/121482\/dcg-has-purchased-388-million-of-gbtc-shares-and-is-upping-its-limit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$388 million<\/a> of shares with plans to go as high as $1 billion.
