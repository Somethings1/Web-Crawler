In a separate letter organized by the ABA, 49 state banking associations, as well as bankers from the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, also raised similar concerns.","\u201CTo ensure effective consumer protection and financial stability, it is critical that the stablecoin ecosystem, like the banking ecosystem, is subject to strong regulatory oversight,\u201D the ABA and state bankers associations <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aba.com\/-\/media\/documents\/letters-to-congress-and-regulators\/072123-joint-aba-state-association-stablecoin-letter.pdf?rev=0d4c86ba7a8c47c8b7fe7ad8e171a4c8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a>. The associations added that they want \u201Cthe same level of Federal oversight to state-licensed stablecoin issuers as is currently applied to state-chartered banks.\u201D","Likewise, the ABA, CBA, and CUNA raised concerns over increased \u201Carbitrage\u201D and \u201Csystemic risk\u201D about the state regulatory approval approach within the bill, and called for stablecoin issuers to be subject to the same federal oversight that banks and credit unions receive.","\u201CGiven these entities' intent to create new money, we believe they should be subject to at least the same form of supervision from a federal regulator as are state-chartered banks and credit unions,\u201D the trio of national associations <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aba.com\/-\/media\/documents\/letters-to-congress-and-regulators\/07192023-joint-trade-stablecoin-letter.pdf?rev=f7b2a0cf71ca4e9798281983c0570b7c\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a>. \u201CThe draft legislation, however, imposes critical limits on the role of a federal regulator to approve and supervise state-licensed payment stablecoin issuers and creates a regulatory arbitrage opportunity for nonbank entities to shop for the \u2018best\u2019 regulatory regime by state. Further, it is unlikely that states are prepared to regulate stablecoins on their own, especially given stablecoin issuers\u2019 capacity to quickly scale into global stablecoins that facilitate international payments.\u201D","The national trade associations asserted that stablecoins have \u201Cclear monetary policy implications\u201D and call for \u201Cfederal oversight that ensures financial stability and consumer protection.\u201D","The groups also called on the stablecoin bill to include language mandating examinations by regulators and third-party audits of reserves that go beyond current asset reporting requirements within the bill, to ensure that stablecoin issuers have the assets they claim they do to fully back the fiat-denominated tokens they issue.","The national associations letter also called for an explicit ban, or at least limitations, on the ability of a commercial company to own or control a payment stablecoin issuer, similar to existing separations between commercial and banking companies in the U.S.","\u201CThese restrictions are critical to protect consumers from potential self-dealing or conflicts of interest,\u201D the groups wrote.","Industry opposition could sway Democrats, and possibly Republicans, from supporting the House Republican-drafted bill, which is the product of bipartisan negotiations stretching back to last summer.","Several Democrats on the Financial Services Committee, including the panel\u2019s most senior Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., have raised concerns over allowing too much leeway around the state approval of stablecoins. But the stablecoins bill is currently seen as having a greater chance of bipartisan support, and as a result passage into law, than a separate bill co-drafted by the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees that would create new, crypto-specific market regulation.","Early Tuesday morning, House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., pushed back scheduled committee debate over the stablecoins bill to Thursday, while the committee will still consider the market structure legislation on Wednesday."],"hashtag":["BUSD","CONGRESS","FDIC","FEDERAL RESERVE","HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE","OCC","TETHER","USDC","USDP"]}
