But we've seen numerous innovations around the second-order derivatives of Swivel and Tempest on the fixed and floating rate interest side of things,\" Dwyer explained.","Dwyer is excited about the collateral and interest rate segment of the market, which he sees as innovating at a fast pace. \"I think that a lot of these different sorts of fixed income derivatives protocols that are out there are going to evolve in really exciting ways over the next the next couple of months.\"","He believes that DeFi will eventually match more centralized activities as the market will see increased innovation.","\"What DeFi offers is in some instances, just sort of a new set of venues that look a lot like the centralized exchange venues that we're accustomed to trading on.<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"&nbsp;<\/i>He cited GSR's recent investments into Dydx and HashFlow, the latter of which Dwyer said recently reported a billion dollars worth of trading volume.","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Eyeing a multi-chain future<\/b>","Looking to the future, Dwyer said he believes that it will be one marked by a variety of networks that serve different purposes \u2014 and in the background, in some cases.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We believe that in the future you're not going to know what chain you're interacting with necessarily or care,\" he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">These different chains will have varying kinds of specialization, such as high speed, high settlement, and the ability to create a central limit order book, according to Dwyer.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As he put it: \u201CIt's almost like if you wanted to use Uber and Lyft, you had to have two different phones, and that doesn't seem like a sustainable way of the future.\"<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
