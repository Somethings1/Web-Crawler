We expect a more muted approach to investment this year, certainly in the first half. Zoom out and consider that the major banks have invested $20 billion in blockchain technology and blockchain companies over the last three years, whilst it\u2019s hard to assign a new figure, it is not going to zero.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For investment and broader adoption to continue, 2023 must be a year which sees the industry reset, push for regulation, and maintain relevance with the institutional community through product innovation and self-regulatory, quality corporate governance and risk management.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Actions speak louder<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As we have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189611\/crypto-regulate-to-consolidate\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">argued<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> before, what the industry needs most now is to come together and put solid foundations in place to rebuild confidence. Regulation protects consumers, creates stability, and ultimately harvests innovation. Regulators around the world are focusing their attention on crypto like never before \u2013 be it rightly cracking down on violations around insider trading and fraud, or imposing standards to protect consumers and reduce market fragmentation.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This progress is encouraging.

In the meantime, it is the responsibility of all blockchain and crypto companies to act now, adopt best practices and behave as if they are already regulated. As a longstanding operator of FX exchanges, we have applied robust risk and governance controls to our crypto currency business from the outset. We straddle both camps and recognise where TradFi can provide guidance and act as a conductor of change. In establishing new regulation, it\u2019s time to take a considered approach. This is not at odds with being innovative.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The decade of market digitisation&nbsp;<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto and digital assets more broadly, have the potential to change the velocity of money and despite the setbacks faced, we are without doubt in the decade of market digitisation.
