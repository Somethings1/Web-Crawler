A standard web3 wallet is enough\u201D said Villalba. Those who wish to operate a node on Diva and earn rewards may do so with as little as 1 ETH, and the protocol works with any system that meets the minimum requirements to run a full Ethereum node.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In return for staking ETH on Diva, participants receive a one-to-one ratio of divETH, a freely tradable liquid asset. Any divETH rewards received by stakers accrue in wallets on a daily basis. DivETH can be unstaked and redeemed for ETH, again at a one-to-one ratio, at any time following the March 2023 Capella update, according to Diva.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The protocol is built to offer rewards to both passive stakers as well as full-time node operators, where \u201Crewards will be socialized across the entire network to achieve smooth and predictable reward rates,\u201D said Villalba.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nodes on Diva collaborate together by posting a bond of 1 ETH to form groups.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Each group of 16 nodes is matched up against 16 ETH from various stakers on the network, together forming a full validation node.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Eduard Antuña, founder of the open source Ethereum validator protocol Dappnode, first <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iHmnBh4En2A&amp;t=432s\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposed<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> the idea of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) \u2014 which was to become the basis for Diva \u2014 at the ETHDenver conference, last year.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CHe saw how the cost was prohibitive to many, and thought to make a \u2018decentralized staking pool\u2019 where nodes would validate for each other cooperatively, instead of in their own silos,\u201D said Villalba.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The high threshold of 32 ETH to set up a validator node on Ethereum is a cost point that excludes many network participants operating nodes of their own. Given that, staking protocols remain largely presided over by organizations such as Lido, where validator keys are in the control of a minority group of whitelisted node operators, and centralized exchanges such as Binance, Kraken and Coinbase that fully control funds and validator keys.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The growth of such platforms erodes the values of decentralization that are core to the Ethereum blockchain, said Diva.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe truly believe that we won't see real decentralization until we solve the validator problem. Diva is our proposal to the community effort to solve that,\u201D said Villalba.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Concerned by issues of censorship and the power of single parties over the custody of validator keys, and noting the rise of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/180158\/63-of-ethereum-transaction-blocks-are-now-ofac-compliant\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OFAC compliance-<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">driven censorship on Ethereum, Diva\u2019s team worked with Antuña to build a prototype at ETHLisbon\u2019s hackathon, said Villalba.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When presented with the opportunity to integrate the protocol, major staking provider Lido declined.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CInitially we offered Lido a deep partnership, offering our tech to power the heart of a Lido v2 built purely on DVT,\u201D said Villalba.
