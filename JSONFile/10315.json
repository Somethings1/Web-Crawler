It employs a type of zk-proof called zkSNARKs to bundle many transactions into a single \u201Crollup\u201D proof that is published to the main chain, thus increasing transaction throughput. The network is \"fully scalable\" up to 300 transactions per second, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/aztec-protocol\/aztec-zkrollup-layer-2-privacy-1978e90ee3b6\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to Aztec<\/a>.","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/68584\/matter-labs-deploys-scaling-solution-zkrollup-on-ethereum-mainnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Other groups<\/a><\/span> are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/75209\/dex-dydx-starkware-layer-2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">developing zk-rollup<\/span><\/a> technologies aimed at improving <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/6719\/parity-progresses-with-5-million-grant-from-ethereum-foundation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum\u2019s<\/a> scalability. What makes Aztec\u2019s technology unique, according to CEO Tom Walton-Pocock, is that it also adds \u201Cprogrammable privacy.\u201D","At the heart of Aztec 2.0 is a zkSNARK standard that Aztec\u2019s research team recently developed, called PLONK. The company used PLONK \u2014 which Walton-Pocock says has quickly become a widely-used standard within the community developing zkSNARKs \u2014 to build a two-layer system for processing transactions.","First, each transaction is made private \u2014 the sender, recipient, and amounts are all hidden \u2014 using a zkSNARK. Then, those transactions are bundled into a rollup \u2014 using additional zkSNARKs. The end result is \u201CSNARKs inside SNARKs,\u201D said Walton-Pocock, who <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/aztec-protocol\/aztec-fast-privacy-with-zk%C2%B2-rollup-7c742f45457\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has called<\/a> this arrangement a \u201Czk-zk rollup.\u201D","Aztec's team says PLONK allows for the development of a <a href=\"https:\/\/eprint.iacr.org\/2019\/953.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201Cuniversal\u201D zkSNARK<\/span><\/a>. That means Aztec\u2019s SNARKs can also be programmed to work with \u201Creally any Defi interaction where the resulting action is a token,\u201D said Walton-Pocock.","Older zkSNARK systems, like the one originally used to enable private transactions in Zcash, are programmed to do one thing many times. Adding new use cases would require a new so-called trusted setup, the elaborate multi-party computation process required to establish the public security parameters of any zkSNARK system. The use cases of SNARKs developed using PLONK are theoretically unlimited after the first trusted setup.","Aztec&nbsp;has developed a new scripting language, called Noir, that developers can use to write zkSNARK transactions that are compatible with Aztec 2.0.&nbsp;","In September, the Electric Coin Company <a href=\"https:\/\/electriccoin.co\/blog\/ecc-releases-code-for-halo-2\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">revealed<\/span><\/a> that PLONK would be used as a component of a future version of Zcash called Halo 2","Aztech is launching a testnet this week that will enable private sends of Dai and other ERC20 tokens. The team plans to launch a mainnet in November.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
