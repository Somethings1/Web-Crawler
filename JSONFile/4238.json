Importantly, The SEC requires companies to engage with transfer agents for Reg A+ offering, a less burdensome route to raise public funds that hold appeal to many blockchain companies, according to Stein. With the license and its blockchain native platform, Harbor is hoping to target a growing group of blockchain companies looking to conduct Reg A+, said Stein.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, both Blockstack and YouNow, the only two blockchain companies that have won SEC approval to conduct a Reg A+, don't think it's necessary to have a transfer agent. The two companies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1719379\/000110465919020748\/a18-15736_1partiiandiii.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">state<\/a> in their offering circulars that their tokens are not \u201Cnot currently securities\u201D and some activities that a regular transfer agent would perform is done automatically on the blockchain. As such, since the license is meant to regulate persons that act as transfer agents for securities, Blockstack and YouNow are exempt from the requirement, according to the circulars.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For Harbor, however, being a transfer agent also complements the broker-dealer license it received in September. According to Stein, the two licenses enable it to facilitate the full life cycle of security token issuance as well as regulated trading, thus <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">strengthening its appeal to companies seeking to do security token offerings.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThink of the entire life cycle of this, there is\u2026 selling the investors into the investment, maintaining the investment while they are in, and controlling how they are traded. The broker-dealer is mostly involved in gaining the investors into the investment. The transfer agent maintains the records while they are in and pays out dividends, and the transfer agent controls when they pay out,\u201D said Stein.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
