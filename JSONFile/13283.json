Since then, the Maven team has made 28 investments \u2014 primarily in DeFi protocols and Web3 apps.","Maven has been venture investing since 2017, and through its two funds has backed projects such as Celestia, Qredo, Nym Technologies, Spectral Finance, Merit Circle, Maple Finance, Anoma and Zapper.","Balder Bomans, a partner at Maven 11 Capital, said the company invests in both tokens and equity. But he added that he \u201Cvery strongly believes that tokens are going to be the go-to in terms of crypto and the development of this asset class.\u201D","Like a growing number of crypto-native investment firms, Maven also plays an active role helping the protocols it has backed to grow. It is, for example, acting as a \u2018pool delegate\u2019 for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/124694\/defi-goes-institutional-maple-finance-offers-syndicated-loans-to-alameda-research\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Maple Finance<\/a> \u2014 which entails managing a collection of lenders and borrowers whose contracts are buttressed by blockchain technology.","\u201CAs a venture capitalist we think our model will massively change within the coming years. It\u2019s already changing in terms of what our roles are within these ecosystems,\u201D said Bomans. &nbsp;","The capital for Maven\u2019s first fund came primarily from wealthy individuals, whereas its second vehicle also manages money contributed by crypto entrepreneurs, family offices and institutions such as fund-of-funds. &nbsp;","As for where that capital will be directed, Bomans said Maven is bullish on the ability of DeFi to make financial markets more efficient, and highlighted options and insurance as two underdeveloped areas that the firm is keen on.","It is also looking closely at non-fungible token (NFT) infrastructure players, and has already invested in NFTfi, a marketplace for NFT-backed loans.","Â© 2023 The Block.
