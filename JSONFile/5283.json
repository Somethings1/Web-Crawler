The proposal is currently in the \"temperature-check\" phase.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To reduce risk, the proposal suggests limiting the onboarding of assets and setting conservative risk parameters. It recommends onboarding only three collateral types: wrapped ETH (WETH) and wrapped MATIC (WMATIC) tokens, as well as USDC stablecoin. It also recommends including only one borrowable asset, the USDC stablecoin.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The proposal says it also aims to lay the groundwork for possibly issuing Aave's GHO stablecoin on the zkEVM, if the governance were to consider this option in the future.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygon's<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/197324\/polygons-zkevm-launched-its-second-testnet-the-last-step-before-mainnet-goes-live\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">zkEVM<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> will be a zero-knowledge or ZK-rollup that performs off-chain computations on a secondary layer for faster and cheaper transactions while prioritizing security.
