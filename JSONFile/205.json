In the next few weeks, Binance.US expects to share information pertaining to the costs of these efforts.&nbsp;","The proposed agreement comes in response to the SEC\u2019s motion to freeze all of Binance.US\u2019s assets following its lawsuit against the exchange, which alleges the exchanges were improperly connected and violated securities laws. The SEC expressed concerns that Binance.US funds could be moved offshore and requested a temporary restraining order. For its part, Binance.US\u2019s lawyers argued that freezing its assets would be too harsh, comparing it to a \u201Cdeath penalty.\u201D","U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson recommended the two parties reach an agreement rather than imposing a temporary restraining order given the complexity of the case and the two-week limit for further hearings.","The proposed agreement will require Binance.US to create new wallets that are inaccessible to Binance\u2019s global employees, provide additional information to the SEC, and agree to an expedited discovery schedule. During this time, U.S. customers will still be allowed to withdraw funds."],"hashtag":[]}
