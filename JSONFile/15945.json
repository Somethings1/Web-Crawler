When asked which U.S. political party they trust to tackle the issues around crypto, almost half of the voters polled \u2013 49% \u2013 picked \"neither.\"","\"Large numbers of voters are looking for policymakers who can boldly light a path forward on crypto policy,\" Paradigm's Justin Slaughter and Dominique Little wrote in a blog entry describing the poll's results.","In another point of industry reflection, more than one in 10 of those polled said they've either already bought a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) (6%) or are going to (6%).

Other polling on the general election have the two running neck-and-neck, with Trump often enjoying a slight edge.","Read More: U.S. President Again Proposes Crypto Mining Tax, 'Wash Sale Rule' for Digital Assets in New Budget"],"entity":[{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Public Opinion Strategies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Trump","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Dominique Little","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"39%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Donald Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"19%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"49%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"48%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"\" Paradigm","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Joe Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Justin Slaughter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New Budget","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Presidential election","Election 2024","Donald Trump","Joe Biden","Polls","Paradigm"],"authors":["Jesse Hamilton"]}
