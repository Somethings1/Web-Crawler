Maguire is just setting off his own and Tidwell is still an over-cautious, me-first player who has yet to have his epiphany.","Whether bitcoin winds up with Renee Zellweger in our story, of course, remains to be seen but it might be wise to consider the possibility that crypto really does find true love, financial success, and holds onto its moral compass along the way.","In fairness to&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Economist<\/em>, their polemic against bitcoin is in two parts. First, they trash bitcoin and cryptocurrencies because they\u2019re still not especially good as \u201Cmoney.\u201D","Don\u2019t tell this to folks in Venezuela, of course.&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"56f89f949263\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Indeed, just yesterday AirTM raised $7M to help build&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/29\/airtm-raises-7-million-to-fight-hyperinflation\/?ref=tokendaily\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/29\/airtm-raises-7-million-to-fight-hyperinflation\/?ref=tokendaily\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">its system for converting any type of money into any other<\/a>. The system doesn\u2019t require crypto, but one of the conversion options is to move into digital tokens like bitcoin.

The motivation is that institutions and individuals might want to move significant assets into bitcoin but can\u2019t today because of the lack of formal custodial solutions that meet the requirements of pension funds and 401Ks. Given the time horizons of these investments \u2014 and the clear interest in investing in crytpo \u2014 it\u2019s odd to argue that bitcoin is neither store of value nor unit of account.<\/span>","Indeed, even as bitcoin sits two thirds below its all-time highs, the total \u201Cmarket cap\u201D of the currency is $118&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">billion<\/em>.

And that\u2019s not an academic point either. Some people consider their home a store of value, but in most mid-size American cities home values rarely exceed overall inflation. Others consider fine art to serve that function. And while the value of a Monet tends to trend only upwards, the ability to convert it into something useful remains rather limited.
