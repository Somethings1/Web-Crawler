Gupta declined to comment on when CoinDCX began raising for the Series A.","\u201CThe recent developments in the cryptocurrency regulatory landscape in India are very encouraging and are likely to accelerate adoption and innovation in this sector. We are excited to be investors in CoinDCX and believe that their talented team and technology will allow them to be the dominant cryptocurrency venue in the region,\u201D said Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX and HDR Group.","Polychain Capital\u2019s founder Olaf Carlson-Wee echoed, saying that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is \u201Can encouraging sign for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem in India, and we are confident that there is huge potential growth in this market.\u201D","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u2018Exponential\u2019 growth<\/strong><\/span>","Founded in 2018, Mumbai-based CoinDCX claims to have seen \u201Cexponential\u201D growth in users since the lifting of the banking ban. \u201CDuring the ban, CoinDCX had registered more than 35,000 users. Since the ban was lifted, sign-ups on the platform increased by 10x,\u201D Gupta told The Block, adding that the exchange\u2019s top five markets are Surat, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, and Delhi.","Gupta declined to disclose growth in trading volumes but said the average daily trading volume has been around $10-15 million after the ban. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nIn comparison, rival WazirX, which is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/47852\/binance-acquires-indian-crypto-exchange-wazirx-to-serve-over-1-billion-people-of-the-country\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">owned<\/a> by Binance, has seen average volumes of $2-3 million, founder and CEO Nischal Shetty told The Block.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$5 trillion economy?<\/strong><\/span>","Looking ahead, CoinDCX aims to grow users further and bring the total number of crypto users in India from the current 5 million to 50 million via its \u201CTryCrypto\u201D initiative. Earlier this month, CoinDCX <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/58921\/binance-wazirx-launch-50m-token-fund-to-invest-in-indian-blockchain-startups\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> the initiative to commit $1.3 million toward creating awareness and adoption of crypto within India.","As a result of this effort, CoinDCX also plans to contribute to India\u2019s growth into a $5 trillion economy by 2025. \u201CTo achieve that target, India\u2019s minimum annual growth rate will need to be greater than 10.8% every year. With India\u2019s current GDP growth falling sharply from 8% last year to 5% in the second quarter of 2019, it is clear that our economy needs a strong boost to hit our target of being a $5 trillion economy. I believe India stands a chance to live up to this goal by embracing the next wave of crypto adoption,\u201D Gupta told The Block.","\u201COur Series A round is a testament to how crypto can increase foreign investment in the Indian economy and highlights the potential that global players see in the Indian crypto space,\u201D he added.","CoinDCX is also open to raising more funds in the near future. \u201CWe look at investments as a strategic tool to help us build better products for the future. Hence if we do receive interest in strategic partnerships, we will be happy to explore these opportunities,\u201D Gupta told The Block.","It remains unclear how much in total CoinDCX has raised to date. Gupta declined to comment on it, as well as the exchange\u2019s valuation.
