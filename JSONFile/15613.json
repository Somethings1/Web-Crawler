The trend was sparked by the rapid gain of several meme coins, like book of meme (BOME).","Conducting a pre-sale is simple: A token issuer posts a smart contract address and tells investors to deposit crypto tokens on the promise that, when the pre-sale ends, the newly issued tokens will be distributed to users based on the relative sizes of their deposits.","But the ease at which someone can start a token pre-sale, coupled with investors' fear of missing out, has led to a significant increase in scams.","\"It\u2019s just the excitement around memecoins has become ever more tempting for users to try and look for new opportunities, this excitement can tempt users into interacting with malicious actors,\" Natan said.","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Blockaid","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ben Natan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Natan","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Solana","meme coin","Scams","Presales"],"authors":["Oliver Knight"]}
