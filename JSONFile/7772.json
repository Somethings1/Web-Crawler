Bailey answered by turning the focus to Diem.","\u201COne of the things that\u2019s obviously been doing the rounds in the last year or so is this proposal that was called Libra, it\u2019s now called Diem, which has been associated with Facebook,\u201D he said, adding:","\u201CAnd that\u2019s caused quite a few reactions obviously. But one of the issues in that of course is where\u2019s the business model in this thing? And is it actually in the privacy of information, in terms of access to information? Which would not be central banks of course, this would be private sector access to information.\u201D","The proposed stablecoin, formerly known as Libra and initially bootstrapped by social media giant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/14638\/facebook-faces-criticism-for-handling-of-phone-numbers-required-for-2fa\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/86342\/libra-diem-stablecoin-rebrand\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">was rebranded to Diem<\/a> in December, a name the Diem Association\u2019s chief executive Stuart Levey said the move signaled the project\u2019s \u201Cgrowing maturity and independence\u201D.","It is <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-britain-boe-bailey-stablecoins\/bank-of-england-s-bailey-says-stablecoins-do-not-meet-grade-for-broad-use-idUSKBN27S2TO\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">not the first time<\/a> Bailey has appeared to pour cold water on Diem's designs. In November, speaking as part of a European Central Bank panel discussion, the Bank of England governor said, \u201Cthe bar is set very high for private stablecoins, and I don\u2019t think they have met that bar\u201D.","Earlier in the Treasury Committee hearing on January 6, Anil Kashyap, external member of the Financial Policy Committee, which monitors systemic risk to the U.K. financial system, said the Bank of England is planning to publish a discussion paper in March which will lay out the central bank's thinking on CBDCs. &nbsp;","\u201CI think our March paper hopefully will put us in a leadership position vis-à-vis lots of other countries,\u201D he said.","Kashyap also said he doesn\u2019t think it is inevitable that the emergence of retail digital currencies, issued and backed by central banks, will spell the demise of private banking \u2013 which was another area of questioning.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
