While the company is hoping for a V1.0 release in early 2023, it said in a statement that it wanted to give players an \u201Cearly look\u201D at the platform.","\u201CThis first playable build won't have any purchases. It's really about letting people see the start of the world that we're building,\u201D said TetraTiger, Bisonic\u2019s head of marketing.","Players will be able to explore the game\u2019s different regions and hunt for frogs in the Runiverse. These frogs will grant in-game power-ups and an improved spot on the allow list for the upcoming land sale.","Forgotten Runiverse is one of several projects that have started marketing themselves as \u201Ccreate-to-earn,\u201D an alternative to the popular but struggling play-to-earn monetization model that focuses on rewarding players who add value to the community through the creation of items and use of land.","\u201CEach item in the game is unique depending on who makes it, their crafting ability, and the combination of materials used,\" said TetraTiger. \"So you can create a really cool, or really powerful item that you actually on-chain, and then you're at liberty to sell it and earn from your efforts... A player who builds a forge on their plot could gain a crafting fee whenever another player uses it or could sell tickets to a poetry reading or other event in their Guild Hall.\u201D&nbsp;","The launch follows a private <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/141759\/dialectic-seven-seven-six-back-forgotten-runiverse-fundraise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">land sale announced in April<\/a> led by Swiss crypto fund Dialectic.
