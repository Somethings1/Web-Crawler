The app also allows users to add transactions from unsupported exchanges by selecting the \u201DOther\u201D tile from the \u201DSync Exchange\u201D view within the app.","Once users have completed inputting their crypto trading transactions, the app allows users to download a draft Form 8949 and a CSV file detailing their transactions. The service, of course, comes at a cost.","For up to 20 transactions, the cost is $49. For 21\u2013100 transactions, the cost goes up to $99, and for 101\u2013999 transactions, it goes up to $399. For transactions beyond that threshold, EY offers individually priced services.","\u201COur clients increasingly hold and trade crypto assets, creating the need for an innovative solution to address the evolving complexity around filing crypto taxes,\u201D said Marna Ricker, vice-chair of tax services at EY Americas. She added that the CryptoPrep app is created by the EY Foundry, the company\u2019s internal corporate venturing unit.","EY is not the only firm to help U.S. users file crypto taxes. Winklevoss Capital-backed TaxBit also allows users to prepare Form 8949. Other similar services include TokenTax and Koinly."],"hashtag":[]}
