Its new valuation would be more than $30 billion less than at this time last year, when it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/10\/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $639 million<\/a>&nbsp;in a round led by SoftBank.&nbsp;","Klarna's current talks with investors are also a come-down from previous fundraising ambitions, when it reportedly was set to raise <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/fintech-giant-klarna-slashes-fundraising-ambition-11655417674\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$1 billion at a $30 billion valuation.<\/a>","News of the down-round comes amid an employee cull at the company as it suffers during an economic downturn where investors are less willing to make bets on unprofitable companies.
