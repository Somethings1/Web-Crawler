But the company hasn't adopted a new digital asset fair value accounting standard that would\u2019ve given it a sizable profit from bitcoin\u2019s rally at the beginning of the year.","Read more: FASB's Crypto Accounting Shakeup Could Lure More Corporate Investment, Michael Saylor and Others Argue","Vitanza, who attended MicroStrategy\u2019s World 2024 user forum in Las Vegas last week, however, said customers had significant positive feedback regarding the firm\u2019s legacy software business, founded long before Saylor pushed the company to purchase billions of dollars of bitcoin. \u201CThis is causing us to rethink the potential upside around the operating business,\u201D he wrote.","The company\u2019s stock, which is up 89% year-to-date, could also see meaningful upside due to two main catalysts that could drive up the price of bitcoin.","May 15 marks the deadline for institutional investment managers to file form 13-F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If more firms are shown to have purchased the newly approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds during the first quarter, this will show bitcoin has gained further institutional acceptance, the analyst said.","Vitanza said another event that could be positive for bitcoin and, thus, MicroStrategy, will be the SEC's likely rejection of an ether ETF, which many in the industry are girding for.","\u201CThis is significant because while Ethereum's fate may remain up in the air until 2025 or longer, we believe there's a substantial amount of capital waiting for a digital winner to be declared; to the extent Bitcoin proves to be that winner, the incremental demand would likely be felt even more acutely given the recent bitcoin halving,\u201D Vitanza said.","Bitcoin is up 43% since the start of the year and reached a fresh all-time high above $73,000 in March, according to CoinDesk data. It is currently trading at $63,000.","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"$191.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$53.1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$63,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"FASB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Accounting Shakeup Could Lure More Corporate Investment","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vitanza","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"first quarter of 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"the first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$73,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Las Vegas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"43%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"89%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Lance Vitanza","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"TD Cowen","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Saylor","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["MicroStrategy","Bitcoin","Markets","Michael Saylor"],"authors":["Helene Braun"]}
