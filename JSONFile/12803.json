Institutional and retail trading will launch shortly after, Kaplan said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Prometheum's steps forward come as the SEC has consistently warned that crypto exchanges need to register with the agency. Over the past year, it's charged Coinbase, Binance and Kraken for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, dealer and clearinghouse. Meanwhile, crypto firms have argued that it's not possible to register with the agency.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Prometheum itself has faced the ire of the industry, with probes coming from the Blockchain Association and Republican lawmakers.
