But, Coin Center argues, a smart contract, unlike other designated entities, cannot challenge a designation from the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control in court.","\"This action sends a signal\u2014indeed seems to have been intended to send a signal\u2014that a certain class of tools and software should not be used by Americans even for entirely legitimate purposes,\" the blog says.&nbsp;","Laying out its plan for removing the designation, Coin Center promised that its first step was to engage OFAC.
