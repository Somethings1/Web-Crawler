Users will have the authority to choose the exact channels to place their TON-powered ads, the <a href=\"https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/monetization-for-channels?ln=r\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announcement<\/a> stated.","Furthermore, channel owners will be able to withdraw their rewards without fees, while the withdrawal service will become available in the coming weeks on Telegram\u2019s Fragment exchange, according to the announcement.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe chose the TON Blockchain because it has low fees, high transaction speeds \u2013 and holds a record for the number of transactions it can process per second,\u201D Telegram wrote in the announcement.
