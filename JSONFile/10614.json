The sidechain incorporates a bridged version of DAI, known as xDAI, as its native currency.<\/span>","This deployment marks Spark Protocol's initial foray beyond Ethereum and the beginning of its multi-chain strategy, offering the DAI savings rate on the sidechain as well. The move represents the first time a MakerDAO-affiliated DeFi product has been launched on a blockchain other than Ethereum.","Subsequent to the deployment, contributors to Gnosis Chain approved a measure to transfer most of the DAI on its bridge with the Ethereum Mainnet into Spark Protocol's sDAI vault. The arrangement allows xDAI holders to continue accessing the Dai Savings Rate yield available on the mainnet, whereas prior to the proposal, contributors had noticed a drop in DAI being moved to the mainnet to access Spark.","Â© 2023 The Block.
