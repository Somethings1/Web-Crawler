It is categorized as a hot wallet because it is directly connected to the internet. The app is only available on iOS and Android devices and is relatively simple to set up and use.","Trust Wallet was acquired by Binance in 2018 to be its official decentralized wallet. It has the ability to store over 4.5 million digital assets and supports over 65 blockchains. Being a popular wallet among traders and investors, it has been downloaded over 30 million times to date.","Though Binance\u2019s Trust Wallet is compatible with various blockchains, Trust Wallet distinguishes itself from other popular wallets due to its interoperability with virtually all platforms based on Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) such as PancakeSwap.","Read more: Your First Crypto Wallet","Once you download the app, there are a few simple steps to get started.","1. Select \u201CCreate a new wallet\u201D and press \u201CContinue\u201D to accept the terms.

A new screen will appear, prompting you to write down your recovery phrase. It is important you manually write it down and keep it in a safe, private place. Keeping the words in digital form is less secure and not recommended.","3. The recovery phase for Trust Wallet consists of 12 words. These words will be used in case you lose access to your wallet \u2013 and they are the only way to regain access to the wallet. So we\u2019ll say it again: Keep them in a safe, private place.","Read More: Why Your Seed Phrase Is So Important","4.
