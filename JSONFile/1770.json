It also claims to have an order entry and response time of \u201Cless than 1 millisecond.\u201D <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAvailable for both retail and institutional clients, Singapore-based Phemex offers several cryptocurrency perpetual contracts, tied to bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, litecoin (LTC) and EOS, with up to 100 times leverage.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CThese trading metrics are on par with those experienced at some big investment banks like Morgan Stanley. Our matching engine, trading engine, and risk engine were six months in the making, putting the platform technically on par with Nasdaq,\u201D said Jack Tao, who spent 11 years at Morgan Stanley as the global development leader of the bank\u2019s electronic trading benchmark execution strategies, before co-founding Phemex.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nTao brought in seven other executives as well from Morgan Stanley to join his venture.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Traditional finance to crypto&nbsp;<\/strong>","But why a shift to crypto from traditional finance? Mostly for two reasons, Tao told The Block. \u201CFirst, we believe that the derivatives market has great potential for growth, this belief was supported by our research during the initial stages of Phemex. Second, coming from traditional finance, where technical standards are considerably higher, we see plenty of room for improvement.\u201D","Tao acknowledged that the crypto derivatives market is \u201Ccrowded,\u201D but said \u201Congoing news of technical and security issues regarding major exchanges are also very common. This tells us that our expertise can bring value to the industry.\u201D <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nPhemex is built using C++ and React programming languages, while some other crypto trading platforms are engineered in Kdb+, a column-based relational time-series database, said Phemex, adding: \u201CWhile extremely efficient in calculating orders, costs and risks, Kdb+ presents exchanges with reliability issues due to scalability and transaction throughput limitations.\u201D <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nIn July, the world\u2019s largest crypto wallet provider Blockchain.com also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/33842\/wallet-provider-blockchain-rolls-out-crypto-exchange-claiming-to-be-one-of-the-fastest-in-the-market\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> a crypto exchange called The PIT, claiming to be one of the fastest in the world. But is speed really important? Insiders told The Block at the time that speed isn't a top priority for most investors in the market. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nPhemex also offers a \u201Ccold\u201D wallet, which assigns an independent deposit address to each user, per the announcement.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Looking back and ahead<\/strong> <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe whole process of building Phemex took around six months, Tao told The Block, adding that the platform opened registrations ten days ago. So far, some 2,000 users have signed up for Phemex and Tao is \u201Csatisfied\u201D with the turnout. \u201COur target for H1 is at least 20,000 users,\u201D he added.","Phemex charges trading fees of -0.025% (maker) and 0.0075% (taker), and withdrawal fee of 0.0005 bitcoin, said Tao, adding that the platform currently prevents IP addresses from the U.S., meaning residents of the country cannot trade.&nbsp;","There are currently 40 people working for Phemex and the exchange is looking to expand its presence in \u201Cmany different markets soon\u201D with plans to hire more staff. To that end, the $30-million valuation firm is raising more funds, Tao told The Block, declining to comment on how much Phemex has already raised to date.","\"As all of our competitors in the derivatives field, we are currently unregulated,\" Tao told The Block. But there are already regulated crypto derivatives exchanges in the space, including CME and Bakkt. Phemex also has plans to acquire a license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said Tao, adding: \"Additionally, we are planning to collaborate with SEBA for the custody of our customer's assets.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nJust last month, the MAS <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/47706\/singapores-financial-regulator-proposes-to-allow-trading-of-crypto-derivatives-on-approved-exchanges-due-to-institutional-interest\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposed<\/a> to allow the listing and trading of cryptocurrency derivatives on approved local exchanges, due to interest from institutional investors.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CIn the future, we would like to provide our users with the option to trade contracts backed by traditional financial products: FOREX, S&amp;P, commodities, etc., Tao said. \"It is a long process in terms of regulations and licensing but we are targeting early 2020 for the release of these features.\""],"hashtag":["XRP"]}
