The first leg down in the price gave way to a recovery to 97 cents. This leg up was, however, short-lived as the stablecoin plunged again.","The depegging event has also led to a reduction in the liquidity available for trading HUSD. This shrinking liquidity is likely due to traders exiting their HUSD positions.","HUSD\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/curve.fi\/husd\/withdraw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">liquidity<\/a> on the Curve 3pool (3Crv) \u2014 the largest liquidity pool on the decentralized exchange Curve \u2014 has become unbalanced. The currency reserve breakdown for the pool is now at a ratio of 92% HUSD to 7.35% 3Crv which is the most unbalanced this pool has ever been. An unbalanced pool means that there is not enough liquidity to honor swaps for one token in the pool.","In this case, HUSD is becoming more illiquid as there are not enough 3Crv tokens to swap in exchange for the depegged stablecoin. 3Crv is a stablecoin pool that contains deposits of the three largest stablecoins USDT, USDC, and DAI.","The Huobi-backed Stable Universal has stated in previous attestations that HUSD was wholly backed by cash reserves.
