In fact, it was part of a larger TikTok-centered campaign to inflate the coin's price.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CDogecoin is practically worthless,\u201D he explained. \u201CThere are 800 million TikTok users, invest just $25.

Tell everyone you know.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The video, which has garnered roughly 63K likes and 5,000 comments, is far from the only one. A quick search of the Dogecoin TikTok tag shows that users on the social media platform have, in aggregate, created videos that garnered over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/dogecoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">5 million views<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The cryptocurrency also took the top trending spot on Twitter late Tuesday night.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dogecoin is a Litecoin-based cryptocurrency that was launched as a joke in December 2013 by U.S.-based programmers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who borrowed the name and logo from an internet meme. Since then, somewhat of a cult community has formed around the coin, predominantly on Reddit and Twitter.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The current price of Dogecoin is at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/price\/dogecoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$0.0037<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, after peaking at $0.0048 on Tuesday. But since the morning of July 6 through the present, the price has increased by approximately 60%, making its $450 million market cap the 29th largest among cryptocurrencies.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The coin\u2019s recent TikTok-fueled rise appears to be enticing users to jump on the bandwagon even if they don\u2019t understand the asset, much less crypto investing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CEverybody listen to me,\u201D a Tik Tok user who goes by the name <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@kindashortidiot\/video\/6846526323490327814\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hunter<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> said in another video. \u201CThis is Dogecoin. If you know nothing about investing, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Go put $25 into this and that will be 10,000 shares okay. And if this reaches $1, you would have made $10,000. Please just try it out. Go pump it!\u201D he said. The video, which was released Monday, has over 45K likes and over 2,400 comments. <\/span>"],"hashtag":["DOGECOIN"]}
