The bank has opened up the position to get expert advice on how to design a secure solution for \"managing crypto keys.\"","The job includes managing the installation of a hardware security module (HSM) \u2014 a dedicated hardware device to protect cryptographic keys, setting up a \"centralized\" key management solution, and maintaining crypto keys, among other responsibilities.","Applicants should have a clear understanding and experience of HSM devices, encryption standards, cryptographic key generation and management, and payment network standards, including tokenization, per the job requirements.","\"It's quite possible that UOB is working on a crypto custody solution. The likelihood is that all major banks are looking into this type of offering in some way. But this position may not be related to digital assets,\" Hagen Rooke, fintech counsel at Singapore-based law firm Reed Smith, told The Block. \"It seems to be related to the use of cryptography for the purposes of developing security solutions in a banking context. This also involves developing 'tokens,' i.e., encoded representations of confidential information.\"","UOB declined to comment to The Block when asked whether the bank\u2019s job application relates to cryptocurrency or if it is developing a crypto custody solution.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rival plans&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong>","The job comes as UOB rival DBS, Singapore's biggest bank, is preparing to launch its own crypto exchange and crypto custody solution.
