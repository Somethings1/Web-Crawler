The researchers argue that \"the adjustments in private financial arrangements in response to a CBDC may tend to stabilize rather than destabilize the financial system.\"","The paper took aim at the concern that a CBDC would facilitate bank runs by incentivizing deposit holders to take their money out of banks. It's a common criticism of CBDCs. Many skeptics of CBDCs are generally fearful of the damage a direct digital link with the Federal Reserve would do to commercial banks.&nbsp;","However, the authors don't do much to assuage concerns that a CBDC could become a tool of government surveillance.

Regulators might not immediately observe these withdrawals and, even if they do, might have difficultly distinguishing them from the regular inflows and outflows generated by a bank\u2019s client transactions.
