Corporate and decentralized currencies like Bitcoin will compete with national fiat currencies","The ability of the state to wage war even on supposedly much weaker adversaries has become way more costly","The internet has allowed for information to be spread widely in a way that was previously only available to state actors","Normally I try to avoid speculating on the medium-term or far future\u2014my job is to speculate on the relatively near future (5 years or so), and I know first hand how hard that is to do well. But if you\u2019ll indulge me in a bit of long-term speculation for the length of this email, I\u2019d like to think out loud a bit about what\u2019s happening to state power as a direct result of technology. I also won\u2019t bother to hide my glee about these developments\u2014as a Jew I have a deep-seated distrust of nation states, and I\u2019ve been dismayed by the increasing power that surveillance and weapons technologies have granted to state actors. That the tide is changing now is a source of deep joy for me, and a strong motivator to keep me investing in this space (as if the moongainz weren\u2019t enough, haha)","The first and most obvious trend is that of cryptocurrencies eroding the State\u2019s ability to print money. This started with Bitcoin, and was&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=2216056.0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">clearly part of Satoshi\u2019s intent<\/a>&nbsp;in releasing the Bitcoin software. Unsurprisingly, this is becoming most apparent in countries with extremely weak fiat currencies like Venezuela\u2014and also, it happens slowly (then fast) because the fiat financial system resists outflows pretty well. But at the end of the day it\u2019s a leaky bucket, and the cat is not going back into the bag on this one. The money landscape in Dec 2008 was entirely national fiat currencies\u2014in January 2009 it suddenly included a decentralized digital currency. In January 2019, Bitcoin and a plethora of altcoins exist. In January 2029, I suspect that FacebookCoin style corporate currencies, decentralized currencies like Bitcoin, and national fiat currencies will all be competing, with the former two categories making up a very large chunk of world commerce.","The second ongoing trend is the inability of state defense agencies to deal with what William Gibson termed \u201Can increase in individual lethal agency.\u201D Put simply, the number of people one determined individual can kill if they want to is increasing and shows no signs of slowing down. From a State power perspective, this means that waging war even on supposedly much weaker adversaries is way more costly, because they can respond asymmetrically e.g. through terror attacks.","The final trend that seems to be reducing state power is the existence of the Internet as an information dissemination tool. This one is a bit of a mixed bag\u2014the internet permits surveillance that increases state power, but it also permits people to share information widely in a way that was previously only available to state actors. I think on balance this will end up decreasing state power; surveillance will become more and more difficult as financial transactions move onto things like Mobilecoin, Zcash etc and as communications increasingly are over end-to-end encrypted open source tools like Signal; at the same time, the tools of mass influence will be wielded increasingly by non-state actors (corporations, small interest groups, etc).","One of the main differences between people who have been in the crypto space for a long time and people who are relatively new is the degree to which they understand that cryptocurrencies are inherently an anti-state technology, and need to be built from the ground up to withstand multi-state attacks. At the moment, very few if any cryptocurrencies meet this bar (although Bitcoin is by far the closest). Naval Ravikant referred to the State as the \u201Cfinal boss\u201D for crypto; I agree with that assessment and think that the boss fight may be coming sooner than people think.","More next week.
