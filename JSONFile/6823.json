Over the last few years,&nbsp; EVM has become the most widely adopted computing standard for developing smart contracts.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Neon's implementation will be a smart contract platform built on top of Solana that lets developers deploy Ethereum-based applications \u2014 something that\u2019s not been possible so far on the network.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Solana\u2019s existing smart contract framework is not EVM-compatible. Therefore developing Ethereum apps on Solana isn\u2019t possible. Neon wants to change that by adopting the developer tools and compute layer present on Ethereum, thereby reducing friction for Ethereum developers looking to expand to Solana.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Ethereum-based projects can, for the first time, tap into the previously inaccessible audience and liquidity of Solana without needing to rewrite their code in Rust,\" Marina Guryeva, CEO and Founder of Neon Labs, said. As a result, users will now get to enjoy enhanced user experiences on Solana without losing out on Ethereum\u2019s battle-tested dApps,\" they added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Notable Ethereum-based projects \u2014 including Aave, Curve, and Sobal \u2014 are gearing up for launch on Neon EVM once its mainnet launch goes live.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Last year, Neon Labs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/123744\/neon-labs-developer-of-ethereum-virtual-machine-on-solana-raises-40-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a><\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> $40 million<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> from Jump Capital, IDEO CoLab Ventures and Solana Capital, amongst others.<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
