Restaking and LRTs, however, could pose added risks compared to existing staking products, both from a financial and security perspective, Coinbase said.","Read more: Liquid Restaking Tokens: What Are They and Why Do They Matter?\n\n\u201CThe adoption of LRT wrappers around the underlying protocol could lead to hidden risks from nontransparent staking strategies or temporary dislocations from their underlying,\u201D the authors wrote, adding that the \u201Cinitial yield from AVSs may not live up to the extremely high expectations set by the market.\u201D","The report also pointed out that stakers will go where the LRT providers offer the highest rewards. This could lead to additional risks as these providers will try to maximize rewards by restaking multiple times to attract more users. \"We believe what matters will be the risk-adjusted rewards and not absolute rewards, but it may be difficult to have transparency on that. This could lead to additional risks as LRT DAOs are incentivized to maximally restake multiple times to remain competitive.\"","However, Coinbase says despite these risks, \u201Crestaking champions the open innovation of Ethereum and will become a core part of the ecosystem\u2019s infrastructure.\u201D\n\nRead more: Ethereum\u2019s Rising Validator Count is Causing Concerns, Fidelity Digital Assets Says","Edited by Aoyon Ashraf.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"David Han","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Aoyon Ashraf","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"David Duong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$12.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"LRT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum\u2019s Rising Validator Count","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Restaking","EigenLayer","ethererum","ETH"],"authors":["Will Canny"]}
