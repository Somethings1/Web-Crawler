Those without master accounts are often forced to rely on partner banks with master accounts to provide services.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"If Custodia's position was correct, it would effectively mean that every depository institution chartered under the laws of a state, regardless of how soundly crafted, is entitled to a master account allowing it direct access to the federal financial system,\" the judge said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to the court document, Custodia alleged that the Federal Reserve Board violated the Administrative Procedures Act and said its actions were \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\" Custodia asked the judge to compel the board to issue a master account. The APA <\/span><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">governs how federal agencies develop and issue rules.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The court stamped out the APA claim, in part because the board did not take a final action.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Custodia is not statutorily entitled to a master account, the judge said<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The real dispute at the heart of this case is whether FRBKC must grant a master account to Custodia because it was legally eligible or whether FRBKC possessed the discretion to deny Custodia's master account application despite its eligibility,\" the judge said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Custodia filed its application with the Kansas City Fed in 2020.
