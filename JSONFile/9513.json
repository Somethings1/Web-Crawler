Since the attack, developers have put out an emergency release to fix the bug and have promised the treasury will be used to make the liquidity providers whole.","The exploit was announced around 10:23 UTC, with initial reports estimating the size of the hack at around 13,000 ETH ($24 million), before this was revised to around 4,000 ETH ($7.4 million), and then later to around $4.9 million.

Its \"chaosnet\" is effectively a cross-chain decentralized exchange. Thorchain is used by exchanges such as ShapeShift, which is going <a href=\"https:\/\/erikvoorhees.medium.com\/shapeshift-is-decentralizing-639bb4c82fc8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fully decentralized<\/a>.","When the attack was noticed, nodes running the network halted it, preventing the attack from getting worse.
