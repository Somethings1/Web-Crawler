The tweet was picked up and shared rapidly among many crypto influencers who encouraged people to buy the NFTs and support the artist.&nbsp;","Yet it was quickly discovered by some Twitter users including web3 artist <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArcanicNFT\/status\/1663732042121773056\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arcanic <\/a>that the account was simply reselling work from other artists such as&nbsp;as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lancelotli2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Snooow<\/a>. Arcanic also highlighted that the same account had been used to run similar tactics, such as claiming their wife had cancer and were trying to get out of debt.&nbsp;","The Twitter account was deleted once the scam was widely discovered, but not before the NFT project had raised around 63.5 ether ($119,000). The funds were <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/zachxbt\/status\/1663753427095101440\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">transferred<\/a> to other wallets, according to crypto sleuth ZachXBT. He claimed they may have been sent to crypto exchange OKX.","\u201CWe as a community came together to support someone with a heart-wrenching story. For half a day it felt good and genuine again,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/xBenJamminx\/status\/1663708400218193923\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> a crypto individual known as BenJammin who initially shared the NFT project.&nbsp;","\u201CI\u2019m tired of this shit, I joined this Web3 space because of the quest for knowledge, community and vibes. Now it\u2019s a cesspool of scammers,\u201D they added.","Arcanic also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArcanicNFT\/status\/1663732048983367682\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">weighed<\/a> in, saying that the ordeal had been \"a gut-punch to everyone trying to do some good in space so riddled with drama and grifters. But I think that despite this, we shouldn't get rid of our empathy either.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
