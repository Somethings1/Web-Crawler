It plans to do this by using NFTs as the cookies of the Web 3.0 ecosystem, using the tokens to support what the company calls \"the development of commercial and industrial NFTs.\"","\"Snickerdoodle is about reimagining the internet and empowering individuals,\" Padilla said in an interview with The Block. \"This is a completely novel idea.\"","Padilla said while the platform is designed for the creation of commercial and industrial NFTs, NFT creators can benefit too. He said Snickerdoodle is already talking to a number of artists and said this is simply another way for them to generate revenue by having their content plug into multiple mediums. He said the infrastructure Snickerdoodle eventually builds will lend creators more multi-functionality.&nbsp;","\u201CWhile the NFT ecosystem has seen a dramatic uptick in engagement over the last year, what\u2019s missing is a dependable way to ensure true data ownership and privacy alongside secure and voluntary data commerce. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re building,\u201D he said.&nbsp;","The startup said it plans to host a token offering this summer to \"further capitalize\" its development and growth.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":[]}
