We've observed a declining ratio for longer-dated expiries, which suggests that clients are using calls more frequently for positioning toward the March and June 2024 expiries. This trend indicates a longer-term bullish sentiment in the market, with a growing number of calls versus puts outstanding,\" Strijers told The Block.","A put-call options ratio below one indicates that the call volume exceeds the put volume, signifying bullish sentiment in the market.

A call option gives the right to buy and a put offers the right to sell. It is assumed that a trader who buys call options is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
