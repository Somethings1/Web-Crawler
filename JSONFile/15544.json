He is a partner at Levy Firestone Muse and created cryptowhistleblower.com.","\u201CWell, here at the SEC,\u201D Gensler warned, \u201Cwe want to make sure that these folks are telling the truth.\u201D","The same day, the SEC announced it had settled charges with two investment advisors: Delphia and Global Predictions. The SEC\u2019s order sanctioned the \u201Crobo advisor business\u201D Delphia, which held $187 million in assets under management, for allegedly making claims it used \u201Cmachine learning to analyze the collective data shared by its members to make intelligent investment decisions.\u201D","That wasn\u2019t true when Delphia first made those claims in a December 2019 press release, and it wouldn\u2019t become true as it continued to make similar claims well into 2023, according to the SEC.","The second company settling with the SEC, Global Predictions, claimed to use \u201C[e]xpert AI driven forecasts,\u201D when, according to the agency's blunt assessment, \u201Cin fact it did not.\u201D Asked by the SEC to substantiate its claim to be the \u201Cfirst regulated AI financial advisor,\u201D Global Predictions \u201Ccould not produce documents\u201D to do so.","Collectively, the two companies paid fines totaling $400,000, not a lot by SEC standards, but this is a shot across the bow, a warning that the SEC won\u2019t tolerate AI washing.","The SEC is right to be aggressive. As of Jan. 18, there were 353,928 .ai domain names registered. How many of those 353,928 domains belong to a company that actually uses AI?","Admittedly, AI is a broad category. IBM, for example, defines AI as \u201Ctechnology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities.\u201D When, as one commentator has asked, \u201Cdoes something go from being a Fax machine to being Samantha from Her or HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey? Where do we draw the line?\u201D","See also: Daren Firestone \u2014 AI+Crypto: Trouble | Opinion","The SEC will aim to avoid such esoterica by targeting lies that it can prove in court. Another example: in February, the SEC filed a complaint against Brian Sewell and his company Rockwell Capital Management LLC. Sewell allegedly raised $1.2 million for a fund to invest in cryptocurrency trading that he claimed would employ \u201Cmachine algorithms,\u201D \u201Cartificial intelligence\u201D and a \u201Cmachine learning model.\u201D","\u201CIn reality,\u201D the SEC alleged, \u201CSewell and the Fund had none of these things.\u201D","AI is the next big thing. Investors know that. So do fraudsters seeking to take advantage of investor enthusiasm. The SEC is right to send a warning to those fraudsters."],"entity":[{"type":"Delphia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$400,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2001","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sewell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jan. 18","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Daren Firestone","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Levy Firestone Muse","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"IBM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brian Sewell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Rockwell Capital Management LLC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$187 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","AI","Law","SEC","Regulation"],"authors":["Daren Firestone"]}
