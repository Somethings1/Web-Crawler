U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams issued a stark warning to those who participated in wrongdoing at FTX or Alameda Research to \u201Ccome see us before we come see you\u201D at a press conference in December.","\u201CThis is the classic strategy used by prosecutors since the dawn of time,\u201D Sabino said. \u201CYou go after the little fish, who gets you the medium-sized fish, who gets you the big fish.\u201D","Bankman-Fried, whose crypto empire was once valued at $32 billion, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges and could face decades in jail if he is convicted. A spokesperson declined to comment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The former billionaire is accused of mishandling FTX customer assets to prop up his trading firm, Alameda Research, along with making illegal political donations and other crimes.&nbsp;","Days before Singh pleaded guilty, Bankman-Fried was hit with a superseding indictment that held four new charges, including bank fraud. The court filing included new details about Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged political donations scheme, which included references two unnamed co-conspirators who took hefty loans from Alameda Research and gave money to political groups on either side of the aisle.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Singh, who was not named as a co-conspirator in any court documents, gave millions to political causes during the 2022 campaign cycle.

FTX US General Counsel Ryne Miller declined to comment via his lawyer. Bankman-Fried has been accused by prosecutors of contacting an FTX lawyer, who is also a potential witness in the case, via an encrypted app. Court documents did not disclose the name of employee whom Bankman-Fried contacted, but a judge amended his terms of bail to prevent him from future contact without outside lawyers present. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Others close to Bankman-Fried may feel more pressure to talk with prosecutors now that Ellison, Wang and Singh have pleaded guilty, Sabino said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CThey've already pled guilty. They've made a deal. That leaves less room for these folks to make a deal,\u201D Sabino said. \u201CIf they want to keep themselves out of prison for the rest of their lives, they better be moving fast and having some serious hard-knock discussions with the government at this point about the parameters of a plea deal.\u201D","Singh\u2019s cooperation could be key for prosecutors working to prove criminal intent when Bankman-Fried goes to trial in October.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CWhen Nishad pled guilty, he admitted that going back to mid-2022, he knew that FTX was improperly loaning funds to Alameda. This is really a key point because the prosecutors, in their case against Bankman-Fried, they have to prove criminal intent and that Bankman-Fried deliberately was breaking the law,\u201D said Robert Heim, a partner at the law firm Tarter Krinsky<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> &amp; Drogin.<\/span> Heim added that prosecutors now have a cooperator in Singh that can corroborate that he, and possibly Bankman-Fried, knew that investor funds were being diverted to Alameda.","<span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Prosecutors have been strategic in making plea deals, Heim added, receiving<\/span> cooperation from insiders at both FTX and Alameda Research, the two companies where client funds were allegedly commingled and mishandled.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Though civil charges filed by U.S. markets regulators on Tuesday, with bifurcated settlements from Singh to the charges, went further in shedding light as to how little separation there may have been between the two companies.&nbsp;<\/span>","The SEC charged the 27-year-old with defrauding investors, saying the former director of engineering at FTX created a software code that allowed FTX customer funds to go to Alameda Research. The regulator also said Singh was told by Bankman-Fried to \u201Cfalsely characterize\u201D millions in revenue and move funds in order to reach a $1 billion annual revenue goal. Singh also lied to auditors about those transfers, the agency said.","Singh consented to a \u201Cbifurcated settlement\u201D regarding the SEC charges, which awaits a court\u2019s approval.","At this point experts say, given the witnesses that prosecutors have now, even if Bankman-Fried decides to cooperate it's not clear prosecutors would go easy on him.","\u201CBankman-Fried is the poster boy for criminal misconduct in the crypto space. So part of what the prosecutors want to do here is send a very strong message of deterrence to other people,\u201D Heim said. \u201CWhen it comes to plea negotiations, it comes down to how severe the prison sentence is going to be.\u201D","There\u2019s also no guarantee that prosecutors would even accept a plea deal.","\u201CThe government can very well turn around and say, 'No, we're not interested. You know why? Because we don't need you to plead. We've got you cold, we\u2019re going to put you on trial and we\u2019re basically going to crucify you,\u201D Sabino said.","For his part, Bankman-Fried hasn't presented the image of someone who might cooperate with law enforcement. Prosecutors have urged the federal judge presiding over his criminal case to curtail Bankman-Fried\u2019s internet access after he used Signal to contact a former employee and potential witness. They also raised concerns over his use of a virtual private network, which Bankman-Fried's lawyers claim was necessary to watch the Super Bowl.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> The judge presiding over the case has agreed to temporarily limit some of Bankman-Fried's contact with former employees, and use of private messaging apps, before making a formal decision on limiting internet access. <\/span>","Despite the scrutiny of his internet use, days after his last court appearance Bankman-Fried followed a Twitter fan page for the infamous Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff titled \u201C@MadoffOnlyFans,\u201D an account that has since been deactivated.&nbsp;","\u201CIt's hard to believe that he is not taking it seriously.
