A reentrancy vulnerability in a smart contract happens when an attacker repeatedly calls a function and extracts assets from it before the contract updates its internal state. The vulnerability can result from a bug in the smart contract or from insufficient security measures.","The Orion Protocol team acknowledged the hack and temporarily paused its deposit function. Orion Protocol CEO, Alexey Koloskov, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexeykoloskov\/status\/1621269283178160128\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claimed<\/a> that users did not lose any funds, only the company's funds were taken. \"We want to reassure our users that no user experienced any loss during this incident.\"","Koloskov <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexeykoloskov\/status\/1621269268959477763\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">added<\/a> that the vulnerability may have been introduced due to the development team's use of third-party software libraries to write the smart contracts.
