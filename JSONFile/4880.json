Of the top wallets reviewed, a large number were heavy users of blue chip DeFi apps and DEX aggregators; among major asset holdings as of Aug. 7, they also had exposure to the Telegram bot project Unibot, memecoins like Pepe and Toshi, and the on-chain gaming application Rollbit.","\u201COut of the top entities interacted with, most of them are very commonly used DEXs, aggregators, or blue-chip protocols. Interestingly, Unibot is also in the top 10 by the unique number of wallets, suggesting a strong product-market fit for traders,\u201D Nansen analysts said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/research.nansen.ai\/articles\/what-are-early-base-whales-doing-on-chain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">research report<\/a> shared with The Block.","These early Base whales were identified as primarily crypto-native individuals who contributed by depositing at least 100 ETH ($185,000) to Base via a bridge contract. Users had bridged a total of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243379\/bridged-assets-to-coinbases-layer-2-top-100-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$100 million<\/a> in total value even before Base\u2019s launch.","Nansen analysts classified the users as crypto-savvy but having \u201Cdegen\u201D tendencies, given the on-chain behavior of shuffling across assets within a short span of time. The term is frequently used to describe risky and speculative behavior, often without much due diligence.&nbsp;","\u201CEarly Base bridgers are an interesting segment given they were early to another chain and likely crypto-native. These wallets had to interact with the bridge smart contract itself since there was no frontend for bridging before August 3. Given this, we can likely assume a lot of the early Base depositors are crypto-native degens,\u201D the Nansen analysts <a href=\"https:\/\/research.nansen.ai\/articles\/what-are-early-base-whales-doing-on-chain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>.","A large number of the wallets tracked also owned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/242225\/bald-memecoin-developer-liquidity-pull\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bald memecoin<\/a> as of August 7, Nansen noted, although this token dropped to zero after its developer drained liquidity from its pool.","Base\u2019s developer-only mainnet went <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239393\/coinbase-base-mainnet-developers?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">live<\/a> on July 13 and was primarily accessible to developers.
