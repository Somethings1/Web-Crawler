The cryptocurrency is up 82% year-to-date and recently registered its best quarterly increase in two years. The rise in bitcoin has been linked to the prospect of interest rate increases peaking amid banking stress in the U.S. and across Europe.","The surge in prices has pushed the price of bitcoin above MicroStrategy's average purchase price of $29,803. While that means the company is technically up, it's only by a few hundreds dollars, which is a small buffer. Since the company owns so much bitcoin, if it was sold in a short period of time, it would likely push the price down significantly in the process. This means the company likely wouldn't be able to sell all of its bitcoin for a profit yet if it wanted to.","MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings have been in the red since last June. At the time, the collapse of crypto lender Celsius and the failure of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital propelled the markets down even further. During this time, the U.S. Federal Reserve also increased interest rates to combat rising inflation.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/public-companies\/microstrategy-bitcoin-holdings\/embed\" title=\"MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Recent bitcoin purchases lowered MicroStrategy's average purchase price.
