It aims to provide a framework for the development of Layer 2 blockchains that can operate on the Ethereum network.","According to Polygon Labs, Layer 2 blockchains deployed using its CDK will have the ability to connect to a shared ZK bridge \u2014 allowing for interoperability.&nbsp;","\u201CAny developer deploying a chain using the Polygon CDK will be launching a ZK-powered L2 on Ethereum. By connecting to a shared ZK bridge, every chain is also seamlessly interoperable \u2014 connected to every other,\u201D Polygon Labs noted.","The codebase for the CDK will be open-sourced, the firm stated.","\"Polygon CDK is the evolution of Supernets, which offered projects the ability to operate sidechain-like appchain protocols,\" the team added. \"Using CDK, all existing Supernets can upgrade their current architecture to the industry-leading Polygon ZK technology.\"","The toolkit will support what is called as \"Interop Layer,\" a new protocol being developed by Polygon Labs that will aggregate zero-knowledge proofs from multiple Polygon chains and secure them together by generating with the Ethereum mainnet. This layer also serves as a coordinator for the states of various Layer 2 chains, ensuring composability across them.","Recently, Polygon Labs has been involved in developing individual chains for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221420\/polygon-to-help-develop-immutable-zkevm-secured-by-matic-stakers)\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Immutable<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238140\/idex-unveils-a-zkevm-layer-2-chain-based-on-polygon-supernets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IDEX<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241693\/palm-network-polygon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Palm Network<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221942\/gaming-project-aavegotchi-to-release-own-blockchain-with-polygon-supernets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aavegotchi<\/a>. With Polygon 2.0, the emphasis will shift towards creating more interconnected chains, leading to an ecosystem akin to Cosmos and Polkadot but targeting Ethereum Layer 2 developers.","Â© 2023 The Block.
