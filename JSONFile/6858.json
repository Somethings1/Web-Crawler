The refund includes an investment from YGG founder Gabby Dizon\u2019s personal fund, Nifty \u2014 which the DAO had initially voted to return, alongside cancelling YGG\u2019s s0-called Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT).","MC and YGG described the deal as \u201Ca solution that still satisfies the will of the Merit Circle community, but was also acceptable to YGG.\u201D","YGG was one of several investors in the fledgling DAO in September last year. However, it became the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/148428\/merit-circle-yield-guild-games-dao-dispute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">center of debate at the MC DAO<\/a> after it was criticized by a member named HoneyBarrel for failing to prove its value to the community beyond financial support.","Both YGG and MC disputed this characterization and claimed that YGG had provided support, including introductions to other investors.","The case has attracted attention as a landmark test for the absolute power of DAO decision making. Both within and without the DAO, concerns were raised about the precedent the decision could set and the legal and reputational implications of removing an investor.","As a result, Merit Circle has hinted that changes in governance could be on the way.","\u201CWe have a lot of governance improvements in mind that should avoid explosive situations like this in the future and will mitigate the potential doubts parties could have around agreements with DAOs. Of course, we will also rely on input from the community and from external stakeholders to come to the best models,\u201D it said in a statement.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
