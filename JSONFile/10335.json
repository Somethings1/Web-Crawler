Similar to SaaS(Software-as-a-Servic) products, RaaS allows developers to focus on building the application layer, transforming what used to be a process requiring multiple engineers and dozens of hours into a 10-minute no-code deployment.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There are two main types of Rollups:<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/alexandria\/glossary\/optimistic-rollup\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Optimistic rollups<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/alexandria\/glossary\/zero-knowledge-rollups\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ZK-Rollups<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. They differ in transaction verification and dispute resolution, with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Based on the type of Rollup offered, this article divides RaaS into <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Op-RaaS<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ZK-RaaS<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One of the primary objectives of Rollup solutions is to increase the transaction throughput on L1 and reduce users' gas fees. Both Optimistic rollups and ZK-Rollups achieve this goal by batching transactions and periodically submitting them to the L1. Consequently, they both incur gas fees for submitting data to L1.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Therefore, ZK-Rollups can save more L1 Gas compared to optimistic rollups.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, ZK-Rollups entail additional computation costs for generating zero-knowledge proofs, which is exactly what ZK-RaaS aims to address.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As ZK-Rollups are being adopted on a large scale, generating ZKPs requires significant computational power from hardware and mining machines, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/opsi.de\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Opside<\/span><\/a> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has also introduced the concept of<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ethresear.ch\/t\/opside-zk-pow-v2-0-a-multi-chain-and-multi-rollup-decentralized-prover-network\/16034\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ZK-PoW<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, involving miners in maintaining zkEVM nodes and performing ZKP calculations.

This significantly accelerates the efficiency of ZKP generation.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Due to the challenge period in optimistic rollups, users cannot withdraw funds before its expiration, causing inconvenience. In contrast, ZK-Rollups lack a challenge period, offering users superior fund\/liquidity efficiency, allowing them to withdraw funds at any time.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It's worth noting that <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">due to the swift confirmation of transactions in ZK-Rollups, it's possible to achieve trustless communication between ZK-Rollups, allowing all Rollups to share asset liquidity<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. However, due to the presence of a 7-day challenge period and fraud proofs, achieving trustless native communication between optimistic rollups is impractical.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Opside's ZK-RaaS platform introduces the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ethresear.ch\/t\/opsides-ncrc-a-trustless-native-cross-rollup-communication-protocol\/16441\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NCRC (Native Cross Rollup Communication)<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> protocol, providing a trustless Rollup interoperability solution. The NCRC protocol doesn't involve adding an additional third-party bridge to each Rollup; instead, it transforms the native bridge of ZK-Rollups at the system level. This enables direct utilization of the native bridges of various ZK-Rollups for cross-Rollup communication. This approach is not only more concise and comprehensive but also inherits the absolute security of native bridges while avoiding the complexity and trust costs associated with third-party bridges.<\/span>","Opside has successfully implemented NCRC on the Testnet.
