The language in question was included in a release announcing the emergency agreement reached between the SEC and Binance.US, which goes by the corporate name BAM Trading, intended to keep customer assets safe while allowing the company to continue business operations.","\u201CThe SEC\u2019s press release also appears to be designed to introduce unwarranted confusion into the marketplace, which could have the effect of harming BAM customers rather than protecting them,\u201D Binance\u2019s lawyers wrote to the court last week. \u201CIt also risks tainting the jury pool with misleading descriptions of the evidence concerning the defendants.\u201D","The filing in question concerned a statement in the release from SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal, who said that the agreement restricting how Binance.US can move funds was necessary.","\u201CGiven that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms\u2019 customers\u2019 assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets,\u201D he said. \u201CFurther, we ensured that U.S. customers will be able to withdraw their assets from the platform while we work to resolve the alleged underlying misconduct and hold Zhao and the Binance entities accountable for their alleged securities law violations.\u201D","The SEC wants Berman Jackson to ultimately freeze assets for Binance.US, Binance and Zhao, as well as bar them from doing business in the U.S. But the June 17 agreement that the SEC issued a release about only concerns a temporary restraining order on Binance.US, which the SEC said was necessary because a 2022 internal report on the trading platform\u2019s assets provided by a third party firm could not determine whether the U.S. affiliate of Binance held the assets it said it did, or if they were actually held overseas with its corporate parent.","Berman Jackson did not fully agree with the agency in that request, instead urging the markets regulator and Binance.US to reach an agreement on how to maintain safety of customer assets while allowing the company to continue \"an ordinary course of business.\"","The SEC also alleges that Binance and Binance.US <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233652\/sec-binance-and-us-affiliate-redirected-billions-in-customer-assets-to-zhaos-funds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">redirected billions in customer funds to investment vehicles controlled by Zhao<\/a>, with most of the money being used to pay Paxos, the issuer of BUSD. The SEC also claims Zhao bought himself a yacht using commingled funds.","In addition to the 2022 audit, the agency outlined details of bank records it obtained, primarily from Silvergate and Signature Banks, which maintained networks for business-to-business transactions by crypto firms, to back up the allegations.","The allegations parallel similar accusations about fraud and misuse of customer funds in civil, criminal and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236507\/latest-ftx-bankruptcy-report-provides-lurid-details-into-alleged-fraud\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bankruptcy<\/a> cases involving FTX, Alameda Research, and Sam Bankman-Fried.","Berman Jackson set a Sept. 21 due date for Binance's pleadings in the civil case.","Â© 2023 The Block.
