New asset classes (bonds, equities, fx stablecoins) could lead to interoperability between asset classes on-chain and scope for further programmability based on deal contract conditions,\u201D they said. \u201CThe plumbing built for retail speculation starts to drive institutional utility.\u201D","BlackRock unveiled plans for its tokenized money market fund earlier this month with financial services firm Securitize, deepening its foray into digital assets after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/learn\/281378\/what-is-blackrocks-ibit-spot-bitcoin-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launching<\/a> a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in January.","According to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) is a liquid fund investing in U.S. Treasury bills, repurchase agreements (short-term borrowing agreements for dealers in government securities) and cash.","Securitize acts as the tokenization platform, and transfer and placement agent. Anchorage, Coinbase, BitGo and Fireblocks are ecosystem partners facilitating custody and settlement of digital assets, and BNY Mellon facilitates interoperability with traditional markets by custodying the fund's assets, the analysts explained.","Beyond their legitimacy argument, Chhugani and Sapra said that while tokenized funds are nothing new \u2014 Franklin Templeton <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/228445\/franklin-templeton-fund-polygon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> a tokenized money-market fund in 2021 \u2014 BlackRock bringing in partners from both traditional and crypto worlds would encourage more traditional institutional customers to adopt on-chain funds, with reduced friction.","\u201CThis would act as the first major test case for institutional holders to experience 24*7 instant settlement benefits of the blockchain with increased transparency and improved capital efficiency, at reduced operating costs,\u201D the analysts said. \u201CFor an institutional holder using liquid funds as margin\/collateral, there are significant benefits to counter-parties with increased transparency and capital efficiency from instant settlement.\u201D","Tokenized funds could also become a new growth category for asset managers, Chhugani and Sapra added \u2014 evolving their participation from simple investment via ETFs to building on-chain products as a commercial revenue and cost-saving opportunity.","The BUIDL token is designed to offer a stable value of $1 per token, paying qualified investors dividends in the form of tokens representing U.S. dollar yield.","\u201CTokenization can be seen as the next evolution of financial markets, similar to the ETF wave of the last 2 decades,\u201D Chhugani and Sapra concluded.","Last week, the Bernstein analysts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/283948\/bernstein-bitcoin-2024-price-target-90000-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> their year-end bitcoin price target to $90,000, expecting a \u201Cmild\u201D halving impact on miners.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
