Depending on the rate of block production, the halving should occur sometime in the next five to six hours (though things like miner luck and variance could shift the window as well).","As this editor wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/61762\/the-bitcoin-halving-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in an explainer piece<\/a> back in mid-April, the actual change taking place is a subtly notable one for the network's forward progress:","\"The roughly quadrennial event is arguably an important one in the progression of the bitcoin network. For all the adjustments and changes to bitcoin's code since its launch \u2013 and the evolution of the ecosystem and industry around it \u2013 the issuance cycle and bitcoin's predetermined supply have never been altered. The halving is, perhaps, emblematic of both bitcoin's philosophical basis as well as its technical progression. It's also a heck of a lot of fun, with past halvings inspiring celebrations and watch-parties for those counting down each block until the halving officially kicks in.\"","On that latter point, the pre-halving celebrations are in full swing \u2013 all against the backdrop of CoinDesk's all-virtual Consensus event \u2013 as the transaction blocks tick by. <a href=\"https:\/\/decrypt.co\/28422\/7-best-ways-to-watch-the-bitcoin-halving-2020-live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Decrypt<\/a> posted a handy list of places to post up and watch the countdown, but there's always the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/explorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ever-expanding list of blocks<\/a>.","But as we've reported here at The Block, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/a-brief-look-at-bitcoins-third-halving-61632\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the halving<\/a> itself will likely prove a turning point in a negative sense as well.

Miners, generally speaking, make money through block subsidies plus whichever fees are appended to the transactions included in their blocks.","As Chun Wang, co-founder and managing partner of F2Pool, told The Block: \"Often, larger farms have better economies of scale and therefore are able to survive reductions in the mining reward or price volatility.\"","And of course, what would <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/63593\/what-actually-happens-during-a-bitcoin-halving-technically-speaking-not-much\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a bitcoin halving<\/a> post be without bringing up the oft-mentioned price impact?","The big question appears to be whether the halving <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/62839\/is-the-bitcoin-halving-priced-in-the-pandemic-complicates-things-says-gsrs-rich-rosenblum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">is priced in<\/a>. Bitcoin topped $10,000 last week before seeing a rapid plunge down to $8,100, only to jump back up.
