Treasury recommended the working group in one of the digital asset policy papers it released last September.&nbsp;<\/span>","Liang emphasized that the working group does not necessarily signal a shift in U.S. policy over a digital dollar, with the Fed still in a lead research role.","\"The Fed has also emphasized that it would only issue a CBDC with the support of the executive branch and Congress, and more broadly the public,\" said Liang.&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A CBDC could be either retail or wholesale, Liang said. A wholesale CBDC would be accessible to financial institutions that are already eligible for central bank accounts. A retail CBDC would be a complement to cash, and not replace it. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CFull consideration of these issues for a possible CBDC \u2013 wholesale, retail, or both \u2013 will take some time to complete, but the Working Group plans to provide interim public updates,\u201D Liang said.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Fed has said it would only issue a CBDC if it had support from the executive branch, Congress and the public, though several Fed leaders have made public remarks indicating that a push for a digital dollar is not imminent. One of the Fed's most-engaged leaders on the digital dollar issue, Lael Brainard, is now the National Economic Council director, a top White House advisory position to President Joe Biden. <\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
