The consensus layer upgrade will be named Deneb \u2014 thus giving the combined upgrade its name, Cancun-Deneb.","The most significant change anticipated in Ethereum's Cancun-Deneb upgrade later this year will be Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, also known as \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189829\/ethereum-core-developers-signal-support-for-proto-danksharding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proto-danksharding.<\/a>\" EIP-4844 seeks to augment Ethereum's scalability beyond the current capabilities of Layer 2 solutions.","EIP-4844 aims to bring temporary storage and retrieval of off-chain data by Ethereum nodes to address the data and storage demands of blockchain applications. If this is successfully activated, EIP-4844 is expected to lower the cost of transactions on Layer 2 rollup solutions, including Optimism and Arbitrum, compared to their current rates.","During the call, developers announced that a fifth multi-client devnet to test EIP 4844 is set to be launched in the following week, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.galaxy.com\/research\/insights\/ethereum-all-core-developers-consensus-call-107\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> by Christine Kim, the vice president of research at Galaxy Digital, who attended the developers' meeting. Notably, EIP-4844 has already been tested on four other devnets.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/ethereum\/top-20-gas-consuming-smart-contracts-30d\/embed\" title=\"Top 20 Gas Consuming Smart Contracts (30D)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
