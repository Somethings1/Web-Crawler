She will report to Brian Shroder, president and CEO of Binance.US, who said in today's statement that Lee will help the company prepare for an eventual initial public offering (IPO).","\"Her experience at Paypal, a public Fortune 500 company, in particular, will be invaluable as we chart our path to an IPO in the coming years,\" Shroder said.","Lee said she looks forward to building a finance department at Binance.US \"that lays a strong foundation for continued growth and our path to a future IPO.\"","When asked for more detail on when Binance.US plans to go public, a spokesperson said: \"in the next 2-3 years.\" The company \u2014 which first revealed IPO plans last year \u2014 has yet to decide which exchange it will list its shares on, according to the spokesperson.
