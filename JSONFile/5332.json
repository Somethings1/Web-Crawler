Certain electronic consumer transactions are,\u201D CFPB Director Rohit Chopra told The Block after an hours-long congressional hearing.","Digital asset policy came up frequently during a regular appearance by Chopra before the House Financial Services Committee, including further prodding around whether a recently published <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185712\/cfpb-romance-scams-and-pig-butchering-play-key-role-in-growing-crypto-complaints\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">consumer alert bulletin<\/a> related to crypto meant the bureau would step up enforcement on crypto companies.&nbsp;","\u201CDo you anticipate expanding your enforcement in this area?\u201D asked Rep.
