This aggregator service&nbsp;has been launched as an opt-in beta feature on Uniswap Labs' front-end platform on Ethereum.","UniswapX aims to be an open network of third-party entities called \"fillers\" who compete to fill swaps using onchain liquidity like decentralized exchange pools across all of Uniswap versions or their own private inventory, according to Hayden Adams.","\"Swappers can use the <span class=\"il\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Uniswap<\/span> interface without worrying whether they\u2019re getting the best price and transactions will always be transparently recorded and settled onchain,\" Adams explained. \"All orders are backstopped by the <span class=\"il\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Uniswap<\/span> smart order router, which forces fillers to compete with <span class=\"il\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Uniswap<\/span> v1, v2, v3 and, once it launches, v4.\"","Uniswap is the largest decentralized exchange protocol by daily trade volume. In the last 24 hours alone, the decentralized exchange protocol handled approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/exchanges\/uniswap-v3-ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$260 million<\/a>&nbsp;on its version 3 platform on the Ethereum mainnet.","One of the main features of UniswapX will be gas-free execution, allowing swappers to authorize off-chain orders while fillers pay the gas fees on their behalf.&nbsp;","\u201CWith UniswapX, swappers sign a unique off-chain order, which is then submitted on-chain by fillers who pay gas on swappers\u2019 behalf,\u201D said Adams. \u201CSince swappers don\u2019t have to pay gas, they don\u2019t require a chain\u2019s native network token (like ETH, MATIC) to trade.\u201D","The protocol will also have the ability to safeguard against <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227110\/mev-trading-bot-memecoins-subway\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">maximal extractable value<\/a> (MEV) \u2014 thereby resulting in improved swap prices and discouraging malicious value extraction from network participants like sandwiching, Adams added. For this purpose, the so-called fillers will be incentivized to use private transaction relays when routing orders to onchain liquidity venues.","UniswapX also includes a protocol fee switch that can be activated later if approved via a vote by Uniswap's governance body.","Adams emphasized that UniswapX will be immutable and that Uniswap Labs cannot modify or pause its contract. Users will maintain self-custody of their funds throughout the swaps.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
