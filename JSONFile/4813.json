The move aims to bridge the gap between fiat and crypto and improve the speed and convenience of transactions by avoiding the need to go through centralized exchanges.","Utopia said the U.S. banking system has failed to support crypto organizations, and its solution addresses this shortfall head-on. Businesses that make, raise or send money in crypto can pay service providers, office rent or \u201Cliterally anyone who has a U.S. bank account\u201D via USDC, the firm said.","Venture capital funds sending USDC wires to portfolio companies and crypto projects off-ramping their on-chain revenue were further examples of potential use cases, Utopia added.","\u201CUSDC for B2B payments == goodness!,\u201D CEO of USDC issuer Circle Jeremy Allaire <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jerallaire\/status\/1682149572510904320?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>, responding to the news.&nbsp;","\u201CWill need to try this out.

The USDC transfers are exclusive to the Ethereum blockchain with no limits and are compliant with ACH (automated clearing house) transfers \u2014 received in less than three business days, the firm said.","While the service is available to most countries worldwide, companies in Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Belarus and Russia are not supported, Utopia added.","Utopia\u2019s roadmap includes providing offramping for any token, not just USDC, expanding to other blockchain networks and introducing onramps to get fiat into crypto.","Beyond crypto payments, Utopia Labs also offers treasury management for Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) users, enabling token swaps with liquidity across more than 100 decentralized exchanges through its integration with 0x Protocol.","Utopia Labs raised <a href=\"https:\/\/tokeninsight.com\/en\/news\/dao-payroll-system-utopia-closed-23-million-series-a-funding-round-led-by-paradigm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$23 million<\/a> in a 2022 Series A funding round led by Paradigm, with participation from Circle Ventures and Coinbase Ventures.","Paradigm caused <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232247\/crypto-vc-paradigm-ai\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">confusion<\/a> in May when the crypto-focussed VC firm removed references to crypto investment from its website in favor of a pivot to artificial intelligence.
