Bob Menendez, a senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, replied simply, \u201CYes.\u201D Asked if he planned to question SEC Chair Gary Gensler about that, Menendez replied, \u201CI am.\u201D &nbsp;","On the other side of the Capitol, Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the soon-to-be number-three Republican in the House of Representatives, has echoed criticism from members of the decentralized finance community over Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s lobbying of the SEC for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186908\/ftx-asked-about-but-did-not-receive-special-exemption-from-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">no-action letter request<\/a> that was not granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;","\u201CWhat involvement did he have with the SEC and others? I think we\u2019ve got a lot of questions,\u201D Emmer told The Block.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Gensler has become a lightning rod for criticism from digital asset advocates, making him an easy target for them as accusations of massive malfeasance against FTX build. Industry lawyers have been quick to blame the SEC.&nbsp;","\u201CI simply don\u2019t think you would have ended up with such a disaster if uncertainty and lack of engagement had not driven so much market activity outside of the U.S. in the first place,\u201D said Alex Lindgren, partner at LLOY Law, a law firm focused around a securities practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;","&nbsp;\u201CI want to know why our \u2018cop on the beat\u2019 was blind to this,\u201D<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jchervinsky\/status\/1592521220213583873?s=20&amp;t=TNUIoc5rNE-978J2aRwLPg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> wrote<\/a> Jake Chervinsky, an attorney for crypto trade group the Blockchain Association.&nbsp; \u202F&nbsp;","Coy Garrison, an attorney with Steptoe and Johnson said the case called into question the agency\u2019s priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;","\u201CObviously the SEC\u2019s not to blame for what happened but there\u2019s some valid questions being raised about where the SEC has been allocating its resources,\u201D said Garrison, formerly a counsel to pro-crypto SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;","But some of Gensler\u2019s loudest critics in Congress held their fire in this instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;","\u201CI\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s an SEC issue here. Let\u2019s remember, most of the problems originated with an offshore exchange and I\u2019m not sure the SEC jurisdiction reaches there,\u201D said Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, the retiring top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. \u201CThere\u2019s a lot of facts and circumstances that I would need to know before I could answer that question\u201D of whether the SEC should have been more aggressive towards FTX.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Noting the 130 legal entities tied to FTX in various countries, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., also hesitated to blame the SEC for not taking action.&nbsp;&nbsp;","\u201CKnowing that it takes anywhere from one to three years to develop an enforcement action or an action for fraud against a company as complicated as FTX, it would have been really challenging to do it in the timeframe that FTX has been up and running,\u201D she said.\u202F&nbsp;&nbsp;","Gensler recently defended his agency\u2019s priorities when asked why the agency pursued enforcement actions against celebrities like Kim Kardashian but not FTX.&nbsp;&nbsp;","\u201CBuilding the evidence, building the facts, often takes time,\u201D Gensler <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185310\/gensler-pressed-on-ftx-failure-warns-investors-to-be-careful-beware\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told CNBC<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;","The perception of the SEC\u2019s powers versus the reality of its limits explains part of why the agency has not taken legal action against yet, according to some of the agency\u2019s defenders. Gensler himself has consistently pushed for more companies to come forward and register their tokens as securities offerings, or themselves as securities exchanges, which may explain part of why he and senior SEC staff met with FTX earlier this year. &nbsp;","\u201CEverybody wants to turn to the SEC and say it's their fault,\u201D said Lisa Braganca, a former branch chief at the enforcement division of the SEC\u2019s Chicago office. \u201CAnd I would say that the SEC has been saying for a long time that they think these digital coins are securities. That's the first thing. And so I think if they had their druthers, they would have had FTX housed in the U.S. and operating under the rules of a regular security exchange.\u201D\u202F&nbsp;","Ty Gellasch, a one-time counsel to former SEC Commissioner Kara Stein, now president and CEO of the Healthy Markets Association, argued that the industry\u2019s lack of cooperation with inquiries from the regulator, and political complications, slow down the SEC\u2019s work. &nbsp;","\u201CThe SEC has the authority to regulate the securities business, but they and their allies in Congress have argued that these aren\u2019t securities,\u201D Gellasch said. \u201CThat puts regulators in a very high-stakes game of chicken.\u201D&nbsp;&nbsp;","Still, not everyone was convinced the SEC has done enough in the FTX case. &nbsp;","\u201CThe average SEC investigation takes about two years, but that is under ordinary conditions where customer funds are safe and the possible defendant is not a flight risk. When customer funds are at risk, the calculus changes entirely,\u201D said Phil Moustakis, former senior counsel in the SEC\u2019s enforcement division and current attorney at Seward &amp; Kissel. \u201CIn fact, the SEC was already investigating intermediaries in the crypto market, so with FTX they should have had a head start.\u201D&nbsp;","The point could be moot. The Justice Department is investigating, and FTX\u2019s lawyers told a federal bankruptcy judge on Tuesday that they are cooperating with federal law enforcement as well as regulators. That could lead to other enforcement cases, noted John Reed Stark, founding head of the SEC\u2019s office of internet enforcement. &nbsp;","\u201CMy guess is that search warrants, grand jury subpoenas and arrests are all ongoing and imminent,\u201D Stark, now a law professor at Duke University, said via online message.&nbsp;","Regulators including the SEC and FINRA are likely to perform examinations of any firm with contact to the fallout of FTX\u2019s collapse, Stark continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;","He also predicted that cooperation from FTX insiders could lead to more investigations by law enforcement and the SEC, since scrutiny at one firm could lead to tip-offs on dealings by others as those close to the situation grow more willing to talk. Stark noted, \u201Cgregarious informants and immunity-seeking witnesses undoubtedly abound.\u201D&nbsp;&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
