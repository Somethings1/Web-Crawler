Its core group of users is composed of \u201Ccrypto natives,\u201D though a number of financial institutions have begun piloting closed-circuit versions of open DeFi protocols or running experiments on-chain.","While the sector is still relatively immature, DeFi could be said to be one of the few use cases in crypto that has found product-market fit. Moreover, in a year that saw several centralized crypto lending companies file for bankruptcy protection \u2013 many of which once had multi-billion-dollar valuations and counted tens of thousands of users \u2013 no major DeFi application failed during the months that saw crypto\u2019s total market capitalization decrease from over $2 trillion to under $1 trillion.","These systems, which execute basic financial operations at any time of day using pre-set rules and publicly auditable code, were and remain able to return funds to users, liquidate underwater loans based on pre-established collateral requirements and generate yield.","See also: Crypto and Regulators Are Speaking the Same Language When It Comes to Transparency | Opinion","It is for this reason that many stakeholders across DeFi think the best course for the industry is not to implement know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures standard in traditional finance (aka TradFi), but to work with and educate regulators and institutions on accepting DeFi as it exists.","The task at hand is to demonstrate why those design decisions were made, and what benefits they may bear for users and financial watchmen. Because anyone can publish code to a blockchain and because anyone with sufficient technological knowledge can access that code, some amount of unregulated, unsurveilled and potentially illicit DeFi activity will always be possible.
