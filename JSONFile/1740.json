The company&nbsp;argues that a coordinated shorting of its tokens caused their May 2022 crash, and that Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s failed crypto empire has information and relevant documents.","On Monday, Judge John Dorsey of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware gave special leave for the algorithmic stablecoin company to compel the currently defunct trading platform to provide documents and information relevant to Terraform\u2019s argument.","Lawyers for FTX, who also represent FTX US, also agreed to the order, which was redrafted after a compromise between them and Terraform\u2019s lawyers, since companies and individuals who enter bankruptcy are typically shielded from additional legal action until they exit bankruptcy. FTX will provide the records requested, as long as they\u2019re limited to Terraform\u2019s defense against the SEC\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2023-32\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">case<\/a>.","Those include \u201Crecords about wallets, accounts, and assets used to transact\u201D on FTX\u2019s different trading platforms and large volumes of sales or offers \u201Cof large volumes of cryptocurrencies developed\u201D by Terraform Labs. Included in that request is information around wallets and trading accounts by Jump Trading through FTX to trade UST or Luna from May 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022, and any other account and wallet information used by Terra\/Luna short sellers during that same time period.","In its case against the stablecoin issuer, the SEC has argued that their clients entered into an agreement with Jump Trading to restore UST\u2019s value, which the stablecoin issuer denies. The subpoena intends to produce evidence to disprove that part of the SEC\u2019s case against Terraform and its founder Do Kwon, who is currently held in a Montenegrin prison on unrelated charges.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
