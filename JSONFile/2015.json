University ambassadors and community managers will also be tasked with spearheading activities to boost consumer adoption of Arbitrum, according to the statement.","Japan is one of the more crypto-friendly jurisdictions, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida saying web3 has the potential to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241258\/web3-japan-fumio-kishida\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">transform the internet<\/a> and contribute to social change at the WebX conference in July.","In June, Japan's National Tax Agency <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236226\/japanese-tax-code-exempts-crypto-issuers-from-paying-unrealized-tax-gains\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">exempted<\/a> crypto issuers from paying capital gains taxes of around 35% on unrealized gains, aimed at bolstering its crypto industry. However, the Japan Blockchain Association wants the country's government to further revise its crypto tax system, requesting taxes on profits from crypto transactions be canceled on the basis that it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241990\/japan-blockchain-association-crypto-tax-revision\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hindering the growth of web3 businesses in Japan<\/a>.","\"We have received a lot of interest from both Japanese enterprises and individual developers about Arbitrum technology,\" Rong told The Block via email. \"We would like to better serve these clients with local resources on the ground. It was thrilling to see the Japanese government release a web3 whitepaper recommending to boost the crypto industry in the county.\"","The Arbitrum Foundation also has plans to increase Arbitrum's presence in Korea and other regions in South East Asia, Rong added.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222205\/arbitrum-airdrop-token-claim-live\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arbitrum's token airdrop took place in March<\/a>, alongside the launch of the Arbitrum Foundation, seeing 1.16 billion tokens made available as a reward for early users of the Layer 2 network and giving them governance powers on the DAO that controls the Arbitrum One and Nova networks.&nbsp;","However, Arbitrum's first governance proposal \u2014 controversially planning to send 750 million ARB tokens, worth around $1 billion at the time, to the Arbitrum Foundation to invest in initiatives \u2014 caused a backlash from its community over an apparent lack of decentralization.","The proposal was set to go ahead without the approval of token holders \u2014 who make up the DAO that theoretically governs Arbitrum \u2014 who had voted overwhelmingly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/224444\/arbitrum-sells-tokens-aip1?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">against<\/a> the move. Bowing to the pressure, the proposal was broken up and voted on again.","Earlier this week, the Arbitrum Foundation announced that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252727\/arbitrum-dao-unclaimed-airdrop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">69 million ($57 million) in unclaimed airdropped ARB tokens<\/a> were transferred to the Arbitrum DAO treasury, contrasting with a recent decision by Ethereum Layer 2 rival Optimism to directly distribute unclaimed funds from its initial airdrop to eligible users.","Arbitrum dominates the Ethereum Layer 2 scaling market in terms of total value locked (funds deposited), with $5.9 billion (55%) of TVL across Layer 2 chains, according to L2BEAT. Optimism follows with $2.7 billion, then Coinbase's Base at $552 million.","However, Base leads the optimistic rollup scaling solutions in terms of daily new unique addresses and average daily transaction count, according to The Block's data dashboard.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/scaling-solutions\/optimistic-rollups\/daily-new-unique-addresses-for-optimistic-rollups\/embed\" title=\"Daily New Unique Addresses for Optimistic Rollups\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with additional comments from Arbitrum Foundation Head of Ecosystem Development Nina Rong.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["ARBITRUM","ETHEREUM"]}
