So, a sell-off of $300 million worth of bitcoin should and will result in a negative price movement.\"","However, the analyst expects any dip to be short-lived and followed by a price correction.","While bitcoin historically presents an inverse correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index, it has failed to appreciate in the wake of DXY's recent decline of around 2.3%.&nbsp;","\"The BTC-DXY relationship will be hard to shake for long, though,\" said Noelle Acheson, author of Crypto is Macro Now <a href=\"https:\/\/noelleacheson.substack.com\/p\/monday-july-17-2023\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">newsletter<\/a>. \"It's not just that the U.S. dollar is the denominator in the most-quoted pair for the crypto asset, and when the denominator goes down in value, the ratio goes up, all else being equal, it's also that a weaker dollar boosts global liquidity by giving U.S. dollar debt holders around the world more room to breathe.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
