One good thing is that proofs of hacks are available on-chain forever,\" 1inch said in its report.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Launched in 2017, Profanity is a tool that allows Ethereum users to generate \u201Cvanity addresses,\u201D a type of custom wallets that contain identifiable names or numbers within them.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to 1inch, the private keys to these Profanity-based addresses could be calculated using brute force attacks.

If you have the private key for an address, you can sign a transaction proving you own the funds at that address. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Most addresses are truly randomly-generated containing a string of random characters. Vanity addresses, on the other hand, have to be generated using a special method. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In its report, 1inch explained that the Profanity tool created millions of addresses per second and searched for the desired letters or digits that were requested by users as custom wallet addresses.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To come to its conclusion, 1inch claimed that it was able to recompute some of the private keys of Profanity-generated vanity addresses with GPU chips.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We have proof of concept of recovering a private key from a public key.
