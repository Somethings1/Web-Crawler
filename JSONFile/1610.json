For the new ILO on Avalanche, the right to such a payout has been tokenised, and would be delivered as a digital asset.","Investors run the risk, of course, that claims prove unsuccessful \u2013 just as investors in ICOs or equity crowdfunding offerings take their chances that the issuers of those tokens or shares may fail.","In a press release, Ava Labs highlighted the example of LexShares, a leading litigation fund, which has generated a median annualised return after fees and expenses of 52% since it began investing in 2014. Those returns, however, come from having invested in over 100 cases.","\u201CThis is a huge new market class that is being now made fully liquid and made available to retail investors,\u201D Kevin Sekniqi, co-founder and chief operating officer of Ava Labs, told the Block.","Asked whether individual investors could achieve the right level of diversification with limited funds, Sekniqi said \u201Cthe first tokenised litigation financing instruments are going to be highly advantageous to the holders.\"","\u201CThere are no sure-fire wins, they\u2019re just more curated because there are fewer of them,\u201D he added.","Litigation financing, which Ava Labs reckons is worth $10 billion globally, has already been opened to retail investors by crowdfunding platforms. UK-based AxiaFunder is one such example.","What, then, can blockchain technology \u2013 or more specifically, the Avalanche blockchain \u2013 bring to the asset class?","\u201CThe reason from a practical perspective why I think blockchain-based markets enable and bring really a disruptive force to litigation finance is the power it gives to making a market both liquid and truly transferrable around the world,\u201D said Kyle Roche of Roche Cyrulnik Freedman LLP.","Roche added that blockchain gives lawyers \u201Ca mechanism to pay out and distribute\u201D funds for successful cases."],"hashtag":["AVALANCHE"]}
