Thiel's comments to The Block followed a report by Bloomberg, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/193134\/bitcoin-miner-marathon-explores-compute-north-bid-bloomberg?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">which said<\/a> Marathon was mulling a bid on Compute North and had hired outside experts to advise on its exposure to the bankrupt hosting provider.&nbsp;","Even as companies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189405\/dcgs-foundry-digital-buying-compute-north-facilities-amid-possible-genesis-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">like DCG's Foundry<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/187900\/bankrupt-compute-north-selling-1-55-million-in-assets-to-crusoe\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mining company Crusoe<\/a> buy up some of Compute North's assets, Marathon appears unlikely to follow suit.","\"We're not interested in buying any of their sites and those have all been sold at this point, I think,\" Thiel said. \"And other than that, I don't think there are a whole lot of assets that are worth looking at from our side.\"","That's not to say that the company would never consider buying up any distressed assets, according to Thiel. \"If the right opportunities arise we're obviously going to look at things,\" he said.","Marathon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175291\/bitcoin-miner-marathons-investments-in-bankrupt-compute-north-totaled-31-3-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">invested $31.3 million into Compute North<\/a>. Its exposure to the bankrupt firm also included $50 million in operating deposits, of which $22 million of the remaining are likely fully recoverable as deposits and $8 million have already been written off, the company said this week in its November operational update.","Unlike other bitcoin miners, Marathon runs a more asset-light model, meaning that it doesn't own its own infrastructure, instead contracting with hosting providers.

This increased curtailment was caused by spot market pricing of energy driven by weather combined with lower bitcoin prices,\" said Thiel in a statement.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
