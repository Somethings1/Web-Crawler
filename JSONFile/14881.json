Though USDT has the largest market capitalization among all stablecoins, USDC has its advantages and differences among its peers.","USDC is basically a tokenized version of the U.S. dollar (USD). It is fully redeemable, meaning you can trade it for the same amount of cash you deposited to create your account. USDC provides customers with a fast and cost-effective way to transfer value quickly anywhere in the world. Unlike some stablecoins linked to the price of a single asset or basket of assets, USDC's value is tied directly to the U.S. dollar. USDC reserves are held in segregated accounts in the United States with regulated U.S. financial institutions in the form of cash and short-duration U.S. Treasuries.","The USDC protocol was made to provide better access to cryptocurrencies to the general public. The goal behind USDC is to help the cryptocurrency sector become more user-friendly.","USDC was also developed in order to be used by businesses and individuals alike.
