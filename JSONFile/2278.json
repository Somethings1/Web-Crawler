SANGO has a total supply of 21 billion tokens.","CAR became the first African country to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/143738\/central-african-republic-adds-bitcoin-as-legal-currency-afp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">adopt bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender<\/a> in April.

Per the document, Sango will work best as a digital monetary system if it is deployed as a bitcoin sidechain rather than settling transactions directly on the bitcoin network.","The Sango Layer 2 will reportedly have a built-in bitcoin interoperability via a two-way peg mechanism. In this arrangement, a set of validators called the Institutional Quorum will have custody of CAR\u2019s bitcoin treasury.","Users who deposit BTC into the Sango sidechain will mint Sango bitcoin (s-BTC), a wrapped version of bitcoin. Users can trade s-BTC for SANGO, which is the currency used for transactions in the country\u2019s crypto platform.","The Sango platform will have a built-in automated market maker to handle conversions between s-BTC and SANGO. Users who wish to withdraw their BTC will trade SANGO back to s-BTC, which will then be burned to return the bitcoin deposit.","The Sango sidechain will have 21 node validators responsible for facilitating transactions on the network. These validators will be controlled by elected officials, including the presidency, federal ministers and members of the national assembly.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
