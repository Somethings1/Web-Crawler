The BlockFi Interest Accounts have faced scrutiny from securities regulators in New Jersey, Texas, Kentucky, Alabama and Vermont over the offering. Several of these states planned or issued cease-and-desist orders as part of their investigations throughout 2021.","The company has been under investigation since at least November over the lending product, which offers yields as high as 9.5%.","When asked about the report of the settlement, a BlockFi spokesperson would only say, \"We have been in productive ongoing dialogue with regulators at the federal and state level.
