That exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in November and its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is facing criminal and civil charges. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to the SEC, Singh was \u201Can active participant\u201D in a plan to deceive FTX\u2019s investors. Singh went so far as to withdraw about $6 million from FTX for his personal use including a \u201Cmulti-million dollar house and donations to charitable causes.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Singh consented to a \u201Cbifurcated settlement\u201D regarding the SEC charges, which awaits a court\u2019s approval. Earlier on Tuesday Singh reportedly pleaded guilty to separate criminal charges brought by federal prosecutors.&nbsp;<\/span>","The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also charged Singh with \u201Cfraud by misappropriation and aiding and abetting fraud.\u201D Singh did not contest the agency\u2019s claims and \u201Cagreed to the entry of a proposed consent order of judgment as to his liability on the charges in the complaint,\u201D per a statement from the commodities regulator.","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC said Singh also created software code that allowed FTX customer funds to go to Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund founded by Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. That was done \u201Cdespite false assurances by Bankman-Fried to investors that FTX was a safe crypto asset trading platform with sophisticated risk mitigation measures to protect customer assets and that Alameda was just another customer with no special privileges,\u201D a statement from the SEC said. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Singh knew or should have known that those statements were misleading, the agency said. &nbsp;<\/span>","At one point in 2021, Bankman-Fried noticed that FTX was $50 million short of his $1 billion annual revenue goal and so told Singh to \u201Ctransfer funds from another entity that he controlled, and to falsely characterize the $50 million as revenue that FTX earned throughout 2021,\u201D the SEC said in its complaint. \u201CSingh then backdated a series of fraudulent transfers, and later lied to auditors about the transfers and created false documentation to support those lies,\u201D the SEC claims.","Singh also became concerned about Alameda\u2019s liability to FTX, among other factors that would jeopardize both firms\u2019 financial stability. Singh opposed some of the exchanges \u201Cambitious\u201D projects that didn\u2019t have enough resources, money spent extravagantly on marketing and the firm\u2019s acquisitions, the SEC said.","\u201CNevertheless, despite these concerns, Singh continued to work at FTX and to support Bankman-Fried,\u201D the SEC's filing reads.&nbsp;","Alameda and FTX shared office space, personnel, technology, intellectual property and other resources, including some personnel and resources that Singh supervised, the CFTC claimed. This was all despite assurances that Alameda and FTX were separate entities.","When FTX began to collapse, Ellison held a meeting with Alameda staff and said she, Bankman-Fried and others had decided to use FTX customer assets to pay Alameda\u2019s debts and that Singh and Wang knew about that. Most Alameda employees resigned soon after the meeting, according to the CFTC\u2019s complaint.","Singh's cooperation is another major coup for regulators and prosecutors in their ongoing cases against Bankman-Fried. Ellison and Wang have already pleaded guilty or settled in their respect criminal and civil cases.&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe allege that this was fraud, pure and simple: while on the one hand FTX touted its supposed effective risk mitigation measures to investors, on the other Mr. Singh and his co-defendants were stealing customer funds using software code Mr. Singh helped create,\u201D said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, in a statement released with news of the complaint.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York also announced charges against Singh in parallel actions. Singh pleaded guilty to six criminal charges brought by SDNY prosecutors in a court hearing on Tuesday, according to Reuters.<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with additional information on CFTC and SEC charges and complaint details.&nbsp;<\/em>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
