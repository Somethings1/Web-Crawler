Its mainnet went live last October and currently offers an infrastructure for spot order-book trading. \"Right now, we have six spot markets and one dApp, i.e. WooFi DEX,\" Arora said. The next plan is to support perpetual futures and multiple dApps by the end of April, he said, adding that multichain support will also follow next.","\"Users can expect to see multichain perps across the blue-chip Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) and non-EVM chains,\" Arora said. \"Users can also expect native deposits and withdrawals from blue chip chains.\" He declined to comment on specific blockchains that will be supported.","The current total value locked or TVL of Orderly Network <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/orderly-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stands at<\/a> $6.2 million, according to DefiLlama. Arora expects the TVL to \"drastically increase\" with the launch of perps, new dApps and multichain support in the coming months.","As for Orderly's native token, it's expected to launch in the second half of the year, according to Arora. To keep up with its growth plans, Orderly looks to increase the team size of its full-time employees from the current 32 people by hiring across functions, Arora said.","Orderly is CoinDCX Ventures' fifteenth investment. The venture unit was launched in May 2022 with a $12 million fund. It has thus far invested in 15 startups, including Stader Labs, Space &amp; Time and Unstoppable Domains."],"hashtag":["DECENTRALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE","DEXS","STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS"]}
