Every time a creator wants to monetize their IP they need to negotiate a new deal often getting lawyers and accountants involved each time, Zhang said.","\"It's an extremely tedious process,\" Zhang said.","Spaceport aims to use blockchain technology to make this more efficient and cost effective for creators. Its first application Spaceport Core will enable creators to upload their works, convert the assets to be web3-compatible and then put that IP catalogue in front of brands to secure licensing deals and get contracts signed with royalties going back to the creator via the application, Zhang said.&nbsp;","\"You can think of it as like a multi-stack solution solving the entire licensing process,\" Zhang said.","Spaceport has already brought on board several notable partners, which it will reveal in the coming months, Zhang said. The protocol leverages a series of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible smart contracts and will launch on Ethereum first, but Zhang is also exploring EVM compatible chains such as Polygon.","The round closed in the spring following the collapse of Terra-Luna, Zhang said.","\u201CSpaceport unblocks a key challenge for creators to adopt Web3 by aligning value creation with their IP. Their licensing infrastructure is accessible, easy to use and drives accretive revenues,\u201D said Paul Hsu, founder and CEO of Decasonic, in a statement. \u201CI see large potential today for smart contracts to improve the licensing process and contracts.\u201D","The funds from the raise will be used to hire talent and for product development, according to the announcement.","\"This has been a decade's old problem that they've been waiting for someone to come around and solve,\" Zhang said. \"And so the feedback has been incredible even without our digital presence fully up and running.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
