Alameda has defaulted on the loan as well.","BlockFi filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey on Monday after weeks of speculation about the company\u2019s solvency after it paused withdrawals earlier in November. The lender had been relying on a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX, which itself filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month after doubts emerged about its own solvency following a CoinDesk report revealing Alameda held a large amount of FTX\u2019s exchange token, FTT.","In its first-day filing, BlockFi indicated that it had somewhere between $1 billion and $10 billion in total assets, as well as between $1 billion and $10 billion in liabilities. The lender has north of 100,000 creditors, and about $257 million in cash on hand, some of which it generated by liquidating crypto holdings.","BlockFi does hope to let customers holding their own assets in the BlockFi Wallet product to withdraw their funds, said Sussberg, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis.","\u201CWe intend, Your Honor, as we noted in the pleadings, to quickly file a motion to allow customers to withdraw from their personal wallet to the extent they so wish, because we do not believe that is property of the estate,\u201D he said.","This plan is subject to the formation of a creditor\u2019s committee, he said.","Sussberg told Judge Michael Kaplan that he anticipates the process of recovering BlockFi\u2019s funds from FTX will \u201Cplay out over a long period of time.\u201D","Whether those funds will be recoverable is another question entirely.","Sussberg told the judge that FTX has over 1 million creditors, and it suffered a reported hack the day of its bankruptcy filing on Nov. 11 that drained hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto out of FTX-controlled wallets.","BlockFi\u2019s lawyers emphasized that, though both BlockFi and FTX have filed for bankruptcy protection during the market downturn, that\u2019s where the similarities end.","\u201CThis is the antithesis of FTX,\u201D Sussberg said of BlockFi\u2019s liquidity crisis. \u201CThis is a complete 180-degree different story.\u201D","Sussberg referenced current FTX CEO John Jay Ray III\u2019s statement that he had never seen \u201Csuch a complete failure\u201D of FTX\u2019s executive leadership in his career \u2013 which included cleaning up after Enron\u2019s collapse.","BlockFi\u2019s co-founders, Zac Prince and Flori Marquez, Sussberg told the court, were the opposite of Bankman-Fried.","\u201CThese are self-made individuals \u2026 [who] built the company with their own hands,\u201D Sussberg said. \u201CThis company was on a rocket ship.\u201D","Both Prince and Marquez were in attendance during the first hearing."],"entity":[{"type":"Enron","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"drained hundreds of millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kirkland & Ellis","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$355 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$400 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Joshua Sussberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nov. 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Bankruptcy Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$671 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"FTT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John Jay Ray III","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"earlier this month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"District of New Jersey","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zac Prince","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$10 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michael Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alameda","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$257 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Sussberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Flori Marquez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Marquez","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","BlockFi","FTX","FTX Collapse","Bankrupt","Bankruptcy"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De","Cheyenne Ligon"]}
