When it comes to investing in crypto, many people have become extremely wealthy while others have fallen short and lost large amounts of money.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2022 was a rough year for both investors and crypto markets, which has made many people extra cautious. Caution, though, is a valuable approach when investing in unstable markets. Here are a few tips for cautious investors looking to invest in an asset class that\u2019s been under the microscope.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tip #1: Think Long-term, Not Short-Term<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Investing in cryptocurrency can be difficult and takes some practice and guidance to learn the basics. One of the most common mistakes for beginners is excessive get-rich-quick thinking, the misguided opinion that massive profit will be made right off the bat. This approach causes investors to chase crowds, follow media hype, and invest in risky tokens based on a single previous standout performance \u2013 all of which are things you don\u2019t want to be doing.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For those still looking to gain big over a short period of time, it\u2019s going to be very difficult. When investing in cryptocurrency, focusing on long-term returns could reduce the impact of crypto\u2019s inherent volatile but often short-term price changes. Always remember that investing of any type \u2014 whether in traditional or crypto markets \u2014 runs the risk of big losses alongside the potential for big gains. The bigger the return potential, the bigger the risk. Never invest more in an asset than you have, or that you\u2019re willing to lose.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tip #2: Seek Trusted Advice While Still Doing Your Own Due Diligence<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thinking investing is a solo endeavor or not seeking help is another common mistake people make when getting started. In traditional finance, investors often hire a professional manager to handle their investments. Cryptocurrency is fast becoming a ubiquitous asset class with trillions in value, which has in turn driven an entire industry of professional advisors and managed investment platforms \u2014 like ours at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/haruinvest.com\/about-us\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Haru Invest<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> \u2014 for investors to consult with to help make smart, informed decisions.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If you\u2019re brand new to crypto and perhaps hesitant, lean on an investment professional or advisor that you trust and can rely on for investment advice.
