In August it was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury, with the regulator adding it and 44 associated Ethereum and USDC wallets to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.","The Treasury's reasoning was that being hackers had been laundering funds through the mixing service. At the time, a senior Treasury official said that it would not be the last action against Tornado Cash.&nbsp;","An effect of the sanctions may be seen in stablecoin velocity. This is a measure of the daily transaction volume divided by the current supply of stablecoins.&nbsp;","Following the sanctions, stablecoin velocity increased for DAI, USDC and USDT \u2014 all other stablecoins decreased. The Block Research again attributed this mostly to the Tornado Cash sanctions.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
