DeFi lending platforms use supply caps on collateral assets to guard against <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189167\/curve-token-jumps-50-amid-squeeze-on-big-short-position\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">price manipulation attacks<\/a> that can see malicious actors can target tokens with inadequate liquidity profiles to launch sophisticated attacks on DeFi lending pools.","DeFi lenders like Compound and Aave have recently taken steps to limit their exposure to these attack vectors by either <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179688\/compound-suspends-four-tokens-with-low-liquidity-as-lending-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suspending the use<\/a> of some tokens as collateral or significantly reducing their supply caps.","Â© 2023 The Block.
