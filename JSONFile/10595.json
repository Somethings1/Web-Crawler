An investor with 1% exposure to bitcoin in a traditional 60\/40 portfolio would have outperformed a portfolio without bitcoin exposure by 3.16%. The traditional 60\/40 portfolio is a classic investment strategy that involves allocating 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds.&nbsp;","Despite a muting of the bitcoin diversification narrative during 2022's crypto market turmoil, bitcoin exposure this year would have improved risk-adjusted returns in a traditional portfolio due to softening correlations and solid upside, the analysts added.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Outperformance of bitcoin portfolio.
