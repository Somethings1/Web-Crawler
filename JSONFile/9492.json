However, this does not change the fact that the activity itself is not allowed for Danish financial institutions...,\" the regulator said.","It went on to say that European Union's crypto regulation, known as markets in cryptoassets (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227309\/mica-european-union-crypto-regulation-passes\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MiCA<\/a>) regulation, only comes into effect from Dec. 30, 2024, and therefore Saxo Bank's proprietary trading is unregulated for the time being.","\u201CWe have held a very limited portfolio of cryptocurrencies, solely to hedge a very marginal proportion of risk associated with the facilitation of crypto assets,\u201D a Saxo Bank spokesperson told The Block. \u201CThe vast majority of this exposure is mitigated through exchange-traded and cleared products. Therefore, the FSA\u2019s decision will have a very limited impact on our business, and our client will not experience any significant changes.\u201D","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/224565\/openeden-gemini-execs-tokenized-t-bill-vault\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Saxo Bank<\/a> offers crypto trading to clients and also provides them access to crypto exchange-traded products.
