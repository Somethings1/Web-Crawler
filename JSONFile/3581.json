The new round brings Scroll's total funding to date to $83 million.","Scroll was founded in 2021 with the vision of scaling Ethereum to a billion users. As a Layer 2 network, Scroll processes transactions off Ethereum on its own network and then ports the transaction data back to Ethereum \u2014 helping increase transaction speed and reduce costs.","Scroll uses zk-rollup technology for its network, helping achieve scalability. Scroll's zkEVM, or zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine, batches transactions and then generates proof that these transactions are all legitimate. This proof is then broadcast to Ethereum, and the transactions get approved.","Scroll <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/215343\/scrolls-zk-evm-layer-2-goes-live-on-ethereums-goerli-testnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> its zkEVM on the Goerli testnet last week as it moved out of its pre-alpha testnet phase. Traction on the pre-alpha testnet was strong, Scroll co-founder Sandy Peng told The Block in an interview. It reached one million unique addresses and 16 million transactions on pre-alpha, she said. The mainnet is expected to launch in the next three to four months, Peng added.","Scroll is one of several Ethereum scaling networks that use zk-rollups. Others include Polygon, StarkWare and Matter Labs. Peng said Scroll's three design principles or core values \u2014 community-driven, security first and decentralization at every level \u2014 are its competitive edge.","With the fresh capital, Scroll plans to continue building its product, launch its mainnet and expand its ecosystem. To that end, it is also looking to increase its current team size from around 60 to nearly 100 in the near future, Peng said.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
