Some of these include co-founders of Gemini Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Crypto.com Bobby Bao, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea Devin Finzer. The list also includes hundreds more who\u2019ve built Web1 and Web2\u2019s most notable companies like Greg Sands, a first hire at Netscape.","Starting with providing cohort-based accelerator services, over time the goal is to grow the DAO to provide governance, recruiting, liquidity, marketing, advisory or other potential startup support services, said Lund.","As for the future arc of the project -- including the release of a dedicated token -- \u201Cdocumentation will be released in the near term to explain how the DAO will operate, what services it will provide, and the governance and economic models that will support it,\u201D said Lund.","DAOs and protocol partners will contribute and collaborate on this process, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alliancedao\/status\/1481633399592800257\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a>, listing people like social media influencers Jake Paul and Bored Elon.","People outside the initial contributor group will have the chance to participate. \u201CThis will include Web3 founders who go through the accelerator as well as DAO Contributors who will help grow and operate the DAO and\/or provide support to cohort founders,\u201D said Lund. More details on how others can join and contribute are coming shortly, he said.","According to Lund, experience in Web3 or crypto isn\u2019t required to take part. \u201CAnyone who has founded or built a startup or who is interested in building a DAO or supporting founders will fit in,\u201D said Lund."],"hashtag":[]}
