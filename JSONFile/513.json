In prepared remarks provided to press, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said that rule has not been updated since 2009. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CFurther, today\u2019s proposal, in covering all asset classes, would cover all crypto assets \u2014 including those that currently are covered as funds and securities and those that are not funds or securities,\" Gensler said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The proposed rule also would require advisers to segregate their investors\u2019 assets. The current rule requires advisers and qualified custodians to segregate funds and securities, and the new rule would expand that to all assets, Gensler said. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gensler also warned that depending on how crypto platforms operate, investment advisers cannot rely on them as qualified custodians. An SEC official said some investment advisers do rely on crypto platforms as custodians. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The rule would also require advisers to enter into a written agreement with qualified custodians to make sure clients get certain protections.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThese protections are designed, among other things, to ensure client assets are properly segregated and held in accounts designed to protect the assets in the event of a qualified custodian bankruptcy or other insolvency,\u201D the agency said in a fact sheet. &nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce was the lone vote against the proposed rulemaking, citing concerns that the requirements would end up \u201Cshrinking the ranks of qualified custodians.\u201D&nbsp;","\u201CBy insisting on an asset neutral approach to custody we could leave investors in crypto assets&nbsp;<i class=\"ContentPasted0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">more<\/i>&nbsp;vulnerable to theft or fraud, not less,\u201D Peirce said. &nbsp;","During the meeting, Peirce asked SEC staff whether there would be any \u201Cqualified custodians in the crypto space,\u201D if the rule were to go into place today. The SEC staff said yes and said the proposal is aimed at being technology neutral. &nbsp;","Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw supported the rule proposal. &nbsp;","<span class=\"ContentPasted0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhile the Custody Rule today in fact covers many crypto asset securities, I share the concerns in the release that many of those assets are not in practice properly custodied or safeguarded, and events across the crypto markets have shown the spectacular harm and loss that can befall investors when client assets are not adequately safeguarded,\u201D Crenshaw said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","During a media briefing, SEC\u2019s Gensler said crypto exchanges were not following current custodial rules for assets. &nbsp;","Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said the exchange looked forward to engaging with the SEC.&nbsp;","<span class=\"ContentPasted0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCoinbase Custody Trust Co. is a Qualified Custodian today and will be a Qualified Custodian&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"ContentPasted0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tomorrow,\u201D Grewal said. \u201CToday's proposal from does not change this fact.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","A custody rule in general is a good thing in the name of making sure regulated entities safeguard client assets, said Jason Gottlieb, partner and chair of Morrison Cohen's White Collar and Regulatory Enforcement group.&nbsp;","\u201CThe trouble is that we don\u2019t yet know whether this is going to be a followable rule,\u201D Gottlieb said. &nbsp;","If the SEC is saying that the rule will require a registered investment adviser that invests in crypto to have a qualified custodian while also detailing how that custodian can hold crypto \u2014 that is fine, Gottlieb said. &nbsp;","\u201CMy fear is that they will require qualified custodians to hold crypto, but then they will not create a real path for qualified custodians to hold crypto and as a result people won\u2019t be able to find a qualified custodian and as a result they won't\u2019 be able to satisfy the custody rule,\u201D Gottlieb said. &nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"ContentPasted0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With additional reporting from Colin Wilhelm&nbsp;<\/span><\/em>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated throughout with the SEC's vote, Hester Peirce's dissent and industry comment.
