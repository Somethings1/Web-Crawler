In Horsley\u2019s view, traditional portfolio managers and financial advisors remain an untapped market for the nascent crypto asset management industry.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe think about serving the financial advisers, serving the long-term investor, a retirement account, and what are the solutions that will really work for them. That's why you've seen us focused on index products that rebalance themselves so that if the space changes, they don't need to be trading.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In terms of the volatility, Hunter sees this as a positive. For Bitwise, volatility means the opportunity for financial advisors to enter the cryptocurrency market by adopting crypto as another asset class in a client or portfolio\u2019s diversification strategy.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe volatility of crypto is a magical gift for a financial advisor. What do I mean by that? If you're an individual who downloads one of the incredible apps that you have today, you see this jagged price chart, this twenty-four-hour price chart. Right. It's very scary, prone to emotional trading. And that's the scary version of volatility. If you're a financial advisor constructing a portfolio that you want to have certain low correlations, you want to have a certain Sharpe ratio, you want to balance across different asset classes. Well, in that case, crypto volatility is actually very useful.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Looking back to Bitwise's latest round, the startup managed to attract notable backers. Indeed, some of the investors involved in raising the Series B round were industry heavy-hitters.<\/span>","As Horsley put it:","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C[The Series B Funding was] collected by Elad Gil, one of the most accomplished technology investors, Electric Capital, one of the leading crypto venture capital firms and some renowned Wall Street investors; Dan Loeb's Third Point, Daniel Ochs Willoughby, Louis Bacon\u2019s Moore Strategic Ventures, Henry Kravis, Stanley Druckenmiller and [Bridgewater CEO] Dave McCormick.\u201D<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
