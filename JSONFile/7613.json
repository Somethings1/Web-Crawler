The first is an arbitrage system that will try to ensure that the USN stablecoin trades around one dollar worth of NEAR tokens. The second is a \u201Creserve fund\u201D made of NEAR and USDT tokens owned by the DAO treasury. How much will be spent on this fund is still undecided.&nbsp;<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: The article was updated with the latest comments from Decentral DAO.<\/em><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nFor more breaking stories like this, make sure to follow The Block on <\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a class=\"c-link\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a><\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/i>","Â© 2023 The Block.
