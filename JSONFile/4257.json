The company released its first ecosystem project, xSpend, which allows users to pay utility bills and top up their mobile phone using gaming tokens and stablecoins, in January.","Estrada told The Block that the most popular token people are using on xSpend is Axie Infinity's Smooth Love Potion (SLP), which players can win through in-game battles.&nbsp;","xSpend is currently available in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that utility companies there are accepting crypto payments just yet. Instead, the app acts as a \u201Ccrypto-to-fiat off-ramp\u201D and pays merchants in fiat through partners in the different countries.","\u201CThe way we do it is they basically initiate the transaction on chain and send us the [for example] SLP. But across the markets that we operate in we actually have a fiat liquidity pool that's based in that country. We use that to settle with the merchant network,\u201D Estrada told The Block.","Beyond retail, XLD Finance said it is also working on products for protocols and exchanges, and this month will also launch OmniX, a streamlined system for guilds and projects to pay staff and contributors.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
