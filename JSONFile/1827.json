In March, ahead of the debut, it reported an estimated $1.8 billion in total revenue. It hit the mark, according to today's results.","It also hit $335 billion in total volume \u2014 a metric also projected in the estimated report. That's a more than 275%<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/strong>jump from $89 billion last quarter. About $120 billion came from retail activity, with the remaining $215 billion coming from institutions. The growth can be partially credited to a mass of new participants in the crypto economy, according to Coinbase.","As many assets hit all-time highs and displayed high levels of volatility, venues saw an influx of participants. Coinbase saw a jump from 43 million verified users last quarter to 56 million verified users. Monthly transacting users more than doubled from 2.8 million to 6.1 million. This translated to $771.5 million in net income.&nbsp;","Crypto market capitalization reached $2 trillion after sitting at $782 million last quarter, and 11.3% of that market cap, or $223 billion, is on Coinbase.","Though the growth of the industry helped Coinbase produce a strong quarter, it also acknowledged that more competition creates more challenges.&nbsp;","The exchange still doesn't support DOGE, the dog meme-themed cryptocurrency whose price has risen dramatically recently thanks to a movement on social media. Coinbase has yet to onboard the token and competitors like Robinhood remain key access points during the rally. But on the earnings call, CEO Brian Armstrong said it plans to list DOGE in the next six to eight weeks.&nbsp;","\"We're putting a lot of work and thought into how to accelerate our asset onboarding, including DOGE,\" said Armstrong.","In the coming months, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/99345\/coinbase-alumni-soups-ranjan-startup-sardine-4-6-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase<\/a> will devote more resources to onboarding assets more quickly, accelerating the legal and cybersecurity checks as well as distributing onboarding resources to teams behind tokens.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["COINBASE"]}
