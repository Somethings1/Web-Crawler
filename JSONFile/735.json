It is not clear which investors bought the shares.","Three people familiar with the matter said the secondary transaction valued OakNorth at $5 billion. They added that Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, had acted as an advisor on the deal.","Late last year, Indiabulls <a href=\"https:\/\/sifted.eu\/articles\/oaknorth-downround\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sold roughly 7.7% of its stake<\/a> in OakNorth in two transactions for approximately $145 million.

It is advised by former chancellor of the exchequer Lord Philip Hammond and Lord Adair Turner, former chairman of the Financial Services Authority.","From an early stage, the company has proven an outlier within the fintech sector by consistently turning a profit. Earlier this year, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.altfi.com\/article\/7727_oaknorth-sees-profits-soar-as-it-continues-to-weather-covid-19-storm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported pre-tax profits<\/a> for 2020 of £77.6 million.","Khosla has often spoken of how OakNorth\u2019s use of artificial intelligence \u2014 a system it also licenses to other lenders including NIBC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation \u2014 gives it an edge underwriting loans. Khosla used to tell conference audiences that OakNorth had never suffered a default, but the Financial Times reported a rash of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/d6645c7f-bb4e-4275-9a7e-9b1fa3a1317b\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">some £97 million in defaults<\/a> in February 2021 (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fintechfutures.com\/2021\/02\/uk-challenger-oaknorth-faces-97m-in-defaults-from-ten-borrowers\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">roughly 2% of the bank\u2019s loan book at the time<\/a>).","Khosla has history with Indiabulls.
