It concluded that both do a \u201Cdecent job\u201D of attempting to assign ownership to their users for user-generated content, but in both cases the companies retain all intellectual property related to the sales of land parcels in their metaverses, merely assigning usage rights to NFT purchasers.","But even if users own the rights to user-generated content, there is no guarantee that the operator of a metaverse will support it within their virtual world. Content moderation policies allow them to ban or remove content regardless of IP rights.","\u201CSimply owning the rights to a custom-made character skin, for example, does not guarantee that Decentraland or Sandbox will allow the skin to be used within the game\u2026 absent a third-party alternative world in which to deploy your user-generated content, its effective use relies upon the consent of the metaverse operator,\u201D they said.","It also took aim at Yuga Lab\u2019s upcoming metaverse project, Otherside, and its land NFTs, Otherdeeds. NFT token holders have commercial rights for other Yuga Labs collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club, however Otherdeeds do not grant these.","\u201CThe Otherside agreement is explicit that purchasing Otherdeed NFTs conveys no intellectual property rights,\u201D noted the report.","Responding to the report, Sandbox COO and co-founder told The Block that, owing to tokens in its ecosystem being on the blockchain, they have the ability to be used on other platforms or sold on marketplaces.&nbsp;","\"We believe we are still delivering the decentralize metaverse approach that differs from the one built by Web2 giants, where users have no control and no ownership whatsoever of their digital content and data,\" he added, also noting that, as per the company's roadmap, the content moderation process itself is set to be decentralized.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["DECENTRALAND","OTHERSIDE","THE SANDBOX","YUGA LABS"]}
