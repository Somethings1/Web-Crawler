The firm had posted <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/oncyber_io\/status\/1480286576781369345\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a teaser<\/a> of the portal product on Twitter on January 10.","Now, Cyber\u2019s founder Rayan Boutaleb tells The Block that it quietly raised $6.7 million in November in a round led by Variant, the \u2018ownership economy\u2019 seed-stage investor that itself <a href=\"https:\/\/variant.fund\/writing\/fund-ii-announcement\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $110 million<\/a> for its second fund in October.","A bevy of big-name NFT collectors also invested \u2014 including Cozomo de\u2019 Medici, artist Joey Colombo, Product Hunt founder Ryan Hoover, Adobe\u2019s chief product officer Scott Belsky, Not Boring founder Packy McCormick, Art Blocks founder Erick Calderon, and the pseudonymous trio of 6529, DeeZe and Gmoney. Three Arrows Capital and TCG Capital Management, the investment firms, also participated.","Boutaleb did not disclose the startup\u2019s valuation. He plans to use the proceeds of the raise predominantly for hiring while remaining \u201Ccompletely product-led.\u201D Cyber\u2019s mission, he adds, is to \u201Callow people to deploy immersive spaces, no matter how big or small.\u201D","The term metaverse has been all the rage among investors over the past six months, with <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2021\/10\/facebook-company-is-now-meta\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta<\/a> in October only adding to the hype.","The concept of the metaverse \u2014 coined in Neal Stephenson\u2019s science fiction novel Snow Crash and popularized by other novels like Ready Player One \u2014 refers to a virtual reality space in which users can interact with each other.","Boutaleb has previously talked of taking <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/119540\/cybers-founder-wants-to-build-the-art-blocks-of-metaverse-architecture\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a bottom-up approach<\/a> to building such a thing.","Launched in February 2021, Cyber began by letting artists construct and sell virtual showrooms, which themselves take the form of NFTs. Collectors can then mint these and later trade them on marketplaces like OpenSea \u2014 or use them to display their art.&nbsp;But there are also free galleries, available to any user with a crypto wallet.&nbsp;","Now that Cyber\u2019s galleries can be connected through its new portal, Boutaleb believes the platform will start to resemble a kind of social media platform.","\u201CThe second stage is to allow users to connect in these spaces together in a more social kind of way,\u201D says Boutaleb. \u201CThey\u2019re going to kind of be creating their own metaverses, their own worlds.\u201D And in Cyber\u2019s worlds, as the startup explained in <a href=\"https:\/\/oncyber.notion.site\/Cyber-raises-6-7m-to-empower-creatives-to-build-their-own-worlds-with-NFTs-436e25f2239b4f5093a3405a97a144c4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a blog post<\/a>, every piece of content including the space itself is an NFT.&nbsp;","In <a href=\"https:\/\/oncyber.notion.site\/Cyber-read-me-9e4051ae49f7415383c8d695aa5d17bb\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">another recent blog post<\/a> about the company\u2019s development, Cyber said that a multiplayer feature \u2014 which looks as though it will involve touring galleries in the form of an avatar \u2014 is \u201Cright around the corner.\u201D","In time, Boutaleb says he would also like to enable Cyber showrooms to be linked to other metaverse platforms, but he doesn\u2019t see that happening soon.","Â© 2023 The Block.
