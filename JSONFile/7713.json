Musk bought the social media platform with the intention of taking it private in a $44 billion <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/143257\/twitter-accepts-elon-musks-44-billion-takeover-offer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">deal<\/a> this week.","Last year, Wood participated in a panel about bitcoin with Twitter founder and Block Head Jack Dorsey and Musk. Since then, Wood said she suspects their relationship has grown.","\u201CI think Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk have gotten much closer since our 'B Word' conference last year,\" she said.","Given this relationship and where it began, Wood said she expects more crypto aspects to crop up on the platform.","\u201CI think we\u2019re going to see a lot more crypto permeating Twitter,\" she said.","For his part, Novogratz said he's skeptical of Musk's ability to decentralize the platform. In his view, the long-term hope is for decentralized social media, and the recent deal has just shifted the point of centralization from Twitter's board to Musk.","Wood took issue with this, pointing out that Musk has frequently delivered on his promises over time, and she's confident he will open-source the platform.","A spot bitcoin product has been notoriously challenging to get through the US's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the securities regulator rejecting every proposal it's been pressed to make a decision on thus far. The SEC has, however, approved futures-based products, likely due to their reliance on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which chairman Gary Gensler has expressed as a more palatable venue for market surveillance.","ARK's offering was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/140268\/sec-shoots-down-ark-21shares-in-latest-spot-bitcoin-etf-rejection\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rejected<\/a> at the start of this month. Yet Wood said ARK will reapply at some point. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/101357\/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Galaxy's proposal<\/a> is still before the SEC.","For the time being, Wood said she's confused by the SEC's logic of approving a futures-based product without a sense of comfort with the underlying. Grayscale, which has an application for a spot ETF with the SEC, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/125817\/grayscale-argues-the-secs-bitcoin-etf-treatment-could-violate-the-apa\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">expressed<\/a> similar sentiments.","Novogratz said he believes an approval could come soon, as Gensler faces mounting pressure from crypto-friendly lawmakers. In Novogratz's view, Democrats will likely lose in the midterms, and Gensler will shift his views on bitcoin \"sooner rather than later,\" as more technology-focused lawmakers take their seats.","\"I do think we\u2019ll have a bitcoin ETF this year, maybe next year,\" he said.","Wood said it's less of a party divide pushing crypto-friendly regulation forward, it's lawmakers who are focused more on technology than financial services.","\u201CThose who are thinking about it from a technology point of view are accepting it,\" she said.","© 2023 The Block.
