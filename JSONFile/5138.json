Existing investors - Digital Currency Group and Pantera Capital - also participated in the round, according to an announcement Monday.","Bitso, which has been operating in Mexico since 2014 and claiming to serve over 750,000 users in the country, now wants to expand into Argentina and Brazil, among other Latin American nations. \u201CThe region is ready for disruption and we want to be the ones to do so by radically advancing financial inclusion for everyone,\u201D said Daniel Vogel, co-founder and CEO of Bitso.","Indeed, 70% of Latin America\u2019s population (or 400 million people) don\u2019t have a bank account, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/mapping-out-the-blockchain-ecosystem-in-latin-america-33683\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block reported<\/span><\/a> in July. Moreover, several countries in the region have been experiencing macroeconomic challenges of their own.","Argentina, for instance, is facing <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">currency crises<\/span>, among other issues. Last month, the country\u2019s central bank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/38183\/argentina-restricts-us-dollar-purchases-as-its-currency-crisis-escalates\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">put restrictions<\/a> on US dollar purchases in an effort to revive its plunging peso.

In Argentina, for instance, the latest weekly bitcoin volumes jumped to nearly $196,000 via peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange LocalBitcoins. While in Brazil, the figure touched around $307,000.&nbsp;","","","","","Bitso\u2019s move comes at a time when other major exchanges, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/39973\/huobi-to-launch-local-exchange-in-argentina\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Huobi<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/15183\/binance-ceo-confirms-an-upcoming-fiat-to-crypto-exchange-in-argentina\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance<\/span><\/a>, have also announced and hinted their plans of launching a platform in Argentina, respectively.","\u201CWe believe that regulatory compliant fiat-to-crypto gateways around the world are an essential element to digital assets becoming a new global money transfer rail,\u201D said Peter Johnson, principal at Jump Capital, on participating in Bitso\u2019s investment round.","In June, Ripple also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190611005269\/en\/Provider-Solutions-Global-Payments-Silicon-Valley-Officially\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/span><\/a> its operations in Brazil to expand its footprint in South America and to help users make cheaper cross-border payments. \u201CBitso is a key infrastructure partner to Ripple, providing critical liquidity for payments in Mexico,\u201D said Asheesh Birla, SVP of product management at Ripple, adding: \u201CThe team has built real products and amassed a huge customer base in Mexico, and we look forward to partnering with them in this next stage of growth into Latin America.\u201D","Bitso also recently <a href=\"https:\/\/blog-en.bitso.com\/bitso-the-first-regulated-platform-in-latam-ae16416951d5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/span><\/a> its operations in Gibraltar after receiving a distributed ledger technology (DLT) license from the island's financial regulator, the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC).","Â© 2023 The Block.
