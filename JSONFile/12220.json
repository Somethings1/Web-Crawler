When they mature they must either be converted into equity, repaid in cash or a combination of both. Senior secured notes are loans that use the issuer\u2019s assets as a form of collateral.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MicroStrategy issued senior secured notes in June 2021, secured by assets that included any bitcoin bought on or after the closing of the offering. Still, it did not include any of MicroStrategy\u2019s existing bitcoin, or any that might be purchased with the proceeds from existing bitcoin or other holdings.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In May, MicroStrategy\u2019s share price hit a 20-month low of $159.67 before recovering to close the month at $246.65, still down from an open of $355.68. During the month, the company\u2019s bitcoin position fell into the red, where it remains.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin prices plunged in May, as the cryptocurrency market, as well as broader financial markets, were in tumult. After an initial crash in crypto prices early in the month, and as the wider macroeconomic environment worsened, prices plunged further amid the Terra blockchain collapse, following the failure of its stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST).&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This contagion dragged bitcoin below $30,000 as it fell to its lowest levels in 18 months, since trading at about $27,000 on December 21, 2020. While many observers declared this to be clear evidence of a crypto bear market, Saylor said he is not convinced.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI don't know if it's a bear market or not, but if it is a bear market, then we had three of them in the last 24 months,\u201D he told The Block. Saylor was alluding to April 2021, when the price rose to $60,000 before falling back to about $31,000 by July 2021, then hitting all-time highs of $69,000 in November 2021.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Saylor said he prefers not to get caught up in near-term prices, adding that people focusing too much on charts are \u201Cplaying with tea leaves.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">His take: \u201CIf you're not planning to hold it for four years, you're not really an investor at all, you're a trader, and my advice for traders is don't trade it, invest in it.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One of the primary reasons bitcoin and crypto prices fell in May was the capitulation of TerraUSD and luna (LUNA), the Terra blockchain\u2019s two main offerings.&nbsp;<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/146444\/terra-luna-and-ust-how-we-got-here\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Terra\u2019s ecosystem came under pressure<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> after its stablecoin, TerraUSD, lost its peg against the dollar on May 7. A shared relationship between TerraUSD and luna then dragged both down, even though TerraUSD had a \u201Cforex reserve\u201D of more than $3 billion in bitcoin that it offloaded in a futile attempt to defend its peg.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TerraUSD had a burn mechanism involving luna so that anyone holding TerraUSD could trade one token for $1 worth of luna tokens in the event of a de-peg \u2014 if TerraUSD were trading at $0.95 for example.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This would make TerraUSD more scarce and was supposed to pull the price back toward $1, also allowing holders to take advantage of the price difference and potentially make an arbitrage profit, incentivizing them to maintain the peg.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, after TerraUSD lost its dollar peg on May 7, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) \u2014 a non-profit managing Terra\u2019s forex reserve \u2014&nbsp; used up most of its reserves to buy UST in an unsuccessful attempt to defend the peg.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite the collapse of TerraUSD and the depletion of its bitcoin reserves, Saylor maintained that bitcoin is a worthwhile reserve asset.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think it all comes down to the amount of leverage. I think it makes a lot of sense to use bitcoin as a reserve asset,\u201D he said, noting that with reasonable leverage, such as owning $1 billion worth of bitcoin and issuing $50 million worth of a stablecoin, there would be significantly less risk involved with using bitcoin as a reserve asset.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The issue with Terra wasn't so much the idea of owning bitcoin, he said, but that they had too much TerraUSD outstanding.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
