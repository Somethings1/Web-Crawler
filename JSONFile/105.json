Hsu shared Wednesday that the review has concluded and the federal bank regulator will communicate determinations and feedback to bank charter applicants.","Hsu's remarks came at the American Fintech Council's Fintech Policy Summit, where he focused heavily on the lack of consolidated regulatory oversight for crypto firms.","In the past, Hsu has also harped on the issue of a lack of coordinated effort across agencies to clarify rules of the road and regulate crypto firms. To that end, he set up a \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/105374\/occ-federal-reserve-fdic-inter-agency-sprint-team-crypto-regulation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto sprint\"<\/a> between the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.","That joint effort has concluded as well, Hsu said Wednesday, and he added that&nbsp;the results will be communicated \"shortly\" in a variety of forms.","\"The content of these communications \u2014 on the chartering decisions, interpretive letters, and the crypto sprint \u2014 will be broadly aligned with the vision for the bank regulatory perimeter laid out here today,\" he said.","These will clarify what Hsu calls the \"regulatory perimeter\" focusing on what regulators consider the most salient questions. Hsu included a few of these questions in his remarks:","Hsu argued that \"fragmented supervision\" obscures the sometimes \"excessive\" risks that firms might take. He pointed to the patchwork oversight in 2008 that allowed AIG to take on large swaths of risks via a subsidiary, which eventually led to the firm's large-scale collapse and much-debated bailout. Hsu pointed to this event as a lesson for crypto regulation, saying to avoid a similar catastrophe and build \"long-term trust\" with the public, crypto firms and especially stablecoin issuers should embrace \"comprehensive, consolidated supervision.\"","Hsu called on federal and state bank regulators to likewise prioritize this development. He then named two firms \u2014 crypto exchange Binance and stablecoin operator Tether \u2014 as examples with unfavorable track records.","\"This would clearly differentiate safe and sound crypto firms from those that are regulated only partially and have a history of control lapses, such as Binance and Tether,\" he said.","The process conclusions come as the OCC moves closer to a change of leadership. The Biden administration has announced its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/123154\/biden-formalizes-nominee-to-lead-the-us-national-bank-regulator-what-does-she-think-about-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">nomination<\/a> for head of the OCC, formally tapping Saule Omarova, a professor at Cornell\u2019s Law School. Omarova faces resistance from Republicans, who have accused her of being decidedly \"anti-bank.\""],"hashtag":["OCC"]}
