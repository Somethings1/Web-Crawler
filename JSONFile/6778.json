Why do NFT brands need talent representation?&nbsp;","To get to the heart of these questions, MK sat down with UTA's head of web3, Lesley Silverman. Silverman has been at UTA for the past seven years, educating artists on the utility of web3 and helping interested artists launch their web3 brand. Before joining UTA, Silverman worked as a fine arts lawyer, and she says this experience shaped how she lead UTA through the NFT space.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this episode of NFT Scoop, Manoylov and Silverman discuss:&nbsp;<\/em>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors <a href=\"https:\/\/trondao.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tron<\/em><\/a>, <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chainalysis.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis<\/a>&nbsp;&amp; <\/em><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iwc.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IWC Schaffhausen<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/em><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About Tron<\/strong><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/em><\/b><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On August 1st, 2022, Poloniex launched a faster and more stable trading system along with a brand new user interface.
