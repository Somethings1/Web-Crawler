Bindseil and Schaaf said they disagreed with both claims, claiming their view that the fair value of Bitcoin is zero. They further argued that another boom and bust cycle for Bitcoin was a \u201Cdire perspective,\u201D and that the collateral damage would be \u201Cmassive\u201D \u2014 citing environmental damage and a redistribution of wealth at the expense of the \u201Cless sophisticated.\u201D","While the blog post states that the views expressed don\u2019t necessarily represent those of the ECB, both authors have roles with the central bank.
