These actions put the DAO, Lido stakers, and participating chains in a difficult position.\"","Regarding the community response, LayerZero told The Block that, \"the omnichain fungible-token standard is a multi-audited, open source set of reference contracts used by more than 75 projects to enable native, horizontally composable transfers between L1s and between L2s. More than $3 billion in value has been transferred by contracts that have integrated OFT.\"","\"By design, developers always maintain the ability to permissionlessly select their validation layer and can include other bridges as part of the immutable LayerZero framework. Once the Lido DAO accepts ownership of the contracts, wstETH on AVAX and BNB, a deployment organized with encouragement and feedback from Lido core team members, is entirely owned by Lido with no reliance on LayerZero Labs,\" it added.","© 2023 The Block.
