With the global crypto market cap losing $2 Trillion in value over the past year, investors are left apprehensive. While the future is trending towards decentralized finance (\u201CDeFi\u201D), reliability needs to be at the frontlines. This is where stablecoins come into play.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The type of stablecoins that have stood the test of volatile times are always fiat-backed. The advantage of having an actual asset backing the coin and the stability linked to knowing that the peg will remain the same, holds great importance throughout the DeFi ecosystem.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Today, almost all stablecoins are pegged solely to the United States dollar, which leaves behind and gives no representation for other foreign currencies. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Working with stablecoin issuers in foreign countries and their local crypto on-ramps will be necessary to onboard the world into DeFi. There is immense potential for foreign stablecoins to be adopted more broadly and we can validate this with Circle announcing their new EURO Coin (\u201CEUROC\u201D).

You can use the DFX protocol and its contracts to provide true financial localization for the customers of your global business or just safely earn yield on your stablecoins. The next generation of global finance cannot rely solely on USD-pegged stablecoins. A decentralized protocol where users can swap non-USD stablecoins pegged to various foreign currencies is not only important, but<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">necessary.
