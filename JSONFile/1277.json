Backed by a basket of currencies and government bonds, Libra will be part of a broader ecosystem, a new financial infrastructure <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/37430\/at-least-3-members-considering-cutting-ties-with-facebooks-libra-project-report\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook<\/a> hopes will play a role in the transformation of the lives of billions of people. Libra itself, and the network underpinning it, are set to launch in 2020. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CLibra holds the potential to provide billions of people around the world with access to a more inclusive, more open financial ecosystem,\u201D said David Marcus, the Facebook executive at the helm of its cryptocurrency operation, Calibra, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/41045\/facebooks-david-marcus-justifies-building-a-payments-network-on-blockchain-instead-of-traditional-banking-system\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook<\/a> spin-out aimed at building solutions and products related Libra. <\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Better than bitcoin?<\/strong>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Following in the footsteps of Ethereum, Tezos, and the myriad offerings in the cryptocurrency landscape, at the heart of Libra is the Libra Association, a Switzerland-based organization that oversees the currency's development and its network's maintenance. The governance structure isn\u2019t unique to the crypto world, but its inaugural members \u2014 each of which will have their own node granting them access to the network \u2014 include heavy hitters like Uber, PayPal, Visa, and Andreessen Horowitz. By the time Libra network fully launches, the association hopes to have 100 members, according to its white paper. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Founding members had to meet strict guidelines in line with its Evaluation Criteria. For instance, crypto hedge funds had to have an AUM above $1 billion while digital asset-focused custodians had to store at least $100 million. Non-crypto firms needed to have a market cap of more than $1 billion or boast customer balances equaling more than $500 million. A source familiar with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/40576\/facebook-acquires-chatbot-maker-for-calibra-wallet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook\u2019s<\/a> ambitions said it was originally looking to involve Wall Street institutions such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, but it was unable to secure their interest. JPMorgan announced the launch of its own settlement JPM Coin in February. <\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As for its network design, Libra <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">will start off on a permissioned blockchain, meaning only members of the Libra Association will be permitted to run the validator hardware required to participate in the consensus process. This is akin to the private blockchain instantiations supported by enterprise-focused firms like R3 and ConsenSys Solutions. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In Facebook's view, permissionless systems like Bitcoin are not ready for the big leagues \u2014 for now.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe challenge is that as of today we do not believe that there is a proven solution that can deliver the scale, stability, and security needed to support billions of people and transactions across the globe through a permissionless network,\u201D the whitepaper notes, conservatively quoting a throughput capacity of 1,000 transactions per second and a 10-second finality upon launch.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The permissioned nature of the Libra blockchain, with each of its 100 validator nodes operated by highly public entities, also means that it will be easier for stakeholders to coordinate in order to censor certain transactions.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Libra team anticipates that most people will choose to use custodial wallets, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/38721\/facebook-hires-two-more-lobbyists-for-libra-cryptocurrency-initiative\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook\u2019s<\/a> Calibra, in which case the wallet providers manage their customers' private keys and can choose to provide protections such as insurance, fraud protection, and customer service. The Block found that Calibra is already <a href=\"https:\/\/www.docdroid.net\/544Gxxg\/calibra-msb-registration.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">registered as an MSB<\/a> with the FinCEN in all U.S. states. Alternatively, s<\/span>imilar to other public cryptocurrencies, users can choose to use non-custodial wallets where they are responsible for their own keys and funds.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In many instances, Libra\u2019s blockchain takes inspiration from others, using Ethereum\u2019s account, gas, and smart contract model. Libra will also be open-source under an Apache 2.0 license, allowing developers to read, build, provide feedback, and take part in a bug bounty program. And yet Libra also brings its own innovations to the table in the form of its proprietary programming language and virtual machine, Move. Meanwhile, its LibraBFT consensus algorithm is closely modeled from the VMware's designed protocol, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cs.unc.edu\/~reiter\/papers\/2019\/PODC.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HotStuff<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the firm plans to transition Libra to a permissionless Proof-of-Stake based network within the next five years, the current estimated $280,000 annual cost to run a validator node may price out hobbyists. It\u2019s also not clear how smooth the transition will be. As Facebook admits, such a process could face numerous economic, technical, and governance-related hurdles. For instance, the Libra network will have to evolve its governance and consensus systems to account for increased validator distribution without giving up the performance guarantees required of a global payment processor. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The association will also have to iron-out the details of automating the management of its reserves - the assets that back the Libra currency (a collection of low-volatility government bonds and currencies from central banks, likely starting with USD, GBP, EUR, and JPY). For now, the whitepaper mentions further exploration of how to automate both the verification of assets in the basket and the minting and burning of coins. Libra is not alone in this: the difficulty of bringing verifiably correct real-world data onto a blockchain is commonly known as the \u2018oracle problem.\u2019<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Security token offering<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Every cryptocurrency community touts its promise to revolutionize financial services by bringing the borderless virtues of the Internet to money. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook is also betting that Libra will provide the foundations to meet the financial needs of billions of accounts. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To that end, Libra will have a war chest to execute on the firm's lofty goals with reserves from two sources: investors in the Libra Investment Token and Libra's users.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The issuance of the security token will cover the expenses of managing the network and supply members with coins which they can use to spur adoption among merchants and developers. Investors in the STO will receive rewards in the form of interest generated from the Libra reserves. Depending on the size of the Libra reserves, these dividends could be significant: with just 1.00% APR, a reserve of $160 billion worth of assets, the approximate size of Bitcoin\u2019s network value, would generate $1.6 billion per year in relatively low overhead income, as per The Block's estimates.&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Elephant in the room<\/strong>"],"hashtag":["PAYMENTS"]}
