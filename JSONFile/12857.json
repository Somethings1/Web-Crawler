However, the regulators say the acquisition announcements were a fraud aimed at selling DIG tokens at an inflated price, resulting in $36.8 million in DIG sold.&nbsp;","The OSC additionally alleged that Hogg and the companies used investor funds for purposes unrelated to the DIG tokens, including real estate purchases and payments to companies he controlled. It also highlights that Hogg failed to register a sale of DIG tokens with the OSC.","The OSC and SEC collaborated on parallel investigations, according to their statements. The agencies are seeking court orders in their respective jurisdictions that would halt the businesses, require them to pay back ill-gotten gains, bar the executives and firms from holding similar positions and pay to-be-determined monetary penalties.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
