Instead, the hearing will spill over into Friday in the&nbsp;U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.","The restructuring plan was approved by 97% of creditors who voted on the matter, lawyers said, although only 6% of Voyager\u2019s creditors actually voted. More than 167,000 Voyager customers \u2014representing $1.2 billion in customer claims \u2014 already have signed up for the Binance.US platform, according to a lawyer for the Voyager debtors.&nbsp;","The Securities and Exchange Commission and New York regulators are among those <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/214333\/sec-and-new-york-regulators-push-back-on-binance-uss-acquisition-of-voyager\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">objecting<\/a>&nbsp;to the Binance.US restructuring plan.","Wiles pressed the SEC on its objection, saying he was \u201Cshocked\u201D the regulator hadn\u2019t provided more evidence to the court.","\u201CI\u2019m shocked a regulator would come in and say \u2018I'm charged with regulatory authority over these things. These are reasons that I have concerns because they're within my regulatory jurisdiction, but I\u2019ve done nothing, I have nothing to offer to you except questions,\u2019\u201D Wiles said. \u201CThat\u2019s incredible.\u201D","Under the proposed sale, lawyers for the Voyager debtors said customers are expected to receive a 73% recovery. That percentage would drop to 48% if claims from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sibling company Alameda Research are successful.","Voyager has agreed to reserve $445 million after Alameda Research sued the defunct broker for loan repayments. The stipulation is subject to court approval.&nbsp;","While lawyers and a number of individual creditors cross-examined two witnesses during the hearing, Berkeley Research Group Managing Director Mark Renzi and Timothy Pohl, an independent director of Voyager Digital LLC, commotion broke out in the courtroom.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","An outburst by creditor Alah Shehadeh forced Wiles to pause the hearing and call out the man\u2019s \u201Ccontemptuous conduct\u201D and \u201Crefusal to listen to ordinary court rules.\u201D Wiles stopped the creditor from questioning a witness because Shehadeh had already asked questions earlier in the hearing. Shehadeh interrupted Wiles and called him a \u201Cterrible judge.\u201D<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CYou have forfeited any right to participate in this proceeding,\u201D Wiles said \u201CBoth by your contemptuous conduct, your refusal to listen to ordinary court rules and the fact that you continue to desire to treat this as a podium for you to scream about your grievances.\u201D","Shahedeh asked Wiles to \u201Cplease, please, please\u201D allow him to remain in the hearing, but he was removed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Throughout the hearing, Wiles urged creditors, who sometimes strayed from the topic at hand and expressed frustration about Voyager's circumstances, to keep their questions focused on the court agenda.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CIt's not an open mic. It's not a town hall. It's not a gripe session. It's not a radio call-in show for sports news or crypto news,\u201D Wiles said. \u201CWe are where we are.
