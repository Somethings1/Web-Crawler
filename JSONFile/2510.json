Core contributors from crypto projects Scroll, Mantle, Eigenlayer, GMX, Curve Finance, Convex Finance, Balancer, Aura Finance and Pendle Finance \u2014 as well as DAOs, including Frax Finance \u2014 also participated in the round.","The Curvance team describes the project as a DeFi \u201Ceverything app\u201D for lending and borrowing, designed to help address fragmentation across chains and protocols, which can serve as a barrier to entry. Curvance currently supports Ethereum and Layer 2s such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Scroll, Base and Polygon zkEVM \u2014 tapping into liquidity across decentralized exchanges like Curve, Balancer, Velodrome, GMX and Pendle in an attempt to improve cross-chain capital efficiency.","\u201CCurvance will give users of any blockchain an easy route to participate in Polygon DeFi, with the potential to make onboarding easier than ever,\u201D Nailwal said in the statement.","Curvance plans to use the funds to expand operations, boost security audits and recruit top talent in the DeFi market. \u201CWith this funding round, Curvance will be able to expand on its value proposition of bringing forward a more approachable money market experience for both DeFi newcomers and experienced yield farmers and traders alike,\u201D Curvance co-founder Chris Carapola said.","\"When we started looking for funding, we chose to talk to our partners first, instead of just going to venture capital firms,\u201D Curvance co-founder Michael Butcher explained. \u201CThis way, we ended up with a group of investors who care about our long-term success,\u201D adding he expected Curvance to launch on testnet soon.","Curvance is not the only project seeking to establish itself in the omni-chain money market sector. Radiant Capital, for example, built on top of LayerZero\u2019s interoperability protocol, currently supports lending and borrowing across Ethereum, Arbitrum and BNB Chain following a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/240713\/binance-labs-10-million-cross-chain-defi-lender-radiant-capital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$10 million investment<\/a> from Binance Labs in July. However, it could be more challenging for either to compete if DeFi lending incumbents such as Aave and Compound also moved into the niche.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
