The seasoned jurist spotlighted three instances in which Bankman-Fried committed perjury during his trial, including one instance in which the executive claimed he only became aware of the multi-billion-dollar hole in Alameda\u2019s balance sheets right before his crypto empire\u2019s spectacular implosion.","\u201CHe knew it was wrong. He knew it was criminal,\u201D Judge Kaplan said Thursday before a packed courtroom.&nbsp;","The crypto mogul, clad in a simple beige jumpsuit, remained stoic as he learned of his fate. Standing stiffly with his hands clasped together in front of him like a corpse in repose, he showed a noticeable shift in demeanor from his former kingpin persona. He bowed his head and bumbled through his final comments to the court in the lead-up to the judge's ruling.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI made selfish decisions,\u201D Bankman-Fried said in his remarks, which revisited several of the defense's key talking points during his weeks-long criminal trial. Among those arguments was the assertion that customers' funds were lost in a \u201Cliquidity crisis\u201D precipitated by FTX staff's mismanagement of users' accounts and the company's broader operations.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The former executive's prepared comments also included several nods to his colleagues and co-conspirators Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison and Nishad Singh.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThey built something really beautiful, and I threw all of that away,\" Bankman-Fried said.<\/span>","Bankman-Fried was found guilty on November 2 of seven criminal counts, including two counts each of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, as well as several counts of conspiracy to commit securities and commodities fraud, among other criminal acts. The maximum prison term for those crimes is 110 years, according to a probation officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Judge Kaplan recommended that Bankman-Fried serve time in a medium\u2014or low-security prison near the California Bay Area. The judge reasoned that the former FTX CEO\u2019s social skill deficiencies and \u201Cassociation with vast wealth\u201D make him a target for aggression by fellow inmates.&nbsp;","&nbsp;"],"hashtag":[]}
