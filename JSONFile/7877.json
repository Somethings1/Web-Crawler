The actual regulatory apparatus has been focusing closely on stablecoins for many months, with the President\u2019s Working Group November report [link] on the subject making it a top-priority legislative item.","As a consequence of both that report and President Biden\u2019s more recent executive order, many members of not just the regulators but the think tanks that flourish throughout DC have turned their attention to the area, though approaches to algorithmic stablecoins have been hesitant.","On May 9, Nellie Liang, who spearheaded the PWG report, moderated a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=okP7RNCtF18\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">panel<\/a> at the Atlanta Fed\u2019s Financial Markets Conference that focused on the outlook for central bank digital currencies, with guests from academia, think tanks and the Fed itself.","\u201CEven stablecoins now, which are basically not regulated prudentially, are subject to BSA AML requirements at the state level,\u201D said Liang.","One of Liang\u2019s guests, Paul Kupiec of the American Enterprise Institute, a major think tank, hosted a panel called \u201CBlockchain in the Beltway\u201D just last week, which likewise focused on private stablecoins, specifically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/140991\/senator-toomey-releases-draft-bill-setting-up-framework-for-stablecoins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Senator Pat Toomey\u2019s Stablecoin TRUST Act<\/a>. And AEI is not alone.","Heavy hitters among think tanks have been eager to put their stamps on the cryptocurrency conversation, from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/blog\/techtank\/2022\/03\/17\/how-bidens-executive-order-on-cryptocurrency-may-impact-the-fate-of-digital-currency-and-assets\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Brookings<\/a> to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.heritage.org\/markets-and-finance\/event\/bitcoin-and-the-american-experiment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Heritage Foundation<\/a> to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/event\/c-peter-mccolough-series-international-economics-james-bullard\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Council on Foreign Relations<\/a>.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aaron Klein, a senior fellow at Brookings who wrote about the impact of Biden's cryptocurrency executive order, described the interest as \"a combination of continuing long-run research into the broad field coupled with the growth of an industry that's booming.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"I'm working on plenty of aspects of it, including the rise of crypto's appeal among minority investors,\" Klein continued. \"There's a lot of work going on at Brookings, and other think tanks but particularly Brookings, into what's going on with stablecoins.\"<\/span>","It is part of the legislative process that high-priority items attract heavy-hitting intellectuals to the policy discussion. Some are relatively new to the crypto world but are having to get educated quickly. But others have engaged with crypto, at least tangentially, for years.&nbsp;","As with the PWG report, the focus is on stablecoins that depend on fiat-based reserve assets \u2014 the most common format for the biggest stablecoins, including USDT, USDC and BUSD.","However, the overall supply of stablecoins has stagnated, and even declined since early April:","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/total-stablecoin-supply-daily\/embed\" title=\"Total Stablecoin Supply\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","TerraUSD, the leading algorithmic stablecoin, was the notable exception to this trend. But the past two days, it has seen its peg slip, setting the stage for a new generation of regulatory proposals. The stablecoin, commonly known by the ticker UST, has since posted a recovery, and at press time is trading at roughly $0.90.","\u201CSome kinds of private stablecoins are legitimate payments mechanisms,\u201D Kupiec told The Block. \u201CThere are other kinds of stablecoins that I think it\u2019s much less clear that they\u2019re legitimate, and to me those are the algorithmic stablecoins.\u201D","Kupiec said he did not advocate for legislation addressing algorithmic stablecoins, but others disagree.","Rohan Grey is an associate professor at Willamette University is one and a co-author of crypto-related legislation like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/86460\/congress-stablecoin-legislation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">STABLE Act<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/139514\/new-bill-tasks-treasury-not-fed-with-digital-dollar-issuance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ECASH Act<\/a>.
