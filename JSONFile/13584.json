Then bitcoin prices plummeted from an all-time high last November, energy prices shot up and mining difficulty increased, pressuring margins and leading companies to the precipice.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"A lot of the companies that are going to not make it are the ones that put in big, big [hardware purchase] contracts last year when prices were peaking and now have little ability to get out of those contracts,\" said Christopher Brendler, a senior research analyst with D.A. Davidson. \"The only reason why some companies are better positioned is because they have either fixed-price or low-cost power.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dobson sees Core Scientific's filing as a \"black eye\" for the industry because of how quickly everything unraveled. D.A.

Its mining unit was Core Scientific\u2019s hosting client.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">D.A. Davidson also downgraded Argo to neutral over a lack of fixed power purchase agreements, a contract between electricity generators and buyers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The problem is in order to get a PPA, you've got to have a balance sheet ... to commit to an energy provider for a long term\" Brendler said. \"They could get a fixed price PPA, but they need to recap first. They need more equity.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Investors will be primarily watching for the health of balance sheets but \"likely gross mining margin will join it soon as some of the higher cost operators lose the ability to generate cash from their operations based on efficiency of mining equipment and cost of power,\" said Ethan Vera, COO of bitcoin infrastructure company Luxor Technologies.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Already declining profit margins are seeing even more pressure as the global hashrate spikes, resulting in greater mining difficulty. Vera said that hashprice \u2014 revenue miners earn from a unit of hashrate over a specific timeframe \u2014 traded down 34% in the third quarter compared to the previous one.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"With many miners already showing signs of weakness in Q2 we expect a few more to fall in negative gross margin territory,\" he said. \"This issue is exacerbated by few miners locking in fixed PPA electricity agreements, and suffering from higher costs.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One miner making strides in the bear market is CleanSpark, which has been<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/181685\/cleanspark-buying-spree-mining-machines\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">buying up thousands of discounted mining machines<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, as well as<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/168711\/bitcoin-miner-cleanspark-announces-second-acquisition-in-a-month\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">two mining sites<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The company has been particularly smart about its capital and is now reaping the benefits of not joining the rush to buy machines last year, Brendler said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"That's another proof point that it's really more about balance sheets and having the flexibility to take advantage of these times rather than being the biggest and the best,\" Brendler said. \"Even someone small like CleanSpark can not only survive, but they can thrive in this crypto winter.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On Tuesday, CleanSpark announced the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/181685\/cleanspark-buying-spree-mining-machines\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">purchase of another 3,843<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> latest-generation machines \u2014 the exact same number that Argo said it sold the day before.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CleanSpark isn\u2019t the only minder in good shape. Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital and BitFarms were all mentioned positively by analysts in the run-up to results.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Brendler expects a \"very strong quarter\" from Riot as it avoided higher electricity costs and profited from<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/161226\/riot-mined-28-less-bitcoin-in-july-and-earned-9-5-million-in-power-credits\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">selling power back to the grid<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in Texas. He maintained his buy rating on Riot as well as Marathon, which he said benefited from \"low-cost power, funded growth plans, and ample liquidity to capitalize on the impending shakeout.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Marathon is the most intriguing because their biggest hosting provider, Computing North, filed bankruptcy during the quarter. And yet, if you look at their pool, they're still mining and doing quite well,\" Brendler said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, \"investors are going to be very cautious heading into the earnings season, where it's crucial for Marathon and CleanSpark to convey to the street their strong financial footing,\" Luxor\u2019s Vera said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">H.C.
