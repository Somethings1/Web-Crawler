In January of this year, it became one of the 10 issuers of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. The fund has seen the least amount of inflows among all issuers at around $70 million, while others have collected billions of dollars of investors' money.","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"WisdomTree","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Graham Tuckwell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$70 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"WisdomTree Prime","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Financial Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"ETF Securities","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuckwell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\" Will Peck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2005","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jonathan Steinberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York Banking","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuckwell","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Steinberg","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["WisdomTree","WisdomTree Prime"],"authors":["Helene Braun"]}
