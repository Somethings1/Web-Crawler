Nagby, №16-cv-3038-BTM-WVG, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108871 (S.D. Cal. June 27, 2019) [SDP]<\/strong><\/em>","If you have been following the ongoing Kleiman v. Wright case in Florida federal court you know that the court is currently considering whether Craig Wright should be held in civil or criminal contempt of court. What does this mean? Is there anything special about contempt in crypto cases? A June 27, 2019 opinion from federal court in California suggests that the basic rules remain the same: cryptocurrency and lying to a federal judge don\u2019t go together very well, at least not if you\u2019re interesting in staying out of jail, and judges are free to disregard or discount the testimony of witnesses they don\u2019t believe.","This particular case arose out of a dispute involving commission payments in an insurance and reinsurance brokerage arrangement (which itself had nothing to do with cryptocurrency, btw). Plaintiffs said that defendants owed them a bunch of money and ended up getting a judgment against defendants of $3.2 million plus interest. They didn\u2019t pay the judgment, allegedly. Long story short \u2014 this lawsuit was filed to collect that judgment under legal theories and a statute that make transferring assets to avoid collection unlawful. (I am simplifying but that is the gist).","The Court issued a number of orders requiring one of the defendants to pay certain money in her possession to the Court\u2019s registry. She didn\u2019t. Order to Show Cause (\u201COSC\u201D) proceedings were held to show why she shouldn\u2019t be held in civil contempt. Following those proceedings, the Court held her in contempt.","The Court began (as courts do) by explaining the rules. A U.S. federal court \u201Chas the inherent power to enforce its orders through civil contempt. [In this particular federal circuit], a finding of civil contempt is proper when a party disobeys a specific and definite court order by failure to take all reasonable steps within the party\u2019s power to comply.\u201D Inability to comply is a defense but \u201Cthe party asserting the defense must show categorically and in detail why he is unable to comply.\u201D Furthermore, \u201C[a]t the contempt hearing, the propriety of the underlying order is not at issue; rather, the question for the Court is whether the alleged contemnor has the present ability to obey the Court\u2019s order.\u201D","Applying these rules to the facts at issue, the Court found defendants in contempt.","One of the orders at issue enjoined her from \u201Cselling, assigning, transferring, liquidating or withdrawing any funds, shares, equity interests or proceeds in relation to any \u2026 bitcoin.\u201D Also, \u201Cthe Court ordered that [she] must provide discovery, with respect to [a number of accounts] and bitcoin. Also, \u201C[t]he Court warned that \u2018[a]ny violation of this Order may be treated as a civil or criminal contempt and may subject the violator to arrest and prosecution for such contempt.\u2019\u201D","The Court said that defendants \u201Cfailed to produce documents and evidence\u201D regarding cryptocurrency, which violated a Court order. Also, the Court did not believe her claim that she had lost access to a $680,000 investment in Monero from the \u201CMega Chrome Extension Hack\u201D:","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ms. Dostalik produced no information or documents that she ever had an account at ShapeShift. If Ms. Dostalik\u2019s ShapeShift account was in fact hacked, there is no evidence, other than Ms. Dostalik\u2019s testimony. Ms. Dostalik also failed to produce any evidence that she took steps to recover her $680,000 investment, such as filing a police report or at the very minimum, contacting Shapeshift. Moreover, if Ms. Dostalik did lose account information as a result of a hack that she reported occurred in August 2018, then she must have [*28] managed to create a new or separate account for the purpose of the cryptocurrency investment that she testified occurred in September. She failed to disclose any information about a new or separate account.<\/em>","The Court said this also violated a Court Order and that willfulness isn\u2019t an element in a contempt proceeding the defendant acted willfully, \u201Cdeceitfully and with little regard or respect for Court orders.\u201D Among other things, \u201C after the Court ordered Ms. Dostalik to sign a consent directive instructing Caye International Bank to comply with discovery requests, she sent Caye Bank an altered copy with the majority of the directive crossed out. (Even though the Court denied Ms. Dostalik\u2019s motion to include \u201Cunder protest\u201D with her signature, Ms. Dostalik hand wrote this language on the altered copy. She also wrote: \u201CForced to sign under duress, under protest and without A jury trial, as Requested. Do Not Follow this. Court Order. I was forced to sign this against my will without a jury trial. You do not have my authorization to Release any Records or any Funds.\u201D","The Court also largely disregarded her testimony because she demonstrated that she is \u201Can unreliable witness\u201D with gaps and contradictions in her testimony. Thus her self-serving testimony about not being able to comply with the Court\u2019s order \u2014 disregarded.","So \u2026 what happens when you\u2019re found in civil contempt? In this case, the Court gave her 14 days to pay a chunk of money and to show up in court at the end of that time to do so. If she doesn\u2019t comply \u2014 \u201Cshe shall then and there surrender to the U.S. Marshal to be confined until she purges her contempt.\u201D In other words, jail.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
