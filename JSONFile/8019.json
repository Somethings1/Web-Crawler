Delphi Ventures, LongHash and Nomad also participated in the round, the company said in a statement.","Neutron serves as a Cosmos-based network designed for writing smart contracts using CosmWasm, a computational environment within the Cosmos ecosystem, while simultaneously allowing developers to write code in the Rust programming language.&nbsp;","Neutron aims to provide cross-chain, smart contract applications for the Cosmos network of more than 50 interconnected, app-specific blockchains or appchains by closely aligning with the Cosmos Hub and leveraging its high security.","\"The market demand for appchains and L2s is growing rapidly and Neutron enables mission-critical tooling while also supporting Rust, the second-most popular smart contracting language in the world,\" said Alex Felix, chief investment officer at CoinFund.","The company didn't disclose the valuation seen in the round.&nbsp;","Neutron launched in May after becoming the first Cosmos blockchain to go live using Replicated Security, a feature that allows so-called consumer chains to tap into the validators of the Cosmos Hub, the central and oldest chain in the Cosmos ecosystem, to gain the ability to run secure applications in a cost-effective way.","\"The Cosmos ecosystem has significant potential and, as its first consumer chain, Neutron is driving the development of secure, developer-friendly cross-chain infrastructure,\" said Yi He, co-founder of Binance and head of Binance Labs.","The funds raised will be directed toward supporting the expansion of the Neutron ecosystem and incentivize development of new dApps, the team said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
