It sits behind crypto VC firm a16z, which has 6.7% of the vote.","That's causing some concern for Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, who is worried that Binance may use tokens that are owned by the exchange's users to participate in governance for its own reasons.","This is a \u201Cvery unique situation, as the UNI technically belongs to its users,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/haydenzadams\/status\/1582714218323017729\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> Adams on Twitter. Normally more governance participation is good, he said, noting that it is unclear how Binance plans to engage with the governance system.","The amount Binance has delegated represents 1.3% of the total supply of UNI. This is above the 0.25% threshold for proposing governance votes but below the 4% quorum required for votes to pass. The threshold for proposing votes was recently reduced following a <a href=\"https:\/\/app.uniswap.org\/#\/vote\/0\/4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">governance vote<\/a>.","Binance wasn't immediately available to comment.","Â© 2023 The Block.
