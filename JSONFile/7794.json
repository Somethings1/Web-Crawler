One of those sources said the company is looking to raise $35 million.&nbsp;","That would be significantly more than what Messari banked from investors in August last year, when Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Ventures \u2014 the venture arm of a hedge fund that manages $24 billion in assets \u2014 led <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/113564\/steve-cohens-point72-makes-first-crypto-venture-investment-leads-messaris-21m-raise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a $21 million Series A fundraise<\/a>. It would also roughly triple the company\u2019s valuation.","Messari\u2019s founder and CEO Ryan Selkis declined to comment on the raise, but said via Twitter message: \u201CWe\u2019re continuing to build crypto\u2019s largest subscription information business, and are focused on getting ready to release a slate of new products at Mainnet [a conference organized by Messari] this September! More news to share then.\u201D","He added that the startup does not need money and has \u201Cnever spent a dime of investor capital while scaling to 130 people.\u201D","News of the raise comes just a week after Messari announced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/160992\/messari-acquires-crypto-fundraising-intelligence-database-dove-metrics\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the acquisition<\/a> of Dove Metrics, which tracks fundraising and M&amp;A activity in the crypto sector. The terms of that deal were not disclosed. &nbsp;","Messari is a part of a small cadre of increasingly well-capitalized startups whose mission is to arm institutions dabbling in crypto with the analytics tools and research needed to navigate the space. Its rivals include the likes of Kaiko, Delphi Digital, Nansen, Dune Analytics, and The Block's own Research unit.

The proceeds of the company\u2019s $21 million round went towards expanding its institutional footprint, in part by scaling a research tool that helps institutional clients with onbarding, integration and support for new crypto assets. Kraken Ventures, Alameda Capital and CMS Ventures were also among its Series A backers.","Messari\u2019s boss Selkis was part of the founding team behind Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group (DCG), where he managed the firm\u2019s seed investments, before moving to DCG-owned CoinDesk in the role of managing director.","Â© 2023 The Block.
