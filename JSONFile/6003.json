By enabling a party to authenticate a statement\u2019s truth without revealing any additional information, ZK proofs can substantially address Bitcoin\u2019s challenges related to transaction speeds and network congestion, ZeroSync said.","ZeroSync\u2019s verifier is a notable development for light clients, enabling them to verify inclusion of transactions on Bitcoin nearly instantaneously, with the client storing only a header chain proof rather than downloading all block headers.","\u201CThis lowers the barriers of entry to participate as a first-class citizen in the Bitcoin network by orders of magnitude,\u201D said Robin Linus, co-founder of ZeroSync. \u201CLong-term, we hope to bring mass scalability to Bitcoin using Stark Proofs. ZeroSync has designed and is currently implementing a Layer 2 protocol that has remarkable privacy and scalability properties, allowing Bitcoin to process more than 100 token transactions per second. This could be a major feat in bringing Bitcoin towards the scalability it needs.\u201D","ZeroSync said it had met its first major milestone by releasing a verifier for the Bitcoin network\u2019s header chain as part of its ZK client for the network. Bitcoin light clients, which are wallets, use block headers and a mechanism known as simple payment verification (SPV) to verify transactions.","The next step for ZeroSync is to provide verification of the entire blockchain to nodes without the need for them to download and process the data. \u201CThe ultimate goal is to have a zero-knowledge proof verifier on Bitcoin\u2019s mainnet,\u201D Linus added.","Â© 2023 The Block.
