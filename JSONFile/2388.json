The office has accused Yu of violating Korea's Capital Markets Act.","Yu is the person's second name; first name was not disclosed. In Korea, authorities don't often reveal the full names of detained people.","The prosecutors' office has reportedly also requested a bench warrant for Yu. Yu was said to be already on the list of the arrest warrants that were issued last month for Kwon and six of his colleagues.","A bench warrant allows prosecutors to keep a person detained during a trial if they think the person might run away during the trial period.","Whether Yu continues to be detained or not will be determined by the court, and a decision could come as soon as today, per the JTBC report. If the court approves the prosecutors' bench warrant application, Yu will continue to be detained, and if not, he could be part of a non-custodial investigation, according to the Korean court system.","Yu was reportedly a key aide of Kwon, the creator of the Terra ecosystem, which imploded in May and wiped out around $40 billion in investor wealth.
