Further, it provides a channel for valuable community feedback, whether it's about improving documentation or spotting an overlooked bug.\u201D","The Base Layer 2 network on Ethereum is built on OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism. \u201CSupporting open source has been one of our key tenets since we announced the testnet at the start of the year,\u201D Base Senior Software Engineer Anika Raghuvanshi told The Block. \u201COur goal is to be decentralized, permissionless, and open to anyone. We joined Optimism as a Core Dev on the open source OP Stack, and open sourcing Base\u2019s contracts and frontend is a continuation of our commitment to building a technology that is open for everyone.\u201D","By open-sourcing its smart contract repositories (or repos), the core Base team aims to provide developers with increased transparency around its development. All contracts and scripts are now <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/base-org\/contracts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">publicly available<\/a> on GitHub, offering insights into various on-chain actions, from contract deployments to upgrades.","Open-sourcing is an important concept within the crypto industry and a key part of its ethos. It enables transparency over operations and allows for community-based auditing, so vulnerabilities can be seen and fixed faster. On the other hand, it may also make it easier for malicious actors to exploit such vulnerabilities.","Encouraging developers to check out its codebase, the project is also offering a bounty payout of up to $1,000,000 for bug discovery via the Coinbase HackerOne <a href=\"https:\/\/hackerone.com\/coinbase\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bounty program<\/a>.","In addition to smart contracts, Base has also open-sourced its web properties, including base.org, docs.base.org, and bridge.base.org. This is again designed to boost transparency and encourage developers to contribute and provide feedback. For example, developers can delve into the code responsible for Base\u2019s deposits and withdrawals, providing a blueprint for those looking to craft similar functions.","Earlier this year, Base outlined its <a href=\"https:\/\/base.mirror.xyz\/aBwt4flT1WAKJGQTj2AXBpH_8Qd3umQ-ZECLAJoO_nE\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">commitment to decentralization<\/a> with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236277\/optimism-changes-name-to-op-mainnet-in-line-with-superchain-vision\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Superchain<\/a> \u2014 Optimism\u2019s vision to create a network of many Layer 2 blockchains.","Base said at the time it plans to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247268\/coinbase-base-optimism\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fully decentralize<\/a> the network in the future by implementing fault proofs and using diverse client software to keep the network censorship-resistant. However, there is no specific timeline for this transition. It also plans to assist in forming a \"security council\" for the Superchain \u2014 aimed at implementing further checks and balances on the security and decentralization of Base, Optimism and related chains.","\u201CBase is still committed to decentralization and strengthening the OP Stack. Decentralization is critical for the success of Base and scaling Ethereum,\u201D Raghuvanshi added. \u201CTechnical improvements need to mature before Layer 2s can safely reach higher degrees of decentralization. We\u2019re working closely with the Optimism Collective to decentralize the OP Stack and Base. An effort like this will take time and collaboration from many parties.\u201D","Base said it would continue its commitment to the open-source community by contributing to projects like the OP Stack and introducing improved open-source tools for the ecosystem.","Base's seven-day moving average <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/scaling-solutions\/optimistic-rollups\/transaction-count-daily-7dma\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">transaction count<\/a> fell below optimistic rollup rival Arbitrum recently, ending an approximate month-long dominance for the Base Layer 2 that only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243899\/base-mainnet-onchain-summer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> to the public on Aug. 9. The average has fallen around 65% from almost 1.5 million in September to under 500,000, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/scaling-solutions\/optimistic-rollups\/transaction-count-daily-7dma\/embed\" title=\"Transaction Count on Optimistic Rollups (Daily, 7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","\u201CWe\u2019re excited to see the energy in Layer 2 activity overall,\u201D Raghuvanshi said. \u201CBase has seen great momentum since we launched the mainnet in August. We\u2019re first and foremost committed to our builders and helping them bring decentralized tech to a billion users.\u201D","Last month, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252477\/base-token-not-ruled-out-entirely-coinbase-clo-paul-grewal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">new token<\/a> for Base had not been ruled out entirely.
