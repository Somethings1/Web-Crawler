He declined to provide details of the financing.","","","\u201CThe enthusiasm around the initial sale gave us the confidence to secure financing for a proper pilot,\u201D Colon said. \"Dominion X\" sold 500 NFTs in 30 seconds earlier this month, emboldening Aoki on his NFT trip\u2019s silver-screen potential.","","","Investing in a pilot episode does not guarantee success for \u201CDominion X\"; a distributor like Fox or Netflix would still have to buy the rights, and that\u2019s hardly assured. But it's the first step on the road to broadcast, and it comes as networks like Fox place nine-figure bets on the intersection of NFTs and television.","","","Aoki told CoinDesk he wholeheartedly believes that NFTs will be a \u201Cpart of culture\u201D within five years \u2013 TV culture included. Against that backdrop, the self-described \u201Cspeculator\u201D would naturally try to get a piece of the early action.","","","What makes a TV show an \u201CNFT show\u201D is far from clear; \u201CDominion X\u201D is just one of two to make waves this month. The other, a star-studded animated series called \u201CStoner Cats,\u201D can only be viewed by people who buy associated NFTs. ","","","By contrast, the \u201Clevel 1\u201D of \u201CDominion X\u201D can be watched by anyone with an internet connection. Its 500 NFTs are splices of the episode, not keys to the castle. Selling them on Nifty Gateway turned a quick but modest buck \u2013 Colon said it \u201Cbarely covered\u201D production costs.","","","\u201CUltimately the goal wasn\u2019t to finance a television show as much as it was to show that there\u2019s a market for original IP on the blockchain,\u201D Colon said.","","","The first episode of Aoki\u2019s super-meta metaverse show would certainly qualify as original blockchain IP: It\u2019s basically an NFT of an NFT. (Aoki debuted the star character of \u201CDominion X\u201D in his March NFT collaboration \u201CDream Catcher\" with digital artist Antoni Tudisco.)","","","\u201CDream Catcher\u201D made millions as it showcased how Aoki\u2019s star power (and more than a hint of market froth) could turn digital art into unusually large artist paydays. Its follow-up, an online-only TV episode, wasn't trying to top that so much as show the idea had legs. ","","","The market responded with a load of fast cash on Aug. 2. Packs containing one of 10 scenes sold out within 30 seconds on Nifty, said Adam Bauer, a representative for Ether Cards, the startup that minted NFTs of the three-minute short.","","","Owners traded over $50,000 worth of \u201CDominion X\u201D NFTs in the week that followed, Colon said, generating more revenue for Aoki and his team. That\u2019s because the NFT smart contract takes a hard-coded 10% cut of every sale on the secondary market.","","","He\u2019s hoping to \u201Cexponentially\u201D goose those sales with the upcoming rollout of \u201Ccollectors rewards\u201D that make the lot more appealing, in part by making each NFT more interactive.","","","\u201CEveryone in this space is always thinking about how to level up, how to keep adding more utility,\u201D Aoki told CoinDesk during a sidebar at Chicago\u2019s Lollapalooza earlier this month.","","","Holders will be able to exchange Dominion NFTs for un-minted scenes, according to Ether Cards. And the buyer of the 1-of-1 NFT will be listed as \u201CDominion X\u201D co-producer if the show ever gets made.",""],"entity":[{"type":"Aoki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Antoni Tudisco","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Stoopid Buddy Stoodios","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Matt Colon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lollapalooza","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"earlier this month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aug. 2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Netflix","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$50,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Stoner Cats","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nifty","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ether Cards","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nifty Gateway","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Colon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Seth Green","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201D Colon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chicago","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Steve Aoki","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Adam Bauer","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["music industry","NFTs","Steve Aoki"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
