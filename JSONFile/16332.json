It noted that while transaction activity grew, the number of active daily users decreased 4% \u2014 the fourth drop in address activity in the past five quarters.","\u201CThe ratio of transactions to active addresses has been growing steadily over the past five quarters, suggesting that the average user is more active now than they previously were,\u201D the report said. \u201CIn Q2, the Transaction \/ Active Address ratio of 1.19 was up 6.1% QoQ and 13.2% YoY.\u201D","Blockchain load \u2014 a measure of how much data is contained in blocks over a certain period \u2014 rose to 50% from under 40% in the previous three months.

Epochs refer to the time periods on Cardano, with epoch lasting 432,000 slots and each slot being one second.","ADA tokens are staked during these epochs during which new blocks on the Cardano network are produced, potentially increasing demand for the tokens as block rewards become more lucrative, based on activity.","In March, a feature on Milkomeda, a network that connects blockchains to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, began to allow Cardano blockchain users to gain access to EVM smart contracts with any cardano (ADA) wallet, expanding the ecosystem's usefulness.","An Ethereum Virtual Machine is where all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live, serving as a virtual computer used by developers to create dapps.","The new feature will allow Ethereum application developers to build on Cardano\u2019s network using Solidity \u2014 the computer language used to code Ethereum \u2014 without needing to install new toolkits or learn a new computer language.","Such applications can then be used solely with Cardano tokens instead of ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum network, increasing the tokens' utility for holders.","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Milkomeda","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"81%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Transaction \/ Active Address","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"6.1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$175 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum Virtual Machine","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"13.2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Messari","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$340 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"second quarter","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Cardano","ADA","Tech","On-chain Data"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
