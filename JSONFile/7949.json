There was a need for a tool that stored blockchain data to the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). In 2018, they participated in ETH Berlin and won the hackathon with Pinata\u2019s earliest prototype. In 2019, they continued building out the Pinata product through relationships with NFT builders and developers at other hackathons.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CDuring this time, we saw early inklings that NFTs were an important concept, but the NFT market was still nonexistent,\u201D shared Kyle Tut, CEO and co-founder.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the spring of 2020, when many were in lockdown during the early days of the pandemic, the team noticed more activity happening within the metaverse.
