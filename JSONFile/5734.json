Kirsten Gillibrand said on Tuesday.","\u201CThere's more urgency now, and also more of a sense that this is something we need to do,\u201D Gillibrand said.

Gillibrand and Sen. Cynthia Lummis<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> joined the panel via video.&nbsp;<\/span>","Gillibrand released a wide-ranging crypto regulation bill with Lummis in June. The legislation lays out which aspects of the crypto landscape should be regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission, among other issues.","\"Most of my colleagues were fairly alarmed with the different market impacts over the last couple of months, and the number one question is: does this regulation either prevent that or improve transparency and accountability? Does it improve safety and soundness? Does it improve consumer protections? And obviously the answer is yes, that's why we wrote the bill,\u201D Gillibrand said. \u201CThere's additional interest now because they've seen that this is something that's important to do, that consumers are not being protected today. There's no oversight and accountability, and there are no rules of the road.\"","Crypto legislation has been a relatively niche issue, but&nbsp;<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Washington lawmakers are looking more closely at regulation amid chaos in the crypto market, Gillibrand and Lummis said.
