Kwon accepted and transferred $10 million worth of stablecoins to be held in escrow pending the outcome of the wager.","GCR says he later sought to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GiganticRebirth\/status\/1522904319619747841\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">up the ante<\/a> by proposing bets of $50 million and then $20 million \u2014 although Kwon didn't respond to either offer. After being rebuffed, GCR says he's turned to the financial markets to profit if LUNA declines.","\u201CUpdate on \u2018the bet\u2019,\" GCR <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GiganticRebirth\/status\/1522903921492168705\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> to his 114,000 followers on May 7. \"Since my 20 million wasn't able to be matched on LUNA, I made the bet by myself with derivatives.\u201D&nbsp;","Speaking to The Block on Monday, GCR said he believes LUNA will decline under the pressure of other Layer 1 networks launching their own high-yield decentralized stablecoins. GCR likened the situation to how OlympusDAO forks contributed to taking market share from the original \u2014 as the success of one project tends to spawn imitators who will drain liquidity from the original.","GCR advertised the trade on his Twitter account, showing a $10.3 million short position on LUNA at an open price of about $90.","The trade is sitting on a 33% profit, based on the current price of LUNA, netting GCR about $3.5 million in unrealized gains. GCR says he is not worried that advertising his short position could spur efforts to liquidate him.","\"I think for LUNA to liquidate me, the market cap would have to reach the level of Saudi Aramco or something; [I] have quite a good amount of margin,\" GCR told The Block. Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, is worth more than $2 trillion.","LUNA enjoyed a significant price run-up following Kwon\u2019s bet and reached an all-time high of $119 in early April.","Since then, the price of LUNA has fallen sharply, down almost 50% from its peak, a situation further exacerbated by UST, he most popular stablecoin on the Terra ecosystem, temporarily <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/145676\/ust-stablecoin-struggles-to-maintain-1-parity-amid-crypto-market-turbulence\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">becoming de-pegged<\/a> over the weekend.
