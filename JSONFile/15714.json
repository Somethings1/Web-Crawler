Wrapped tokens are synthetic (or tokenized) versions of crypto assets that are not native to the blockchains on which they exist.","Read more: Polkadot Now Has a Decentralized Version of 'Wrapped' Bitcoin","Interlay says its new bitcoin DeFi hub plans to fill the void left by the closure of peer-to-peer bitcoin exchanges like LocalBitcoins and Paxful earlier in the year and the multi-billion dollar flight from two of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges \u2013 Binance and Coinbase \u2013 precipitated by the current U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits targeting the two centralized platforms.","\u201CLocalBitcoins closed, Paxful had issues,\u201D said Interlay CEO and Co-founder Alexei Zamyatin in an interview with CoinDesk. \u201CWe focus on trying to unlock additional functionality for bitcoin and we try to be an alternative to centralized exchanges.\u201D","The 30-year-old computer science PhD graduate describes the new platform as a combination of Uniswap, a popular DEX and Aave and Compound, open-source protocols for liquidity and lending, respectively.","The hub reportedly features not only bitcoin (BTC), but also tether (USDT), polkadot (DOT), and Interlay\u2019s governance token INTR. Liquid staking tokens, or portable tokens that represent staked cryptocurrencies \u201Care expected in Q3\u201D while assets from Ethereum and Cosmos may become available by year\u2019s end, according to the project.","This cornucopia of tokens may irk some Bitcoin purists, but Zamyatin says it\u2019s a necessary step in bringing \u201CBitcoin to one billion people.\u201D","\u201CFinancial freedom means different things to different people,\u201D Zamyatin explained. \u201CFor some, it means that they can hedge against fiat by buying bitcoin and just holding it, but not everybody earns and has enough capital to be able to just put something aside and use it as an investment. There's a lot of people globally who see bitcoin as access to a financial system,\u201D he added."],"entity":[{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alexei Zamyatin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Paxful","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Zamyatin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","DeFi","Wrapped Bitcoin","Polkadot","Exclusive"],"authors":["Frederick Munawa"]}
