The purpose of the transfer was to give the foundation capital to invest in initiatives built using Arbitrum's technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;","The proposal appeared set to go ahead without the approval of token holders \u2014 who make up the decentralized autonomous organization or DAO that in theory governs Arbitrum \u2014 who had voted overwhelmingly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/224444\/arbitrum-sells-tokens-aip1?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">against<\/a> the move. Arbitrum initially tried to style the vote as a \u201Cratification.\u201D&nbsp;","But the project has seemingly now bowed to the pressure, after Arbitrum community lead named eli_defi conceded in a Discord post late on Sunday that AIP-1 \u201Clikely will not pass\u201D and committing to addressing the concerns of its community.","\u201CAIP-1 is too large and covers too many topics. We will follow the DAO\u2019s advice and split the AIP into parts. This will allow the community to discuss and vote on the different subsections,\u201D wrote eli_defi.","Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling project, is the hot ticket in DeFi circles at present, having <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222205\/arbitrum-airdrop-token-claim-live\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">airdropped<\/a> its prized tokens to nearly 300,000 users a few weeks ago \u2014 a transfer of value worth close to $1.5 billion at current market prices. The airdrop helped create the Arbitrum DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that in theory gives holders a say, as well as a stake, in the development of the project. The events of this weekend cast some doubt on that, as well as on just how decentralized the outfit is.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Arbitrum attempted damage control late on Sunday. Its lengthy Discord post also addressed critics who had <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chestbrook\/status\/1642570786518052868\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">highlighted on-chain transfers of 50 million ARB tokens<\/a>, which appeared to represent sales. Arbitrum\u2019s eli_defi said that 10 million tokens were sold by the Arbitrum Foundation to \u201Cfund pre-existing contracts and to pay for near-term operating costs.\u201D That was a necessary step because the foundation is a separate entity from Offchain Labs, the New York-based developer of Arbitrum, they claimed, and needed to fund itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;","\u201CThe Foundation does not exist to sell tokens, only sold enough to fund its current operating expenses and has no near-term plans to sell more tokens,\u201D eli_defi wrote.","Arbitrum\u2019s community lead added that, to address community feedback, the allocation of 750 million ARB tokens to the foundation would now be voted on in a separate proposal, and that transparency reports covering how funds are spent over time will be published.","Blockchain sleuths first <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Cringe\/status\/1642500640218939393?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised concerns<\/a> over the transfer of the 750 million ARB tokens, as well as the sale of 50 million tokens without DAO approval, in mid-March. It is not clear exactly what Arbitrum\u2019s promise of a separate proposal on that transfer means, given that the tokens have seemingly already been sent to the foundation.","The community lead conceded that the so-called \u201Cspecial grants program\u201D \u2014 which the 750 million ARB transfer was originally part of \u2014 is vague and \u201Clacks DAO involvement.\u201D It will be renamed the Ecosystem Development Fund, providing more information on use of funds, they added.","Â© 2023 The Block.
