But instead, it relies on the TON blockchain network to transfer data files of any size, which are backed-up and encrypted without needing centralized web servers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Traditional torrents lack long-term storage guarantees. TON Storage aims to overcome this by offering financial incentives to node operators on the network, with smart contracts ensuring users pay them a fixed amount in toncoin to host files for a certain amount of time.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAnyone can become a node operator on the TON network and receive payments from other users for hosting files <\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u2014 <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">even if operating just one node,\u201D the TON Foundation said in a statement. \u201CThe accessibility of this new product will incentivize new, independent users to join the TON network, helping to grow the TON ecosystem even further,\u201D it added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Telegram began exploring blockchain technology in 2018, developing the Telegram Open Network, as it was then known. It raised $1.7 billion in a private sale of toncoin tokens the same year, but Telegram abandoned the project following SEC investigations. In 2022, open-source developers saved and rebranded it as The Open Network with a functional mainnet.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In October, Telegram <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/191054\/telegram-sells-usernames-worth-50-million-on-the-open-network-blockchain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">allowed<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> users to buy usernames for its messaging app via the decentralized auction platform Fragment, based on The Open Network. With the launch of TON Storage, TON-secured sites can also be hosted on the network, a move that TON Foundation founding member Anatoly Makosov said marks \u201Cthe next step in realizing our vision of a decentralized, open internet.\u201D<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
