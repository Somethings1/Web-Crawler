Seventy-five percent of all investors and sixty-eight percent of those interested in investing in bitcoin say crime is their paramount fear.&nbsp;","Indeed, there has been a number of hacks in the cryptocurrency market. According to The Block\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/04\/01\/research-cryptocurrency-exchange-hacks-surpass-1-3-billion-all-time-61-coming-from-2018\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">research<\/a>, the total amount stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges to date now stands at nearly $1.39 billion.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What bitcoiners look like<\/strong>","Despite bitcoiners being associated with America's youth, most interested investors are parents.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nBitcoin-interested investors are often middle-aged, middle-class and suburban, and most (70%) are parents and nearly half (49%) make less than $100,000 per year, Grayscale said. They are also slightly more experienced and risk-tolerant than average investors, it added.","One thing that appeals the most to them is that they can invest small amounts in the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin\u2019s growth potential and scarcity (limited supply of 21 million units) are some other appealing factors.","Grayscale said its research has shown that even a small allocation to cryptocurrencies can increase overall portfolio performance by only \u201Cmodestly increasing\u201D risk. The asset manager further said, according to its hypothetical simulations, over the period from Sept. 25, 2013 to June 30, 2019, adding just 5% in bitcoin to a simulated global 60% stock and 40% bond portfolio more than doubled cumulative returns from 41.9% to 90.9%.","Grayscale finally said more education from financial advisors and other intermediaries would help them move away from the sidelines as the future of investing is digital and bitcoin is \"here to stay.\u201D"],"hashtag":[]}
