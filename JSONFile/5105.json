A burning mechanism and the ability to always be able to sell $1 worth of LUNA for 1 UST are designed to keep it in check. Yet critics say the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/144858\/very-stable-geniuses-the-race-to-build-regulation-proof-stablecoins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">success of this operation<\/a> depends on the strength of LUNA's price and on its key DeFi platform, Anchor, continuing to produce an up to 20% yield to incentivize liquidity \u2014 something that's on track to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/145450\/terras-dominant-defi-protocol-may-need-another-bailout-soon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">run out soon<\/a> barring any fixes.","Evidence for traders selling UST can be seen in the Wormhole bridge, a platform designed to exchange assets across blockchains.

UST <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/queries\/684097\/1268955\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">now comprises<\/a> 78% of the pool, implying that traders have been selling it for other stablecoins.","In light of such concerns, the Terra ecosystem has been stockpiling bitcoin to use as a backstop. On the back of the initial de-pegging from the dollar, Terra has said it will lend out $750 million of bitcoin to market making firms to buy UST and help return the peg to its $1 mark.","Yet there appears to be strong downwards pressure on the peg. After falling to $0.98 initially, the price of UST rose as high as $0.986 \u2014 before falling back down again.","As for the price of LUNA, it has fallen 14% today to $55 among a general crypto market downturn. It is now down 54% from its all-time high of $118 in April.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
