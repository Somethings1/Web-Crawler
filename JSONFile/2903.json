The unknown figure behind the NFT sale made $138,000 and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/119150\/supposed-17-year-old-artist-sells-138000-worth-of-fake-nfts-and-disappears\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">disappeared with the money<\/a>, leaving a deleted Twitter account in their wake.","Only on Sunday did the artist who created the images \u2014 that were shown as previews of the collection \u2014 hear about the sale for the first time.","\u201CIt was kind of upsetting that someone takes and use your work like that,\u201D said 27-year-old artist Ludvig Holmen. \u201CAlthough it was nice to see the work has been appreciated by somebody, without me knowing it as well.\u201D","Based in London, Holmen is currently studying architecture at the Architectural Association. While he did a lot of drawing when he was younger and some 3D modelling, it was through architecture that he got more serious about making art.","In February, Holmen heard about NFTs when Beeple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/98047\/christies-beeple-auction-ends-digital-art\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sold one for $69 million<\/a>. Shortly after, he decided to do his own run of NFTs, selling a set of rotating 3D NFTs \u2014 called <a href=\"https:\/\/rarible.com\/golemfactory\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">GolemFactory<\/a> \u2014 for 17 ETH ($59,000 at current prices).&nbsp;","Holmen also created a set of 25 3D digital figurines, custom designing each one, in a collection called Kingdoms Of Ether. His original idea was to sell them as NFTs but he wasn\u2019t sure how to produce enough to make a reasonably sized collection, given they were all individually made. Plus, as a student, he didn\u2019t have much spare time.&nbsp;","\u201CWe had been discussing the idea of doing something like that. But the difficulty of pulling it off and keeping the standard of models, made us refrain from doing so \u2014 it\u2019s a huge undertaking,\u201D he said, referring to his friend who handled the coding side of things on his Golem project.","So he was not only surprised when he found out someone had used his artwork for a pretend NFT sale but that there had actually been high demand for it, with the presale selling out in minutes.","\u201CIt\u2019s interesting to see it\u2019s exactly what we had been talking about doing and the guy pretends to do it,\u201D he said.","Holmen said he was aware that some of the victims of the rugpull had banded together to try to find a solution that would benefit those who lost money. While he hasn\u2019t been able to get in touch with them yet, he added that he was open to helping out in some way.","\u201CI really want to reach out to the people who bought into the project and see what they think about the project in the first place. It would be a shame if there was excitement about the project and I certainly don\u2019t want them to think I was the one who pulled this scam,\u201D he said.","Holmen said that something along the lines of free giveaways to people who were affected by the scam might be an option. So while the NFT mint was a sleazy rugpull, it might not be game over."],"hashtag":["BEEPLE"]}
