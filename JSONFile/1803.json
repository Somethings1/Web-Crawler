This should result in lower transaction fees and circumvent constraints in StarkWare\u2019s existing prover, Stone, according to the StarkWare team.","\u201CWith great speed comes great possibility,\u201D StarkWare COO Oren Katz said in a statement shared with The Block. \u201CStwo will bring new possibilities for scaling. And they\u2019ll be available for everyone, given that it will be open-source from day one [under the Apache 2.0 permissive free software license].\u201D","As the engine that powers Starknet\u2019s tech stack, the prover is a system that can confirm transactions are valid without needing to share all the details on the main blockchain. It does this by creating a special kind of cryptographic proof to compress transactions.","\u201CIt\u2019s especially exciting that just a week after the new Circle STARK protocol was announced as a theoretical breakthrough, this protocol is already springing to life with the development of this blazingly fast prover,\u201D Katz said.","\u201CThe prover is the magic wand of STARK technology. It plays a key role in scaling Ethereum,\u201D he added. \u201CThe implementation of Circle STARK in Stwo will help supercharge Ethereum scaling by more efficiently generating proofs.\u201D","Developed in collaboration with cryptographers at Polygon Labs, Circle STARKs are a variant of the proofs widely used for Layer 2 scaling solutions, enabling Starknet to have faster finalization on both Layer 1 and Layer 2, according to the team.","Starknet was launched in alpha state on the Ethereum mainnet in November 2021. Since then, the StarkWare team has gradually open-sourced elements of the Starknet stack, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189798\/starkware-open-sources-latest-version-of-its-cairo-programming-language\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cairo 1.0<\/a> programming language, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/201471\/starkware-rolls-out-open-source-client-papyrus-for-starknet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Papyrus<\/a> client software and the Starknet <a href=\"https:\/\/starkware.co\/resource\/starknets-new-sequencer\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sequencer<\/a> (a component that orders and batches multiple off-chain transactions before submitting them to the Ethereum blockchain).","StarkWare previously open-sourced its existing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/208731\/starkware-open-sources-prover-technology-for-ethereum-layer-2-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stone<\/a> prover under the same license in August 2023 and eventually plans to fully open-source the Starknet stack.","The announcement comes just over a week after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278166\/starknet-token-strk\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Starknet\u2019s native token<\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> began trading on centralized exchanges and <span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/278196\/starknet-strk-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><!----> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">STRK<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -0.85%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span> airdrop claims for the token\u2019s distribution were opened on Feb. 20.<\/span>","The initial distribution involved 728 million STRK, accounting for 7.28% of the 10 billion total supply. Some 1.297 million wallets were deemed eligible for this distribution, based on a November snapshot that looked at the volume of transactions and interactions on the network. This eligibility extended to members of the Protocol Guild, EIP authors, solo stakers, and open-source developers from outside the web3 space.","However, the broader distribution plan faced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/277491\/core-contributors-investors-to-unlock-1-3-billion-of-starknet-tokens-just-two-months-after-it-becomes-tradable\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">criticism<\/a> from some because Starkware\u2019s core contributors and investors were set to receive over 1.3 billion STRK, or 13% of the total supply, on April 15 \u2014 less than two months after the token\u2019s launch.","On Feb. 20, StarkWare said it would be sticking to the plan, but just days later, it opted to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278714\/starkware-opts-to-gradually-release-strk-token-following-user-feedback\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">change<\/a> the release schedule following user feedback, dropping the portion of tokens initially unlocked from 13% to 0.64%, with a more gradual monthly unlock thereafter.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
