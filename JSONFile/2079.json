This comes amid concerns that Evergrande\u2019s struggles might impact the commercial paper market.","\u201CTether does not hold any commercial paper or other debt or securities issued by Evergrande and has never done so,\u201D said a spokesperson for Tether. \u201CAs we have indicated in our published statements and in our most recent assurance attestation with a reporting date of June 30, 2021, the vast majority of the commercial paper held by Tether is in A-2 and above rated issuers.\u201D","Tether is the issuer of the largest stablecoin in the crypto markets, USDT, which has a market cap of $68 billion. Backing the stablecoin is a variety of assets, mostly held in commercial paper and certificates of deposits along with treasury bills. (Other assets include loans, bonds, cash and cryptocurrencies).","Commercial paper and certificates of deposit make up nearly half of Tether\u2019s assets, some $30.8 billion on June 30, 2021 \u2014 the date specified in its most recent <a href=\"https:\/\/tether.to\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">assurance report<\/a>. According to a report from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FT<\/a> that came after its first breakdown in May, the sheer size of these holdings puts the firm in the same league as investment firms Vanguard and BlackRock.","Tether has provided little information on where this commercial paper is based. When asked by The Block if it held any Chinese commercial paper, the company said that it holds international commercial paper but would not disclose any futher details. It did, however, tell the FT that it has limits on regional exposure.","In China, there are serious concerns about Evergrande, which has run up a $300 billion debt and is struggling to pay interest. If the company were to collapse, it would have a huge impact on the financial system.&nbsp;","Evergrande has been trying to find ways to get out of its growing debt pile. The firm raised $8 billion by August, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-09-13\/what-is-china-evergrande-and-why-is-it-in-trouble-quicktake?sref=4ZGeBqkb\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bloomberg<\/a>, but it wasn\u2019t enough. On September 8, Fitch Ratings said that the company \"appears probable\" to default on its debt. Chinese authorities have since told banks that Evergrande won\u2019t pay interest on its loans next week, per <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-09-15\/china-tells-banks-evergrande-won-t-pay-interest-due-next-week\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bloomberg<\/a>.","\u201CThis $300bn debt monster is potentially China's Lehmann Brothers, trading in subterranean junk debt to Chinese (and global) counterparties (which may include Bitcoin via Tether) at spreads that imply insolvency,\u201D said Nucleus Wealth chief strategist David Llewellyn-Smith in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.livewiremarkets.com\/wires\/the-shortest-commodity-supercycle-ever\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent article<\/a>.","Evergrande is the biggest issuer of commercial paper in the Chinese real estate market, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/china-order-developers-disclose-commercial-paper-debt-every-month-sources-2021-07-16\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reuters<\/a>. At the end of 2020, it had $32 billion worth of commercial paper. The outlet estimated that the actual figure could be even higher, since it has other units, which also issue commercial paper.","\u201CThere is the stark reality that [a possible collapse] will have a huge impact on the commercial paper markets. Regardless of what commercial paper you hold, bonds and commercial paper would take a hit and some issuers may even fold,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adamscochran\/status\/1437614370553483267\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> Adam Cochran, partner at Cinneamhain Ventures.","As a result, even though Tether says it doesn\u2019t hold commercial paper issued by Evergrande, an upheaval in the commercial paper market could still have wider ramifications."],"hashtag":["TETHER"]}
