However, the nation's actual adoption of the cryptocurrency paints a mixed picture, according to Puell.","Puell pointed to comments from Signum Growth Capital CEO Angela Dalton during a <a href=\"https:\/\/ark-invest.com\/videos\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent<\/a> podcast with Ark, sharing her observations from a trip to the Central American nation. \u201CAwareness is high, yet usage is still low, \u2026 but there is a general sense of pride in the population that El Salvador is an early adopter of new technologies,\u201D Dalton said.&nbsp;","However, tourist destinations, such as Bitcoin Beach in El Zonte, are exceptions, showcasing a more widespread acceptance of the digital currency, Dalton added.","The Salvadorans' preference for the U.S. dollar and volatility in the price of bitcoin are the main reasons behind this cautious approach, Puell argued. Adopted as legal tender in 2001, the dollar has helped shield El Salvador from the inflationary woes that have plagued its neighbors, offering a more stable and trusted monetary system. Meanwhile, bitcoin is down over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">20%<\/a> since El Salvador <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/107699\/el-salvador-becomes-the-first-country-ever-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">passed<\/a> a bill to recognize bitcoin as legal tender, having previously doubled in the intervening period.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/prices\/btc-price\/embed\" title=\"BTC Price\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","In contrast, Argentina's relationship with bitcoin is evolving rapidly, Puell said, driven by economic challenges.

Milei's victory in the country\u2019s summer primaries on Aug. 13 not only signaled a potential shift in Argentina's economic policies but also triggered a sharp increase in bitcoin's price, soaring more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">20%<\/a> to 10.2 million Argentine pesos within 24 hours, Puell said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BTC\/ARS price chart.
