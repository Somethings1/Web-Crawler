The SEC has yet to approve a spot bitcoin fund.","\"We believe we have a responsibility to democratize investing,\" Fink said, commenting on broader growth in the ETF market and highlighting how gold funds had brought down the costs of transactions for the metal. \"Now, with crypto, the idea of democratizing that role...the cost right now to transact, it's quite expensive.
