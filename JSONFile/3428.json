However, it was withdrawn in January amid the U.S. Government shutdown. The partnership resubmitted the proposal in late January, only to receive a postponement notice on March 29. With the extension, the regulator then had 45 days to make a decision, drawing May 21 as the deadline for it to rule. Now, the hope that VanEck will receive a positive answer from the SEC this week is also dashed.&nbsp;<\/span>","In response to the repeated delays, VanEck digital asset strategy director Gabor Gurbacs <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gaborgurbacs\/status\/1130551647200075778?s=21\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said on Twitter<\/a> that \"we continue the hard work towards better-regulated, safer and more liquid digital assets markets. Bitcoin is too big to ignore.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meanwhile, the regulator had issued several extensions and rejections on ETF proposals, citing concerns that the proposals <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/winklevoss-brothers-bitcoin-etf-rejected-by-sec-for-second-time\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">did not satisfy SEC standards<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to prevent fraud and manipulation. <\/span>","In the announcement today, the SEC reiterates these concerns:","\u201CThe Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional analysis of the proposed rule change\u2019s consistency with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be \u201Cdesigned to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade,\u201D and \u201Cto protect investors and the public interest.\u201D","The SEC has sought public opinions on other ETF proposals before and it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/sec-commissioner-says-bitcoin-etf-will-be-approved-eventually\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has released some friendly signals<\/a> towards ETFs in the past.
