The fact remains that DeFi offers attractive risk-free arbitrage opportunities for leverage to amplify yield. But as institutional investors are mixing their CeFi and DeFi strategies in the current volatile market, how do we optimise for trade execution and best practices in risk management?&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The answer lies in prime services.
