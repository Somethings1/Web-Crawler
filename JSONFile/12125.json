Polygon Labs also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234063\/polygon-labs-sec-matic-security\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">responded<\/a> to the SEC's claims recently that MATIC is an unregistered security, saying that the token was \"developed outside the U.S., deployed outside the U.S. and focused to this day on the global community that supports the network.\"","Coinbase and Binance have been fighting with the SEC amid the lawsuits.
