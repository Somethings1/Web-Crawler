Users can create customized strategies that blend tokenized U.S. Treasury bills with a range of real-world assets to balance their yield and risk appetite in the first DeFi vault of its kind, AlloyX claimed.","AlloyX CEO Alexandre Liege highlighted a need for DeFi\u2019s composability and flexibility in real-world assets, referencing the 2022 crypto market crash.","\u201CAs we saw during the crypto market crash in 2022, investors wanted to exit positions from real-world lending pools. But it was hard to get out of these real-world loans with years left before maturity,\u201D Liege said in the statement. \u201CThe composability and flexibility that make DeFi valuable need to be available for real-world assets as well. To achieve this, we are building products to enable our community to invest and create real-world asset diversified baskets with automatic reinvestment, similar to what Yearn Finance created for digital assets.\u201D","\u201CWe\u2019ve seen demand from DAOs eager to allocate capital in the real-world assets space but are looking for flexible and liquid options that would work for them,\u201D added Credix Finance co-founder and Chief Growth Officer Chaim Finizola. \u201CWe\u2019re excited to see the AlloyX team launch the vault to give investors exposure to private credit while benefiting from the liquidity of U.S. T-Bills.\u201D&nbsp;","The AlloyX team says it's reached $5 million in total value locked and generated average yields of over 18% for assets held on the platform since its inception in 2021. AlloyX currently has nine integrated credit protocols, <a href=\"https:\/\/alloyx.xyz\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to its website.","AlloyX\u2019s first real-world assets vault is set to go live in early Q3, with plans to integrate with additional DeFi protocols and launch more investment vaults later this year.","Â© 2023 The Block.
