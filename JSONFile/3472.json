It added that it has rejected more than 90% of assets that apply to be listed on the platform.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The news comes as regulatory scrutiny ramps up with regards to staking, among other products. In February, rival exchange Kraken settled a case with the SEC over charges related to its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210332\/kraken-settles-sec-charges-over-its-staking-program\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">staking-as-a-service program,<\/a> leading it to shut down those operations in the U.S. and pay a $30 million fine. The regulator charged the company with selling unregistered securities because of the expectation of return from the staking-as-a-service program. Coinbase has publicly asserted that its own staking activity does not fall afoul of U.S. securities law.&nbsp;<\/span>","\"Staking is not a security under the U.S. Securities Act, nor under the <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/corpfin\/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/corpfin\/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Howey test<\/a>, which the SEC uses to determine whether an investment contract is a security,\" Grewal wrote in a post soon after the SEC's settlement with Kraken.&nbsp;","The move was a signal of more headaches for crypto companies in the U.S. as the SEC looked to further crack down on the passive investment offering after several high-profile failures left customers in court trying to reclaim their funds.","The notice also follows former Coinbase product manager Ishan Wahi pleading guilty to wire fraud-related criminal charges <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/209149\/former-coinbase-product-manager-pleads-guilty-to-criminal-charges-in-landmark-case\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in February<\/a>.&nbsp;","That guilty plea may moot a legal argument in separate civil charges brought by the SEC as to whether the nine tokens in question are securities; the SEC has argued that they are, but are not properly registered. Lawyers for Wahi filed a motion to dismiss that case. <span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Justice Department said Wahi tipped off his friend and brother about which tokens were going to be listed for trading on Coinbase \u2014 and in the process made over $1 million. The civil case remains ongoing, pending Wahi's expected sentencing in coming months.&nbsp;<\/span>","That case could leave the industry in the lurch. The judge would just need to decide that one of the tokens involved is a security, and the SEC could apply that to other market participants trading them, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/news\/post\/206002\/sec-case-against-former-coinbase-manager\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">experts have said<\/a>. In the lawyers' motion to dismiss the case, they argued that the tokens were not securities and warned of broader implications.","Coinbase had investigated Wahi's activity itself prior to the criminal and civil indictments, and is not accused of wrongdoing.&nbsp;","Nasdaq-listed Coinbase's stock dropped as much as 11.6% in after hours trading following the news, to trade at around $70.80.
