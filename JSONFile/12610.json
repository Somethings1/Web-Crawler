This was implemented following a governance approval from Arbitrum DAO","The Dencun upgrade introduced yesterday has equipped Layer 2 networks with a novel transaction type known as blobs. These blobs create a new method for chains to store information on Ethereum, moving away from the conventional \u201Ccalldata\u201D approach, and paving the way for significant reductions in transaction fees for Layer 2 networks including Arbitrum.","To integrate blobs, Layer 2 chains themselves must carry out software updates, and Arbitrum is the latest network to do so.","Layer 2 networks like Optimism, Base, and Starknet, which implemented blob transactions immediately after Dencun have already <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/282417\/ethereum-layer-2s-show-dramatic-drop-in-transaction-fees-after-dencun\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">seen significant reductions<\/a> in their average transaction fees.","For Arbitrum, Offchain Labs anticipates a reduction in the network\u2019s minimum base fee from 0.1 gwei to 0.01 gwei, marking a decrease by a factor of ten. Previously at $0.5, Arbitrum\u2019s average transaction fee could potentially decrease to about $0.05 following the Atlas upgrade.","\u201CWe are excited to see the Arbitrum DAO has voted to upgrade to ArbOS Atlas, which will bring significant benefits to the community in terms of improved transaction pricing,\u201D said Steven Goldfeder, CEO and co-founder of Offchain Labs.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/248265\/arbitrum-stylus-introduced-to-expand-language-support-for-ethereum-layer-2-dapps\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Offchain Labs<\/a>&nbsp;stated that several service providers, including Altlayer, Caldera, Conduit, and Gelato, which focus on Arbitrum, will assist in the transition for individual Orbit chains that use Arbitrum's software stack. Furthermore, Offchain Labs clarified that the ArbOS Atlas upgrade can be implemented by Orbit chains without the need for approval from the Arbitrum DAO governance process.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/tag\/arbitrum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arbitrum<\/a>&nbsp;stands as the most widely used Layer 2 network on Ethereum, based on the number of active wallets. It also boasts the highest total value locked among Layer 2 solutions, at nearly $3.5 billion, and supports popular decentralized apps such as Uniswap, GMX and Aave.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
