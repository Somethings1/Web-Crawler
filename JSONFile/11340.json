However, this decentralized structure has posed challenges in defending intellectual property rights, as demonstrated by the forced migration of the DAO's blog due to a \u201Cbaseless copyright claim,\u201D the post added.","\"The proposal was posted yesterday so it is only the first step,\" an Abracadabra DAO contributor known as Romy told The Block in an email. \"[I'm] very excited to see what the community contribution is and where this will go!\"","Magic Internet Money is a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by yield-bearing crypto assets with a market cap of around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/magic-internet-money\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$87 million<\/a>, according to CoinGecko data.

Every crucial decision will continue to be governed by the Spell token holders as it has always been.\u201D","\"Bear in mind this vote is not at all to centralize anything related to MIM or Abracadabra, but simply to have a point of contact (that judging from the options can be a lawyer, an association or any other legal entity) that can represent the DAO when it has to interface itself with centralized entities such as market makers, service providers, etc,\" Romy added. \"So there is no centralization of the DAO, its operations or treasury. All it will be is adding a point of contact that the DAO can use to interface with centralized players.\"","The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's win in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234019\/cftc-wins-ooki-dao-case-setting-precedent-that-daos-can-be-held-liable\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ooki DAO<\/a> case last month set a precedent that DAOs can be held liable, adding pressure to the need for legal frameworks, even if that means sacrificing at least some level of decentralization. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179986\/sushi-dao-agrees-to-implement-a-new-corporate-legal-structure\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sushi DAO<\/a> also agreed to implement a new corporate legal structure in October.","The proposed \u201Ctransition of power\u201D to the new entity will be determined through a multi-phase voting process involving Spell token holders.
