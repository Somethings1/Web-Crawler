The company is also considering how best to resolve claims and preserve the residual value of its assets, including its proprietary technology and tax assets.\"","\u201CThe Department of Financial Protection and Innovation is monitoring the situation closely to facilitate the safe and expeditious voluntary liquidation of Silvergate Bank,\u201D said California DFPI Commissioner Clothilde Hewlett. \u201CThe department is evaluating compliance with all financial laws, as well as safety and soundness obligations, and is working closely with relevant federal counterparts.\u201D Silvergate is California state-chartered bank.","The imminent demise of a prominent crypto-friendly bank attracted the Senate Banking Committee chairman's attention. \u201CAs the impact of FTX\u2019s collapse continues to ripple outward, today we are seeing what can happen when a bank is overreliant on a risky, volatile sector like cryptocurrencies,\u201D Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said in a statement.","\u201CI\u2019ve been concerned that when banks get involved with crypto, it spreads risk across the financial system and it will be taxpayers and consumers who pay the price,\" he added. That\u2019s why I am continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress and financial regulators to establish strong safeguards for our financial system from the risks of crypto.\u201D","One of his colleagues \u2014 and outspoken crypto skeptic \u2014 on the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was not surprised by Silvergate's liquidation. \"I warned of Silvergate's risky, if not illegal, activity \u2014 and identified severe due diligence failures,\" Warren said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/senwarren\/status\/1633611272372486144?s=46&amp;t=FYGzVq-s9dFHGSUdI1mdTQ\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweet<\/a>. \"Now, customers must be made whole and regulators should step up against crypto risk.\"","This sentiment was echoed by Alex Grieve, a vice president at the Washington, D.C.-based government affairs firm Tiger Hill Partners. \"While I can\u2019t speak to Silvergate\u2019s risk management practices or investment decisions, at a high level the continued consolidation of crypto banking services into an increasingly smaller pool of banks does not mean that the banking system is safer \u2014 it just increases concentration risk, Grieves said. \"Bank regulators should establish clear standards for banking crypto companies, rather than vague suggestions about safety and soundness.\"","Silvergate's liquidation raises serious questions about how the sector will be regulated in the near term and how crypto firms will access the banking system, said Alex More, partner at the law firm of Carrington, Coleman, Sloman and Blumenthal. \"On one hand, legitimate questions were raised by lawmakers and litigants about Silvergate's oversight of its banking relationships with crypto clients. To the extent Silvergate had problems with its internal controls that it could not resolve, maybe it's for the best that it's choosing to wind down,\" More said. \"On the other hand, the crypto community is already hindered by limited access to the U.S. banking system and Silvergate's demise only makes this problem worse.\"","Silvergate's collapse leaves a vacuum for crypto. <b data-stringify-type=\"bold\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"<\/b>There is nothing really stopping a bank from banking a crypto company but your bank regulator is going to come look at your books more frequently \u2014 let's say every six months instead of every 12, and that makes your life more difficult and drives up compliance costs,\u201D said Meltem Demirors, CoinShares chief strategy officer. \"So unless a crypto firm is a really big revenue generator, the juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze for many banks.\"","\"The combination of Silvergate's failure and the general chill on crypto banking services may create challenges for new start ups, unknown entities, and folks experimenting on the frontier of crypto,\" added Matt Hougan, Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer. \"In sum, this is not a good thing for crypto, but it is a good thing for crypto that it's happening now, and not four or five years ago, when crypto's connection to the traditional banking system was even narrower than it is today.\"","Added Laura Vidiella, LedgerPrime vice president of business development and strategy: \"Inevitably we need to team up with regulators and make it easier for other banks to bank crypto companies. It\u2019s been always the case but over the past couple years there\u2019s been so much cash flowing into the industry that we\u2019ve lost north a little bit.\"","The La Jolla, California-based bank has taken a beating recently over its ties to FTX and Alameda Research. Coinbase, Paxos, Circle and Gemini were among the companies that distanced themselves from the bank after it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/216548\/silvergates-network-unravels-leaving-crypto-industry-in-search-of-new-partners\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">warned<\/a> the SEC that it was \"less than well-capitalized\" and was \"re-evaluating its business\" and delayed the filing of its annual report.&nbsp;","Moody's last week <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/217061\/moodys-sees-significant-governance-deficiencies-in-silvergate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/217061\/moodys-sees-significant-governance-deficiencies-in-silvergate\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">downgraded<\/a>&nbsp; the company's long-term issuer rating for a second time and warned further rating cuts were on the table.
