On Wednesday, soon after the service went live, the team detected a problem with the server that award special souvenir tokens to users for trying out the platform. The team has said the bug is now fixed.","For now, the main functionality available via zkSync is token transfer.

For example, while optimistic rollup allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts in the same way as on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/85480\/bitcoin-ethereum-open-interest-ath\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum<\/a> base chain, it takes longer for users to withdraw funds from the side chain to base chain.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe will see very few solutions crystallizing as the winners for specific use cases,\u201D Gluchowski said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Matter Labs is also not the only startup working on zkRollup. Recently, another scaling solution research group, Loopring, has also seen substantial growth of its zkRollup-based decentralized exchange in recent months.
