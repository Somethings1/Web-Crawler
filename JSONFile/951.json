In an interview with The Block, Novogratz said that a recent influx of macro hedge funds and pensions into the digital asset market made the pipeline for its products stronger than it has been historically. In many periods of Galaxy's history, it has struggled to churn a profit and avoid lay-offs.&nbsp;","\"In January, I was cautious and frustrated,\" Novogratz, a former macro trader, said. \"But now I've been on so many freaking calls.

The company recently advised Blockfolio on its $150 million sale to FTX, and is said to be raising capital for a large mining company and is working on bringing in more talent as it adjusts for the upcoming&nbsp;exit&nbsp;of Ian Taylor, who has led the investment banking business since 2018.&nbsp;Taylor will rejoin Goldman Sachs later this year."],"hashtag":[]}
