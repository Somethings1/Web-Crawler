However, \"<\/span><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">this interpretation fails to distinguish between an investment in a fund, which would typically be a security under the jurisdiction of the SEC, and the trading activities of a fund, alleged here to be under the CFTC\u2019s jurisdiction,\" Pham said. \"The CFTC\u2019s approach may infringe upon the SEC\u2019s authority and undermine decades of robust investor protection laws by conflating a financial instrument with a financial activity, disrupting the foundations of securities markets.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Owning shares is not the same thing as trading derivatives,\" Pham added.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Over the past year, questions have frequently arisen about where the CFTC and SEC have authority over the crypto industry.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For example, the SEC and CFTC publicly have been divided on whether ether is a security or a commodity. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has skirted the question but has said many cryptocurrencies are securities. The CFTC has said, as recently as in its charges against KuCoin this week, that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284856\/cftc-ether-is-commodity-kucoin-lawsuit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ether<\/span><\/a> is a commodity.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/280952\/legislation-needed-to-regulate-crypto-cftc-chair-behnam-says-citing-cryptos-recent-uptick-in-value\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lawmakers<\/span><\/a> during a congressional hearing earlier this month that if the SEC <\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">were to constitute ether as a security, it would cause the CFTC's registrants who list ether as a futures contract into noncompliance with SEC rules, calling the situation \"critical.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
