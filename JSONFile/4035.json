Additionally, C\/C++ allow for more efficient memory management and faster execution of code, which are crucial for high-frequency trading.","According to Kariya, Solana's high-performance design combined with the experience Jump's engineers have in building highly efficient systems made Firedancer an attractive opportunity for the firm.","\"Most folks don't understand this about high-frequency trading firms, but they're fundamentally great at a couple of different things: one is high-performance computing at scale\u2026 and then, 'how do we optimize our environment overall such that we can we can get as much juice for the squeeze?' \u2014 and the confluence of those two factors made it such that Firedancer was a pretty awesome opportunity for us.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
