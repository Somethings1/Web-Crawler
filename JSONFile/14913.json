PalmDAO is calling on activists and artists to submit their work to the competition. From there, Tolokonnikova will select five finalists to be showcased during the event, where one winner will earn $1,000 and a special display of their work.","\u201CWe are so excited to have Nadya Tolokonnikova as our first curator, especially during International Women\u2019s Month and right after curating her collection for Sotheby\u2019s,\u201D Andrea Lerdo, executive director of the Palm Foundation, told CoinDesk.","Tolokonnikova has already made a name for herself in the digital art world on top of her career as an activist. This week, Tolokonnikova curated a Sotheby\u2019s auction in honor of International Women\u2019s Day, featuring works from feminist creators in the traditional and Web3 art worlds. In January, she collaborated with fellow activist artist Shepard Fairey to release an NFT collection to raise money for troops in Ukraine.","Read more: UnicornDAO Raises $4.5M to Empower Women and LGBTQ NFT Creators"],"entity":[{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"International Women\u2019s Month","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tolokonnikova","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4.5","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tolokonnikova","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Palm Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andrea Lerdo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"International Women\u2019s Day","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shepard Fairey","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pussy Riot\u2019s Nadya Tolokonnikova","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Palm","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"LGBTQ NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nadya Tolokonnikova","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Web3","Nadya Tolokonnikova","Pussy Riot","palm nft studio","NFTs"],"authors":["Cam Thompson"]}
