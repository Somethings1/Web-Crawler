According to the website, the final listing price will be $0.45.","People looking to buy the token need at least $100 in the accepted cryptocurrencies. These coins are bitcoin, ether, binance, tether, usd coin, binance usd, and dai. The sale supports transfers of these tokens on both the Ethereum ERC-20 and Binance Smart Chain networks. The project already stipulated a $500 minimum for participation in this round but was forced to lower the entry requirement amid complaints from prospective buyers.","The Sango project has sold 5.25% of the tokens, as of the time of publishing. &nbsp;This means the project has raised a little over $1 million in the first 24 hours of the public sale. The project plans to raise more than $1 billion from the token sale that will last for one year.","Sango Coins bought during this public sale phase have a one-year vesting requirement.
