Generated at random by an algorithm of Hobbs\u2019s design and rich with colorful curves and blocks, 999 of the pieces were minted at a price of 0.17 ether each (around $400 at the time). They now trade on the secondary market OpenSea for <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/assets\/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270\/78000313\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as much as 1,000 ether<\/a> (roughly $3.5 million) each.","A summer surge in the popularity of NFTs has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/116957\/nft-generative-art-future\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">been a boon<\/a> to the generative art community. According to The Block\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data dashboard<\/a>, $3.25 billion in NFTs exchanged hands on marketplaces like OpenSea in August \u2014 far in excess of the previous monthly high of $315 million in March.","For generative artists, who have toiled at the fringes of the art world for decades, the current state of the market is perhaps their first \u201Cmainstream breakthrough,\u201D according to Hobbs.","Fidenza #118","But can the good times last? Some <a href=\"https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/are-nfts-the-next-ico-fraud-r31g37gd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">have compared<\/a> the frenzied nature of speculation in the NFT space to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) bubble of 2017.","\u201CI would be totally amazed if NFTs went away,\u201D&nbsp; said Hobbs. \u201CI think they\u2019re here to stay, and I think they\u2019re going to play a huge role in the art world particularly for digital art for the foreseeable future.\u201D&nbsp;","Hobbs added, however, that boom and bust cycles occur in many markets. \u201CI think we\u2019ve certainly seen a lot of booming so it would only be natural to expect some sort of equivalent bust at some point,\u201D he said.","Hobbs\u2019s confidence stems in part from his belief that NFTs have already reached a \u201Ccritical mass of social acceptance,\u201D he said. \u201CAs long as everybody agrees that owning an NFT carries some significance, then it does.\u201D","The Art Blocks model offers some reassurance to collectors in this regard. The platform, which has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/115199\/squiggles-art-blocks-nft-frenzy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">swept up a significant chunk<\/a> of the cash flowing into NFTs over the summer, stores the script that is used to generate its artists\u2019 work on the blockchain. This allows owners to verify that the pieces they own originated from the code written by the artist.","\u201CSo you\u2019re essentially guaranteed that all that output is from one fully generative program. There was nothing done manually, there was no curation, no hand assembling,\u201D said Hobbs.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
