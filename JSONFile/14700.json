Earn was offered to customers of the Gemini crypto exchange, but Genesis supplied the financial infrastructure that ran the program.

Genesis owes over $3 billion to its top 50 creditors overall.","That money, under DCG\u2019s proposed repayment plan, would be paid across two tranches and seven years, and would eventually make Gemini Earn users \"nearly whole,\" according to DCG's lawyers.","Gemini\u2019s lawyers, however, challenged that assertion, alleging DCG\u2019s proposal would allow the firm to pay \u201Cpar\u201D recoveries through \u201Cinadequate\u201D below-market loans.","\u201CReceiving a fractional share of interest and principal payments over seven years from an incredibly risky counterparty \u2026 is not even remotely equivalent to receiving the actual cash and digital assets owed today by Genesis to the Gemini Lenders,\u201D Gemini\u2019s lawyers said in the filing.","They added: \u201CDCG\u2019s [proposal] is markedly parallel to \u2026 an attempt to satisfy its significant obligations through the issuance of \u2018I.O.U.s\u2019 instead of paying any real cash and digital assets.\u201D","In addition, the lawyers complained more broadly about DCG\u2019s efforts to \"wear \u2026 down\" Genesis' creditors \"in the hopes that they [would] become desperate enough to take a significant haircut just to move on.\"","Gemini and DCG have feuded for months over Genesis' debts to Gemini.
