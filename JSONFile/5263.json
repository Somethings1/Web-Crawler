Meanwhile, the percentage of buy ratings among analysts has declined from 75% in May 2021 to just 58% as of the time of writing.&nbsp;","Coinbase stock was trading at $58.83 \u2014 down more than 70% year-to-date.&nbsp;","","","Coinbase \u2014 which makes the vast majority of its revenues from cryptocurrency trading fees \u2014 faces a number of headwinds in what has been described as a new \"Crypto Winter.\" Declining crypto prices and a retreat of retail market participants have translated into a drop in users for the exchange operator.&nbsp;","In its most recent quarterly earnings report, the firm said that it \"believe(s) these market conditions are not permanent\" and remains focused on the long-term.","Analysts have not been mollified by Coinbase's optimism, however, given tough market conditions that have only soured due to the fallout from the meltdown of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and the bankruptcy proceedings of brokerage and financial services rivals including Voyager and Celsius.&nbsp;","The firm also faces new regulatory headwinds, with Bloomberg <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/159593\/the-sec-is-investigating-coinbase-over-its-coin-listings-bloomberg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reporting<\/a> on Monday that the firm is in the midst of an ongoing probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
