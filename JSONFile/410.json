It is inviting proposals from potential suppliers until January 31 and looking to start a contract on February 17.","Blockchain analytics firms Chainalysis, Elliptic and CipherTrace could be some of the potential suppliers as these firms help track crypto transactions. U.K.-based Elliptic, for instance, recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/47675\/blockchain-analytics-firm-elliptic-finds-over-400m-xrp-tied-to-illegal-activities\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">found<\/a> over $400 million worth of XRP transactions related to illegal activities such as scams and Ponzi schemes.","\u201CMany of these crypto-asset transactions are recorded publicly in a ledger known as a blockchain. Whilst the transactions are typically public, the participants undertaking them are not,\u201D HMRC was quoted as saying in Monday\u2019s report.","The tax agency is, therefore, seeking the \u201Cprovision of a tool that will support intelligence-gathering methods to identify and cluster crypto-asset transactions into linked transactions and identify those linked to crypto-asset service providers.\u201D","Last August, HMRC was also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/34934\/british-tax-agency-demands-customer-information-from-exchanges-including-coinbase\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">demanding<\/a> customer and transaction information from crypto exchanges Coinbase, eToro, and CEX.IO.
