Yet, murky origins and numerous public comments ensure that it is still an opaque question in the case of Ripple and XRP.","Despite the legal uncertainty around XRP, the large investment firm Grayscale offers its customers&nbsp;the ability to gain exposure to the price movement of the asset through <a href=\"https:\/\/grayscale.co\/xrp-investment-trust\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">XRP Investment Trust<\/a>, which currently has&nbsp;$4.6M in assets under management.&nbsp;R3 recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.r3.com\/news\/r3-launches-universal-corda-settler-application\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched Corda Settler<\/a>, an open source application that allows Corda users to settle using any payment method, with XRP&nbsp;being the first payment rail.

Our exploration today is simple. We assess whether XRP could qualify as a security based on what Ripple executives have said publicly in the past. This piece can be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/ripples-changing-narrative-around-the-creation-of-xrp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">our recent exploration<\/a> of Ripple's evolving narrative around the genesis of XRP.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">William Hinman, Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, said <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/speech-hinman-061418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in a speech in June<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;that Ethereum is a sufficiently decentralized network. As a result, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. There was a considerable amount of confusion at that time about what \u2018sufficiently decentralized\u2019 means in the eyes of the SEC.<\/span>","Recently, however, the SEC had even more to say about the concept of decentralized currencies.","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhen a store of value becomes truly decentralized - not one person or group of people control its supply or control trading or they have access to asymmetric information - we have said that that\u2019s distributed and therefore you don\u2019t have to re-register those transactions,\" <\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said&nbsp;SEC Chairman Jay Clayton at Consensus Invest in late November.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Clayton also said that tokens and their networks can 1) evolve from one use to another, 2) become more or less decentralized over time and 3) go from being security offerings to not being security offerings. It\u2019s therefore possible that the sale of a token was a securities offering at the time of initial sale but has transformed into a commodity by becoming \u2018sufficiently decentralized.\u2019<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When asked whether XRP was a security, Clayton didn\u2019t respond directly. He did, however follow up with a statement that the SEC is open to projects of all kinds and that his door was always open. He continued by saying that the issues around whether a specific token is a security often require a lot of information in order to get to a definitive position.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s important to point out that the SEC does not make laws but rather gives guidance and enforces laws. Any of the SEC\u2019s Commissioners and lawyers cannot say anything that\u2019s binding. In fact, the SEC can take an enforcement action and then lose in court, which happens on a somewhat regular basis.&nbsp;<\/span>","So what are the rules of thumb in analyzing tokens as securities? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/speech-hinman-061418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Hinman<\/a>, we need to consider the growth of a functional network.","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CHas the promoter raised an amount of funds in excess of what may be needed to establish a functional network, and, if so, has it indicated how those funds may be used to support the value of the tokens or to increase the value of the enterprise?

Ripple Labs is and will continue to be a regular seller of XRP, while according to Ripple management, the XRP Ledger is already a functional and decentralized network (this statement has been highly <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/petertodd\/ripple-consensus-analysis-paper\/blob\/master\/paper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">contested by industry experts as well<\/a>).

Ripple can only materialize that value for its shareholders if that value and liquidity are preserved over the next several years. Sure, Ripple makes money by selling software to banks. But how many banks do you think Ripple would have to close to make six hundred million dollars in license\/support fees?

At that point, Ripple committed to placing 55 billion XRP in an escrow account to establish 55 contracts of 1 billion XRP each that will expire on the first day of every month from months 0 to 54. As each contract expires, the XRP becomes available for Ripple\u2019s use. If Ripple wants to maximize their revenues from selling the XRP that it has available, it\u2019s in their best interest to try to increase the price of XRP.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As seen in the chart below, over the past 2 years, Ripple Labs has sold over $617 million XRP in the public markets and to private institutions<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When studying XRP's history and its relationship to Ripple Labs from genesis through today, it\u2019s nearly impossible to make the argument that XRP is truly decentralized. It is clear from their own statements and actions that a group of people, in this case Ripple Labs, clearly control XRP supply and trading, while also being in possession of asymmetric information about current and future prospects for usage of the XRP token.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple is already a functional network, yet they continue to sell XRP in quantities significantly exceeding that which was necessary to establish a functional network. XRP was created as an anti-sybil mechanism for the Ripple protocol with the intention to continuously sell XRP to fund operations, repay investors, and pay employees. As demonstrated by their own comments, Ripple is clearly incentivized to increase the value of XRP and therefore XRP holders\u2019 investments. This is a necessity because Ripple's XRP holdings are held in escrow, and the sale of XRP is their main source of revenue.<\/span>","The Block is not in a position to determine whether XRP is or is not a security, but we present the relevant information to help inform the discussion. At the current moment, the matter of whether XRP is a security is being discussed in court. Ripple is facing a class action lawsuit&nbsp;alleging that the XRP token is a security issued by Ripple.

If approved, the long controversy will likely be decided in federal court down the line.
