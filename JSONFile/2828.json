The proposal sets the maximum inflation of the Hub\u2019s native token, Atom, at 10%.<\/span>","The fork will result in a new network, AtomOne, with the associated token, ATOM1. The launch plans include rewarding the genesis supply to existing ATOM holders, with more rewards to those who opposed the proposal 848. Meanwhile those who voted yes to the proposal will be \u201Cslashed\u201D and they may receive fewer tokens.","Roughly 10% will be pre-mined for various purposes, as stated in a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/atomone-hub\/genesis\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">document<\/a> by Kwon. The Interchain Foundation will not be included in the airdrop.","The controversial proposal to limit Atom\u2019s inflation rate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264683\/cosmos-community-approves-capping-atom-inflation-rate-at-10?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">passed<\/a> narrowly yesterday with 41.1% support against 38.5% opposition, in the most popular vote in the Cosmos ecosystem\u2019s history. Advocates argued that Atom\u2019s inflation was higher than necessary for maintaining security and that validators could remain profitable with a 10% inflation rate.","Kwon, who developed the Cosmos network\u2019s Tendermint consensus algorithm and co-founded the Hub, voiced opposition to this decision due to his concerns about the change's impact on network security. Unwilling to accept the vote\u2019s outcome, he is now determined to split the Cosmos Hub despite many community members <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cosmonaut_joon\/status\/1728585409461199289\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">requesting<\/a> him not to do so. The Hub serves as the central blockchain of the Cosmos ecosystem, with Atom being integral for staking, governance, and transaction fees.","The forked network will use the same underlying software of the existing Cosmos Hub, known as Gaia, with the chain ID \u201Ccosmoshub4,\u201D maintaining key features such as IBC and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/219219\/cosmos-hub-releases-replicated-security\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interchain security<\/a>. It will preserve the original maximum inflation rate of 20% to reward validators and stakers adequately. Additionally, Kwon has proposed a separate fee token, Photon (phATOM1), to operate in conjunction with ATOM1.&nbsp;","Kwon said the new token aims to replace the original design of the Hub with changed governance mechanisms, such as altering the quorum threshold for passing governance decisions from less than 50% on the Hub to two-thirds on the new network. Overall the forked Hub would have a simplistic design, focusing on security.","This fork will be separate from Kwon\u2019s other Layer 1 blockchain project in development named Gno.Land.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
