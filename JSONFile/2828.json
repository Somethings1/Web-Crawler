The drop in difficulty was expected after bitcoin\u2019s halving last week, which saw mining reward get cut from 12.5 bitcoins to 6.25 bitcoins.","The latest difficulty drop is the sixteenth largest drop in bitcoin's history. The next difficulty adjustment is likely to take place in about 15 days from now and it may decline further.","","","Another key metric of bitcoin\u2019s mining activity - hashrate, or bitcoin network\u2019s processing power - is also down by 25%. This indicates that miners with old-generation machines have unplugged post the halving.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CMiners are adjusting to the new block rewards post-halving, and we have seen a drop of bitcoin hashrate from around 125 EH\/s [exahash per second] pre-halving to around 90 EH\/s now. Most of the hashrate drop has been from older-generation machines from China, however, miners all over the globe have been affected,\u201D Thomas Heller, global business director at F2Pool, told The Block.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n","","Poolin's vice president Alejandro De La Torre concurred. He told The Block that around 30% of miners have shut off their machines. Before the halving, these miners were \"just slightly profitable,\" but now they have had to shut down due to the 50% reduction of the mining reward.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nHowever, as the hydro season in China is expected to begin around May 25, many of these offline machines may get back online due to cheaper electricity prices, said Heller and De La Torre. It rains heavily in China during the hydro season (May to October) and hydroelectricity gets cheaper.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nDe La Torre said the \"wet season\" in China's Sichauan province will \"undoubtedly push up the hashrate in the short to mid term\" as mining farm operators flock to this region in the upcoming months.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CAssuming the bitcoin price remains stable, we are expecting the network hashrate to increase in the following weeks,\u201D said Heller."],"hashtag":["BITCOIN"]}
