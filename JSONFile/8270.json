He started developing what would become Teku, a staking client on the Ethereum network initially known as Artemis. Edgington sat down with The Block ahead of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/category\/the-merge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Merge<\/a> to discuss his career, how he found crypto and his role ahead of the upgrade.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2016, Edgington was working for Hitachi Europe, where he had worked since 1998.
