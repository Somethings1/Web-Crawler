Peregrine also brought a set of improvements that enhance Casper\u2019s flexibility, especially for DeFi projects to offer a better user experience.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The anticipated Juliet upgrade for Casper is all about security and efficiency and it will achieve that through establishing a new networking layer equipped with back-pressure mechanisms which will improve Casper\u2019s ability to withstand periods of intense traffic.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The new networking layer is designed to enhance the security of Casper, aiming to safeguard the network against potential threats and attacks without sacrificing efficiency.&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The innovative aspect of the Juliet networking layer is its robust defense mechanism against attacks. Essentially, any attempt to DDoS a Casper node or the Casper network will result in the attacking node running out of memory.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Beyond security, Juliet's innovative approach to data handling is worth mentioning. The upgrade allows for multiple data streams to be managed concurrently, enabling Casper to handle a higher volume of transactions and interactions more easily and without slowing down or becoming congested.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Juliet offers customizable settings for data transmission, allowing builders and users to tailor the network's performance to their specific needs.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Following Juliet, Casper will roll out Condor, the final upgrade in Casper\u2019s protocol roadmap to Casper 2.0. After two years of public development, Condor will introduce game-changing features, making Casper feature-complete.&nbsp; Casper introduces the ability for nodes to support multiple consensus mechanisms, as it continues to support the Highway protocol while integrating the new Zug consensus mechanism. Validators will have the capability to switch between these mechanisms based on a collective vote, setting the stage for future VM iterations and enabling transitions to alternative versions of the Casper VM.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Additionally, these updates facilitate the creation of private sidechains, broadening Casper's adaptability and enabling cross-chain interactions.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another highlight of Condor is its approach to transaction costs., Casper will offer 100% gas refunds, and potentially, transactions will not require any gas fees.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Condor upgrade enhances unforgeable references (URefs), essentially unique identifiers that boost both security and user control. With this update, users gain the ability to specify who can access certain data or functions through whitelisting, set expiration dates for these permissions, and manage sharing settings more intuitively.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Everything an account can currently do on Casper, such as storing data, managing associated keys, and governance functionalities, will also be possible for contracts. The unification allows contracts to pay for transactions, stake in the network, and even receive multi-signature upgrades for enhanced governance.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That means builders can implement account abstraction that can offer a \"keyless\" solution to Web2 users, meaning using their social account, users can securely log in to DApps or recover their wallets.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Additionally, smart contracts will be able to self-fund transactions and participate in network staking. <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This means DApps are more autonomous, efficient, and integrated into the Casper ecosystem's economic model.&nbsp;<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Casper expanded liquidity in February by making cspr accessible to over 173 countries through its partnership with Alchemy Pay.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Unique for its foundational focus on upgradability and modularity, the Casper blockchain has already utilized its foundational aspect. The Peregrine upgrade, the second of the four planned protocol upgrades, was successfully deployed on the Casper mainnet on February 8th, 2024, and demonstrated the chain's adaptability alongside introducing several core improvements that made it DeFi-ready.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by Casper and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
