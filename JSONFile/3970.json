This indicator measures the profitability of bitcoin trades with coins held for less than 155 days.","\"A declining STH-SOPR during a price correction suggests many short-term holders may panic-sell their bitcoin, contributing to the overall drop in prices. This behavior can lead to a self-reinforcing cycle of declining prices,\" CryptoQuant Analyst Adam Mourad told The Block.","The analyst charted the STH-SOPR since the digital asset's price spiked after Grayscale's legal win against the SEC. The price appreciation saw the STH-SOPR stabilize at the 1 mark. If the chart indicator stabilizes at 1, short-term holder bitcoins can be sold without gain or loss.","&nbsp;\"The development indicates short-term holders sold their bitcoin at a price that allows them to exit without making a profit or incurring a loss, essentially at a break-even point,\" Mourad added.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_positive\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      +0.68%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> has been caught in a tight range between $25,800 and $26,000 over the past 24 hours, remaining stuck in a lower price bracket since it crashed two weeks ago.
