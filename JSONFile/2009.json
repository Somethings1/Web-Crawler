Major asset managers are filing for Ethereum ETFs as the SEC punts on yet another decision. Terraform Labs, known for creating the Terra\/Luna ecosystem, made its first major acquisition post Do Kwon's exit, while Jump Trading continued its shift away from crypto by spinning off Wormhole. Finally, South Korea's pension fund bought millions of Coinbase shares as Ordinal-like tokens made a splash on Polygon.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Let's take a closer look at each story in this recap.&nbsp;<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263299\/blackrock-ethereum-etf-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlackRock<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263626\/fidelity-files-for-spot-ethereum-etf-says-approval-would-be-major-win-for-us-investors\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fidelity<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, two major asset management firms, have both filed with the SEC for spot Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust aims to reflect Ethereum's price, with Coinbase as its custodian. Fidelity's filing emphasized the importance of such ETFs for U.S. investor protection, claiming investors are seeking riskier ways to get exposure.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meanwhile, the SEC has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263544\/sec-delays-hashdex-nasdaq-ethereum-etf-application-to-next-year\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">delayed<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> its decision on the Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF, which would include both spot ether and futures, until January 2024. The SEC's delay, citing the need for more time to consider the proposal and related issues, also affected a decision regarding a Hashdex bitcoin futures ETF application.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Terraform Labs, known for developing the Terra blockchain, has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/262739\/terraform-labs-acquires-cross-chain-data-provider-as-it-pursues-post-kwon-plans#:~:text=,is%20now%20coming%20into%20focus\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acquired<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Pulsar Finance, a cross-chain portfolio management and analytics startup.

This purchase, reported in the NPS' latest holdings report, marks the first time the pension fund, which had assets under management of $755 billion as of June, has included a crypto-related security in its investment portfolio.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Notably, the NPS has a policy against directly investing in crypto assets, though it had previously indicated a potential interest in investing in crypto exchanges.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jump Trading has announced the transformation of its cross-chain protocol Wormhole into an independent business entity. This strategic move occurs amidst a significant downsizing of Jump Crypto, the firm's cryptocurrency division, which has seen a 50% reduction in staff from its peak of 150 in 2022. This shift in focus and resources comes after Jump Trading scaled back its crypto market activities due to U.S. regulatory uncertainties and ended its long-standing partnership with Robinhood.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Notably, Jump Crypto had swiftly intervened to restore $323 million worth of ETH lost in a major hack on Wormhole in early 2022, which marked one of the largest exploits in decentralized finance history.
