Open interest on the CME continues to push toward new highs at 105,000 BTC ($3.7 billion). Growth from futures-based ETFs also experienced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/261683\/crypto-funds-six-week-streak-ether-inflows\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">significant weekly inflows<\/a> as ProShares' BITO saw its third strongest weekly bitcoin inflow since November 2021.","Front-month premiums for both bitcoin and ether climbed over the past week, sitting at 16% annualized. Farther-dated expiries are also experiencing bullish flows, with December expiries currently trading at a 1% premium to November, Lunde and Helseth added.","Additionally, bitcoin and ether CME premiums <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/260479\/bearish-stance-on-ether-is-gone\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">remained<\/a> on par for the second week running, eliminating a prior discrepancy as institutional traders are no longer positioned for further ether weakness, the analysts noted.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CME front-month premiums and ProShares net ETF flows.

However, despite the trend, implied volatility remains below its three-year average.","Offshore perpetual swap funding rates remained neutral since bitcoin's rally to $35,000, a shift from the previously bearish sentiment. Stability in open interest also signaled a collective wariness of over-leverage among traders, Lunde and Helseth said, in a crypto trading landscape recently dominated by reaction to news, especially spot bitcoin ETFs.","Â© 2023 The Block.
