As a leader in digital asset accounting infrastructure, Ledgible teamed up with leaders in digital asset accounting, FORVIS, to address some of the challenges surrounding crypto tax planning and strategy in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ledgible.io\/news\/challenges-facing-consumers-small-businesses-in-crypto\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent release<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the core of the challenges facing digital asset taxation are three key fields: data, evolution, and regulation.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The core challenge of digital asset taxation and accounting starts with data. Just like a business starts with transaction data to compile financial statements, a similar approach must be taken to compile the overall economic impact of crypto transactions. In many ways, the decentralized nature of crypto means that compiling accurate data is a challenge \u2013 but in others, the immutable records of blockchains aid in the process.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the core, what enterprises and businesses need are experts in data aggregation and normalization; able to ingest and normalize cryptocurrency data from a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ledgible.io\/ask-yourself-these-7-questions-before-running-a-node\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">variety of sources<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, DeFI, NFT, blockchain, or otherwise.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This challenge is at the core of the value proposition Ledgible provides to users.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another challenge with crypto taxation is the constantly evolving and complex nature of underlying digital asset technologies, which makes it difficult for CPAs and accounting professionals to keep up with the latest developments and fully comprehend the information they are handling. Because of the pace of change in the industry, it has been said that spending one year devoted to crypto is like 10 years outside of crypto. Not every blockchain works the same, and not every application on the blockchain works the same.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For example, holders of the ATOM token can stake their ATOM and in exchange for securing the COSMOS blockchain, they receive ATOM tokens as a reward. Once ATOM tokens are staked, they are locked up and cannot be traded until unstaked. Contrast that with staking Ethereum (ETH) through Lido; holders of the ETH token can stake their ETH and in exchange for securing the ETH blockchain, they receive ETH tokens <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ledgible.io\/10-questions-every-yield-farmer-needs-to-answer-for-tax-season\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as a reward<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. However, with Lido, ETH stakers can choose to receive stETH, a liquid derivative of ETH. This liquid derivative allows stakers of ETH to effectively trade their ETH while it is locked up. Catch all that? Now imagine the data and the data format needed for CPAs to help their clients report this information. It\u2019s complex, to say the least.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This complexity necessitates experts solely focused on this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ledgible.io\/an-overview-of-tax-strategies-for-crypto-investors-in-2023\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">complex calculation<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">,&nbsp; something most enterprises and institutions are not adept at handling internally.
