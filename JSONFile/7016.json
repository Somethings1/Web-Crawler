As the ecosystem evolves, it is essential to appropriately define and value blockchains and tokens. Because the asset class is young, there are no congruent strategies across asset managers. However, this wide range of valuation techniques presents exceptional opportunities for alpha generation and is, we believe, what makes digital assets one of the most attractive investable asset classes.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arca\u2019s <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Valuing Digital Assets<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> webinar series demystifies the digital asset landscape to highlight how institutional investors can apply traditional valuation methods to tokens and when unique approaches are necessary.

Instead, various risk, reward, and value accrual characteristics exist within different pockets of the market. To analyze these variables, we compare digital assets to fixed income, considering the issuing body and the varying asset functionalities. This is a crucial aspect of valuation in traditional and digital assets; just as investors use specific considerations to value stocks in differing verticals, the distinct objectives of each token require unique valuation methods.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While many similarities exist between digital assets and traditional financial vehicles, digital assets have distinct properties. For example, pass-through tokens combine payments, rewards, and utility. This novel blend of properties requires an integrated assessment of token and project objectives for optimal valuation outcomes. In addition, traditional financial vehicles are subject to regulatory oversight and protections that many digital assets lack.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In our upcoming second installment to this valuation series, we will dive into valuation methods for the DeFi sector and the impacts of economic conditions on token incentive models.
