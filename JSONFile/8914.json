Gauntlet\u2019s insolvency fund <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x7667095Caa12b79fCa489ff6E2198Ca01fDAe057\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">holds<\/a> 4,923 staked Aave tokens, which is currently worth $283,000. The DeFi lender's treasury itself is worth $165 million, based on the last financial <a href=\"https:\/\/llama.xyz\/reports\/aave\/october-2022-financials.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a> by Llama, and can be used to cover the excess debt, the proposal added.","Aave racked up bad debt due to a publicized short on Curve DAO (CRV) tokens. One trader borrowed 92 million CRV worth $57 million on the DeFi lending platform and proceeded to sell them continuously, causing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189028\/curve-dao-token-plunges-14-under-heavy-short-selling-pressure\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an initial decline<\/a> in the CRV price as the token dipped to a two-year low of $0.40. The short seller, however, suffered a squeeze as the CRV token <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189167\/curve-token-jumps-50-amid-squeeze-on-big-short-position\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">price rallied above $0.60<\/a>.","This squeeze eventually liquidated the short seller\u2019s debt position on Aave, and the liquidations left the DeFi protocol with debt amounting to $1.6 million.","The proposal stated that the debt coverage process could help to optimize the Aave DAO treasury. Aave\u2019s treasury holds \u201Ca large number of low-value long tail assets,\u201D the proposal stated. Gauntlet and Llama said the assets may be used to recapitalize Aave\u2019s system and make the CRV market whole in the process.","The Aave DAO community will discuss the proposal in the coming days. Gauntlet and Llama will provide details on how the debt coverage process will unfold if the DAO favors the proposal.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
