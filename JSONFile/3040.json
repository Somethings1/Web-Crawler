Plaintiff also makes claims for unjust enrichment and alleged violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act.","The opinion is a mixed bag \u2014 it dismisses some of the claims against some of the parties in the lawsuit and keeps a couple of them alive. (It also uses lots of contractions, which I\u2019m a big fan of in judicial opinions \u2014 why not make \u2019em readable? \u2014 but which is a source of some disagreement among lawyers).","So, the plaintiff sued a company called Blackhack for allegedly failing to deliver mining equipment. Blackhawk responded by saying, whelp, it may be true that you didn\u2019t get your equipment or that we got paid, but you didn\u2019t have a contract with us \u2014 it was with a company called Coin Miner. As a result it said that the Court should dismiss the breach of contract claim against it.","One of the things you learn about in law school is something called Principal\/Agent law. The basic idea is that you can act on behalf of someone else and even bind them to contractual agreements if you have the actual or apparent authority to do so. Here, the court says that the allegations in the lawsuit were solid enough that the breach of contract claim could proceed on the theory that Coin Miner was acting as an agent of Blackhawk. If it later turns out from the evidence that there\u2019s no agency relationship, the court can then dismiss the case.","(This is one of the nuances that exists in federal court in the US, by the way \u2014 a lawsuit will survive a motion to dismiss if the allegations state a claim under the law and give the other side enough details to \u201Cpresent a story that holds together[.]\u201D That\u2019s a lay explanation and an over-simplification but the general gist is right.)","The Court also rejected an argument that the defendant didn\u2019t plead an unjust enrichment allegation well enough to survive a motion to dismiss. Unjust enrichment is what\u2019s known as an equitable cause of action, as opposed to one arising at law like a breach of contract claim. There are some FASCINATING historical reasons for this, but I\u2019ll short circuit that and tell you that as a practical matter unjust enrichment claims are often added to lawsuits as an alternative to a breach of contract claim. You don\u2019t have to show a contract, just that Plaintiff conferred a benefit upon the Defendant, that Defendant knew it and appreciate it and that it would be unfair under the circumstances to let the plaintiff keep it without paying. Here, the defendant allegedly got $400,000 from the plaintiff for the equipment that it ordered and the court said, look, at the very least it\u2019s premature to dismiss the case gien that so I\u2019ll let the case proceed for now.","Anyhoo \u2014 honestly, pretty standard stuff as lawsuits and judicial opinions go. What I was kinda hoping for from this opinion was something interesting on damages \u2014 like what\u2019s the measure of damages for late delay or non-delivery of mining equipment. Do you get to claim lost profits from the lack of ability to mine? And if so, how would you go about making an arguing that such losses were provable, and non-speculative? &nbsp;No such precedent now, but this case isn\u2019t dead yet, so maybe we\u2019ll see some interesting precedent in the future from this one in the future.","<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Crypto Caselaw Minute is provided for educational purposes only by Stephen Palley (@stephendpalley) and Nelson Rosario (@nelsonmrosario). &nbsp;These summaries are not legal advice.
