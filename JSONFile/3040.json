You can't do that with food processing industries, you can't do it with steel, you can't do it with most manufacturing \u2014 it's a very unique, symbiotic relationship that bitcoin mining and the power industry can have in this regard.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> The impact of weather was on display this week with high temperatures in Texas leading to record-breaking usage of power.&nbsp;<\/span>","As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/151084\/bitcoin-miners-in-texas-have-been-powering-down-amid-heatwave-and-record-electricity-demand\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> by The Block, many Bitcoin miners in the state have set agreements with ERCOT to power down at peak energy demand times.
