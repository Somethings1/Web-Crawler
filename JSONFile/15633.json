But the big surprise was the fast uptake of Casey Rodarmor's new Runes protocol, his second big hit on the original blockchain in two years. Now, it looks like the initial fee bonanza might be fading, and the question is whether Runes transactions will provide a sustainable source of ongoing revenue for miners, especially now that the block rewards have been cut in half. We've got the recap.","ALSO:","This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time.

Bitcoin's once-every-four-years \"halving\" was supposed to bring a steep cut in revenue for crypto miners, since their rewards for new data blocks would drop by 50%. Instead, the simultaneous launch of Casey Rodarmor's new Runes protocol \u2013 for minting digital tokens on top of the oldest and largest blockchain \u2013 proved so popular that it caused massive network congestion, sending transaction fees to record levels and showering Bitcoin miners with a windfall like never before. On a halving watch party hosted by Tone Vays, longtime Bitcoin experts expressed astonishment at transaction fees surpassing $2 million in certain blocks, versus a more typical level of less than $100,000. The main questions now are whether the Runes fever will last, and if so how Bitcoin will adapt. BitDigest newsletter circulated a chart (above) showing a steep drop-off in the fees as the initial post-Runes launch subsided. But the community discussion immediately turned to whether the extra traffic might prompt developers to accelerate their quest to build out and improve Bitcoin layer-2 networks. On Monday, one of the more prominent projects, Stacks, rolled out its much-anticipated \"Nakamoto\" upgrade, tipped to dramatically increase the speed. \"Anything that causes fee rates to spike will probably drive people to seek out other solutions,\" Bitcoin Core developer Ava Chow said in an interview with CoinDesk's Daniel Kuhn. Rodarmor, who created the Ordinals protocol for \"Bitcoin NFTs\" last year, shaking up the blockchain's conservative culture, has famously said that the Runes protocol was nothing more than a way of launching \"sh!tcoins\" on Bitcoin \u2013 a dicey proposition given how anti-altcoin longtime bitcoiners tend to be. There's now speculation that top Ordinals collections might move to airdrop runes, another practice imported from other blockchains. The Bitcoin NFT project Runestones, led by the pseudonymous developer Leonidas, is reportedly airdropping DOG coins to holders of its inscriptions. In the meantime some of the newly minted runes are drawing jaw-dislodging valuations as they get listed on various crypto exchanges. Bitcoin.com estimated that a rune called \"Z\u2022Z\u2022Z\u2022Z\u2022Z\u2022FEHU\u2022Z\u2022Z\u2022Z\u2022Z\u2022Z,\" or \"Z\u2022FEHU\" for short, already has a fully diluted valuation over $2 billion. (By the way, to type that dot in the middle of the trading ticker, a Runes convention, type option-8 on a Mac keyboard. I had to ask our markets editor how to do it. At this rate, it might be something we all need to learn.)","CELO'S CHOICE. The main developer behind layer-1 blockchain Celo, after a months-long search for a technology provider for its migration to become a layer-2 network atop Ethereum, chose to recommend Optimism's OP Stack. Teams representing rival layer-2 networks Arbitrum, Polygon and zkSync had vied for Celo's business, with the selection process starting to look like TV's \"The Bachelorette.\"","COSMOS üêû\u2013 Asymmetric Research, a security firm that contributes to the Wormhole interoperability protocol, disclosed details of a vulnerability impacting the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem that it says could have put more than $150 million at risk.","BIPSTERS: Bitcoin Core developer Ava Chow led the nomination process to name five new editors for BIPs, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposals \u2013 the standard for proposing nonbinding software updates that will somehow change the Bitcoin protocol, our Daniel Kuhn reported. The months-long search effort was finalized on Monday, after Jonatack made modifications to the BIP GitHub. A lingering question is whether the addition of editors will make it easier to push through proposals like the pending OP_CAT, which has not been given a BIP number through the formal process, despite reports that originally suggested otherwise.","ALSO:","Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.","1.

One is that the biggest Bitcoin investors tend to be HODLers, and they see no reason to part with their BTC in order to put money into a startup. Another is that many crypto VC firms, in return for their dollars, expect an allocation of digital tokens that would eventually zoom in price, and that's not really an option in for Bitcoin startups, since the community in general is (or was, until recently) averse to anything non-BTC. A final reason is that the Bitcoin developer culture (again, until recently) was so conservative that it didn't really attract the sort of experimentation and entrepreneurship witnessed on other chains.","But there's now a growing cottage industry of venture capitalists and investment firms willing to put money into Bitcoin-focused startups, such as Trammell Venture Partners (TVP) and Ten31.
