And those products which are physically-settled, such as from CoinFLEX, are not available in the U.S. as the platform is not regulated in the country, Woodford added.&nbsp;","Indeed, CoinFLEX is based in Seychelles, and its CEO Mark Lamb, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/03\/18\/inside-the-polychain-backed-offshore-futures-exchange-hoping-to-beat-bakkt\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told<\/a> The Block recently that the exchange is not trying to appeal to the U.S. \u201CThe U.S.-regulated futures market is sub-2% of the crypto derivatives market, which is primarily an Asian phenomenon,\u201D Lamb said at the time.","Seed SEF plans to list a combination of weekly and monthly contracts in a way that at any point there will be four upcoming weekly contracts, three upcoming serial monthly contracts, and two upcoming quarterly monthly contracts available for trading, per the announcement.","Woodford believes that such combination of maturities are \u201Cunique\u201D and act as a \u201Cperfect complement\u201D to those products that are currently available in the market. Specifically, Seed SEF\u2019s weekly contracts will complement offshore contracts on exchanges like OKEx, while monthly contracts will align with the CME\u2019s cash-settled contracts, the CEO explained. He added that Seed SEF\u2019s swaps product is standardized with one bitcoin (BTC) contract size.","Regarding the swap product's margin methodology, the firm said it will use the Value-at-Risk (VaR) model, a measure of the risk of loss for investments. \u201CWe will utilize Value-at-Risk model with a 99% confidence level and a 10 day margin period of risk with additional aspects to account for extreme periods of volatility of the underlying asset of the contract,\u201D Maurice Goodman, head of risk and settlement at Seed CX, told The Block.","Seed SEF is targeting institutional clients, including hedge funds and mining pools for the upcoming product. Woodford did not comment on volumes and revenues the firm is expecting from the product in the near future or in the long run.","The cryptocurrency derivatives market has been burgeoning, with several products lined up in the space.

However, LedgerX still lacks the CFTC approval to do so.","Bakkt has also been preparing to offer one-month and one-day physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts but is still <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/07\/26\/bakkt-is-eyeing-a-launch-in-q3-but-part-of-its-plan-is-risky-sources-say\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">awaiting<\/a> regulatory approvals.
