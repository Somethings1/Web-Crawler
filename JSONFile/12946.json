On the lending side of the house, cumulative loan originations stood at more than $130 billion.","On this episode of The Scoop, head of derivatives at Genesis Joshua Lim helped unpack the dynamics shaping the market behind its headline Q4 numbers.","In addition to a compression in the popular, and once very juicy, basis trade, Lim explained that the market became more dynamic with big new hedge funds entering the fold. At the same time, existing participants become more engaged with the market \u2013 holding crypto on their balance sheet for not just investment purposes, but for operational use as well.","\u201CIt could be linked to receiving payments denominated in tokens from projects that they had executed for other firms. It could be related to running nodes on a blockchain,\u201D Lim said. \u201CIt could be more traditional kind of crypto native use cases like receiving a percentage of whatever assets under custody as sort of a revenue stream.\u201D","\u201CWe saw those types of firms really engaging on derivative hedges that would, you know, protect them on the downside, which was actually kind of useful.\u201D","Lim added that as more firms enter the space through the metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), demand for such hedging tools could extend beyond the crypto native investors that Genesis is used to dealing with. The firm has already started accepting NFTs as collateral for certain loans. Still, it\u2019s early days for NFT-related lending.","\u201CIt's not something that we do on a regular basis,\u201D Lim said. \u201CI think from a business perspective, it's still, let's say, less than 50 basis points of our overall lending business in terms of the magnitude of the collateral value.\"","On this episode, Lim and The Block\u2019s Frank Chaparro also discuss:","Â© 2023 The Block.
