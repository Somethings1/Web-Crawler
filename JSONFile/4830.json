I think it had fairly large limits because of that.\u201D","He noted that by 2022, Alameda accounted for only 2% of trading volume on FTX.&nbsp;","The discredited founder said that Alameda's liabilities to FTX were about $10 billion at the time of its bankruptcy filings.","This is the latest in the series of admissions that he has made to the media since FTX filed for&nbsp; Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month.","On Wednesday, Bankman-Fried&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/191180\/sam-bankman-frieds-bizarre-apology-tour-goes-prime-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told<\/a> the New York Times that he \"messed up big\" and took responsibility for the lack of oversight that led to Alameda Research's risky positions with FTX.
