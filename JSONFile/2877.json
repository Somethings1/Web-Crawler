Amber managing partner Annabelle Huang <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/184883\/amber-group-says-no-exposure-to-ftx-less-than-10-of-trading-funds-stuck\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claims<\/a> less than 10% of the firm's trading capital was stuck on FTX.","Concerns over Ambers' health also haven't been relieved by the news it will further cut staff down from roughly 700 to less than 400, according to Bloomberg. The Financial Times also reports that the office was thinly staffed during a visit to its Hong Kong office on Thursday. Amber previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169008\/amber-group-cuts-10-of-staff\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">trimmed<\/a>&nbsp;its headcount in September.","The untimely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189978\/amber-group-co-founder-tiantian-kullander-dies\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">death<\/a> of 30-year-old co-founder Tiantian Kullander also weighs heavily on Amber and does it no favors regarding investor confidence.","Speaking to the FT, Annabelle Huang pushed back against \"predatory and misinformed\" reports by stating that there is \"no disruption to daily operations\" \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/192502\/amber-group-says-its-business-as-usual-amid-reports-of-more-layoffs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reiterating<\/a> previous statements. Huang also noted that the funding round should not be considered unsuccessful because Amber is \"not under pressure to raise capital.\"","Looking ahead, Amber will reportedly move to a cheaper office in Hong Kong and may close some smaller regional offices, and attracting new clients may prove more difficult than in the past.","© 2023 The Block.
