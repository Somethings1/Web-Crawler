Burn addresses don't hold any funds and are not connected to any other existing wallet addresses, ensuring privacy.","The majority of dApps today require users to provide their ethereum address before they can explore or interact with them, said MEW, adding that with a burn address users can explore dApps without revealing their more permanent wallet addresses where they hold funds.","\u201CMEW Chrome extension is the first to ensure that its users are in total control of which addresses and accounts they share with any Dapps, making user privacy a first priority,\" said Kosala Hemachandra, founder and CEO of MEW, in the announcement.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nHemachandra separately told The Block that the creation of burn addresses gives users \"full control over their Dapp use and their privacy.\"","The updated MEW Chrome extension also blocks known phishing websites to protect users, per the announcement.","MEW always offered a Chrome extension but wanted to give it a full update to improve security and user experience, Hemachandra told The Block. There are currently 158,203 users for the MEW Chrome extension, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/myetherwallet\/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm?hl=en\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chrome web store<\/a>.
