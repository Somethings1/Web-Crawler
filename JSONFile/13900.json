Yet the lending business took a big hit when the cryptocurrency Luna collapsed, removing $30 billion from the crypto market cap and pushing trading firm Three Arrows into bankruptcy. Genesis had made large loans to Three Arrows, which were not repaid. Genesis' parent company DCG took on the debt, which was estimated north of $1 billion.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/public-companies\/active-loans-of-genesis-global-trading\/embed\" title=\"Active Loans of Genesis Global Trading\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Following on from this, Genesis started significantly slowing down its operations.
