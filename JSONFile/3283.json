There\u2019s probably 60-70% less competition right now than there was at the end of 2021 \u2014 brokerages, exchanges, any line you look at.\"","The company's decision to try and tackle new markets comes as Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, has seen its dominance slip and U.S.-based Coinbase is making inroads to expand internationally.","After the 2021&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/193649\/three-arrows-capital-co-founder-says-it-wasnt-luna-that-took-it-out-but-ftx\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">collapse<\/a> of crypto lender Three Arrows Capital, Blockchain.com was left with a $270 million hole.
