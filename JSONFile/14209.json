{"summary":"The surge in total value locked (TVL) on EigenLayer is attributed to continuous ether deposits and the rise in ether\u2019s price.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/280310\/eigenlayers-total-value-locked-surpasses-10-billion?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss","publishDate":"2024-03-03T23:22:31","id":14209,"type":null,"title":"EigenLayer total value locked surpasses $10 billion","category":["CRYPTO ECOSYSTEMS"],"content":["The total value of assets deposited in EigenLayer has increased approximately tenfold from $1.1 billion year-to-date, reaching $10.4 billion at the time of writing \u2014 approximately 2.93 million ether. This positions EigenLayer as the third-largest DeFi protocol, following Lido and Aave.","Eigen\u2019s TVL is slightly less than that of the lending protocol Aave, which is at <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$10.6 billion<\/a>.","EigenLayer&nbsp;offers a protocol for users to deposit and \u201Cre-stake\u201D ether from various liquid staking tokens, aiming to then allocate those funds to secure third-party networks.","Part of the reason for this surge is the continued ether deposits on Eigen (primarily via liquid restaking protocols) coupled with the increase in ether\u2019s price. The protocol\u2019s stage 1 launched on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2023. Within the next eight months, the protocol\u2019s TVL had surged to over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/276919\/eigenlayer-tvl-uncapped-deposits-window\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$6 billion<\/a> in February.","Currently, only the native restaking with EigenPod is open.","The protocol\u2019s strategy involves leveraging ETH\u2019s economic security by accepting native ETH\u2014which can be directly restaked by Ethereum validators\u2014and liquid staked ETH, or liquid staking protocols. This mechanism (called restaking) can then be used to secure other protocols, though this feature is yet to go live.","EigenLabs closed a $50 million Series A funding round in March 2023 led by Blockchain Capital.
