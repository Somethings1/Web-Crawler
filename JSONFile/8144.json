That is something very simple: it is integrity \u2014 the ability to know that something was done the right way, even when you weren\u2019t watching.\u201D","Despite bearish sentiment across markets, StarkWare\u2019s recent fundraise shows VCs are excited about the opportunities unlocked through StarkWare\u2019s scaling technology, and are willing to continue providing the developer with capital.","StarkWare\u2019s two products, StarkEx and StarkNet, both serve as Ethereum scaling solutions, with the former being \"scaling as a service,\" while the latter is permissionless. StarkNet <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/135161\/ethereum-scaling-solution-starknet-completes-launch-with-goal-to-move-to-community-control\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/135161\/ethereum-scaling-solution-starknet-completes-launch-with-goal-to-move-to-community-control\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">completed its launch<\/a> earlier this year, allowing any developer to integrate the platform into their application.","StarkWare's scaling solutions are an important infrastructure improvement for blockchains, as Kolodny highlighted during the interview:","\u201CI often use this metaphor for scaling of Manhattan going from single-story houses circa 17th century to high rises. And that\u2019s the scaling of this limited real estate: Manhattan or the blockchain, we can allow it to scale. What I\u2019m saying is that we don\u2019t know of an upper bound to the height of these skyscrapers at any given moment in time. It may be the metal beams, it may be the glass \u2014 fundamentally we don\u2019t know the limit.\"","<i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro, Kolodny and Ben-Sasson also discuss:<\/i>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fireblocks.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/coinbase.com\/prime\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase Prime<\/a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/crossriver.com\/crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cross River<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.
