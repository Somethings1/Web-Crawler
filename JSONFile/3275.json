The ETC Group analysis said 88.3% of bitcoin addresses and 77.6% of ether addresses are in profit.","\"These percentages are close to the highest readings year-to-date,\" ETC said in a report.","However, the report emphasized that profit-taking activity has primarily occurred among short-term bitcoin holders, those with a holding period of less than 155 days. \"Short-term holders' transfers of bitcoin in profit to exchanges has reached the highest level since July this year. This has certainly held back the current rally a bit due to increasing selling pressure,\" the report added.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ETC Group chart showing the bitcoin price vs BTC realized profit sent to exchanges.<\/span>","According to the ETC Group analysis, last week saw the first week of net outflows from crypto asset exchange traded products since early October. \"In aggregate, we saw net fund outflows to the amount of $18.2 million for the week ending Friday,\" Dragosch said.","According to the analysis, most of these outflows focused on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263127\/bitcoin-etp-exposure-hits-all-time-highs-approval-window-spot-etfs-nears-end\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin ETPs<\/a>, to the sum of $13.1 million.
