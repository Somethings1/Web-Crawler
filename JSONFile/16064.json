One doesn\u2019t have to spend a lot of time on the Urbit Foundation\u2019s website to come across some of the themes popular among blockchain advocates - the idea of trying to short-circuit middlemen and centralized applications that dominate online activity. \u201CWe think the internet can\u2019t be saved. The way things are going, MEGACORP will always control our apps and services because we can no longer run them ourselves,\u201D the site reads.","Read more: Urbit Courts DAOs, Crypto Teams in Quest to Make Internet P2P Again (2022)","Users are identified on the network by their Urbit IDs \u2013 four-syllable pronounceable names generated by an algorithm from a number, then registered as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. (For example, according to the website, the Urbit ID ~dalwel-fadrun ties back to the number 3,509,632,436.)","\u201CYour Urbit ID is meant to feel a bit like a secret code name,\u201D the website reads. \u201CWe want Urbit to be a single, simple interface for your whole digital life.\u201D","This sort of clubbiness, of course, is a major part of the exercise with any blockchain ecosystem, where building a community of staunch followers is one of the hardest parts. And lately, Urbit appears to be getting some traction.","The chart above indicates the user base is growing briskly, with the caveat than an individual can own multiple \"ships,\" or identities. Such growth is partly due to the introduction of personal-server hosting services and better user interfaces that made it easier for normies (non-technical types) to join. The number of developers has doubled over the past year; there\u2019s now about 90 monthly active developers working on the project \u2013 on par with some of the 20 largest blockchain projects.","\u201CFor a long time Urbit wasn\u2019t really growing at all,\u201D acknowledges Josh Lehman aka ~wolref-podlex, executive director of the Urbit Foundation. \u201CIt was just enthusiasts.\u201D","Urbit recently got some exposure to a general audience, after getting a mention in a Vanity Fair article, while another writer spent an entire weekend following attendees around Urbit\u2019s own \u201CAssembly\u201D conference in Miami last September and then chronicling every detail gonzo-style. (Excerpt: \u201CI meet two girls from Minnesota who learned about Urbit on a podcast and wanted to see if they could learn any tricks for building their fashion brand by coming here.\u201D)","The conference also had some prominent speakers, including Balaji Srinivasan, garnering further conversation about the network. Srinivasan, the entrepreneur and \u201CNetwork State\u201D author who more recently grabbed headlines for his unsuccessful $1 million bitcoin bet, was a keynote speaker at the Miami conference. \"Urbit wants to actually be a cathedral,\" Srinivasan said, in a video recording of the talk. \"It's a bit of a bazaar, but it's currently a bit of a bizarre cathedral.\"","Urbit describes itself as an operating system and a network where users keep data on personal servers; that way, users control any data they need to function on the network, unlike many blockchains where data is preserved on-chain \u2013 a feature that\u2019s often championed for the transparency benefits. Then, using the Urbit peer-to-peer network, users simply interact with each other and keep local records of those interactions.","Curtis Yarvin, a computer scientist, started the project in 2002 - long before Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin white paper was published in October 2008. His fringe political views, associated with what\u2019s known as the \u201CDark Enlightenment\" or \u201Cneo-reactionary movement\u201D were so pronounced that they were hard to ignore in any conversation about Urbit.","Read more: Urbit Is Web3, Weird and Wonderful and I Don\u2019t Care Who Made It (2022)","In 2019 Yarvin (aka ~sorreg-namtyv) stepped down as CTO, board member and voting shareholder of Tlon, the company that previously sponsored Urbit\u2019s development, writing at the time, \u201CFrom the very start, I knew Urbit could not succeed until it ceased to be mine and became the world\u2019s.\u201D","\u201CUrbit is not uniformly excellent quite yet,\u201D Yarvin wrote. \u201CThere are a few medium-sized cleanups in the near-term pipeline. But this is a matter of months, not years. I don't see any unknown unknowns,\u201D he said.","According to the Urbit Foundation's website, the non-profit was established in 2021 when it split off from Tlon, a private company formed in 2013 to work on the network.","Advocates for Urbit are quick to claim that the underlying programming language is simple and elegant because it only needed to solve the problem of how to best create a peer-to-peer network. The entire Urbit operating system supposedly compiles down to 33 lines of code, known as \u201CNock.\u201D","There are plenty of Urbit talking points that sound like core arguments for Web3 \u2013 the imagined next iteration of the internet, which would promote decentralized protocols while reducing dependency on large tech companies like Youtube, Netflix and Amazon.","One example from Urbit\u2019s website: \u201CFor the most part, we use our laptops simply as access points to MEGACORP services. Our phones are the same. These services are amazing and convenient. But for that convenience we\u2019ve traded away control, ownership and privacy.\u201D","One of the Urbit faithful, Hocwyn Tipwex (he no longer uses his real name in a professional context), is co-founder of the Uqbar Network, which is building a zero-knowledge rollup to Ethereum.","He says Urbit\u2019s inherent peer-to-peer design makes it easy to design peer-to-peer applications and decentralized apps known as dapps. So far there are apps for chatting and social media as well as poker on the Urbit network.","\u201CPeer-to-peer infrastructure is harder than it looks,\u201D Tipwex said last month at CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus 2023 conference in Austin, Texas.","What\u2019s also hard is building a community to rally around any project, crypto or otherwise. Urbit\u2019s weird, little band of devout followers with secret code names might serve as a decent start as the project tries to build a bigger and more user-friendly ecosystem. Projects like Tipwex\u2019s show how the network might ultimately bleed into crypto."],"entity":[{"type":"Urbit","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Josh Lehman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Urbit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Amazon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"October 2008","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Miami","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Austin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Netflix","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Minnesota","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Balaji Srinivasan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Urbit Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201CNetwork State","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nock","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus 2023","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Teams","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Curtis Yarvin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2002","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Uqbar Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Texas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"MEGACORP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tipwex","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Srinivasan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CTO","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Analysis","peer-to-peer","Consensus 2023","DeFi","Zkevm","The Protocol"],"authors":["Bradley Keoun"]}
