Arkhom stated that such companies will have to register their token offerings to benefit from the tax waiver. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/138910\/thailand-bans-use-of-crypto-for-payments-but-not-trading-and-investing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Investment tokens are legal in Thailand<\/a> despite the government banning the use of cryptocurrencies for payments in March 2022.","Thailand\u2019s new crypto tax policy also extends to investors. Those who invest in these token sales will also be exempted from paying value-added tax. This is the crypto-related value-added tax exemption. Last year, Thailand\u2019s government <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/148950\/thailand-excludes-crypto-transfers-from-vat-payments-until-2024\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">waived VAT for crypto transfers<\/a> until 2024.","Arkhom stated that that tax waiver could see the government forgo revenue of up to 35 billion baht ($1 billion) in the next two years. This is based on an estimated 128 billion baht revenue ($3.7 billion) from investment token offerings during the period.","Utility tokens are, however, not covered in this crypto tax exemption policy. This position is due to the fact that their use depends on the promotional activity of their issuers, the finance minister stated.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
