These constraints, he noted, are part of a general drawdown occasioned by the year-long crypto bear market. Despite these issues, the Bitcoin lender's CEO said its loan book is still over-collateralized, with a collateral-to-principal ratio of 214%.","Kelly also said the company did not have any exposure to bankrupt crypto exchange FTX or its sister trading firm Alameda Research. Still, he said the Bitcoin lender is caught up in the current challenging crypto market and needs to plan for the long term. He added that some of the company\u2019s hires during the last bull-market period are no longer sustainable.","The Unchained Capital CEO said affected employees will receive compensation. \u201CWe are offering a severance package that includes paying an additional 1-2 months of base pay depending on tenure, paying up to two month\u2019s premium for health care continuation benefits, pro-rating of first year vesting of options and accelerating any bonus options, and extending the option exercise window,\u201D Kelly said.","Unchained Capital is not the first crypto firm to announce job cuts in the current decline. Several other companies have also culled staff strength in recent months.
