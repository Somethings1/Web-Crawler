The value locked in that exchange alone has surpassed <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/agni-finance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$23 million<\/a>, with the cumulative trading volume <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/agni-finance?volume=true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reaching<\/a> $53.6 million.","The network\u2019s growth has been further substantiated by the influx of assets sent to Mantle from the Ethereum bridge. Around 5,000 unique addresses have bridged nearly $56 million from Ethereum to Mantle, according to a Nansen <a href=\"https:\/\/research.nansen.ai\/articles\/a-quick-guide-to-mantle-network-1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a>.","Sandra Leow, a research analyst at Nansen, attributed Mantle Network\u2019s TVL growth to the current trend of Layer 2 chains launching and \"the capital rotation from Ethereum\u2019s mainnet.\"","\u201CMantle Network holds one of the largest on-chain treasuries (BitDAO rebranded and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231557\/ethereum-layer-2-mantle-network-merges-with-backer-bitdao?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">merged<\/a> with Mantle), with $3.2 billion in liquid assets, most of which are in Mantle tokens, followed by stablecoins. This provides insight into their branding and credibility of the L2,\u201D Leow told The Block.","In an effort to spur further growth, Mantle\u2019s DAO-led ecosystem recently greenlighted a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238570\/mantle-network-is-voting-to-form-a-200-million-ecosystem-fund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$200 million fund<\/a> to support early-stage apps on the Ethereum Layer 2. This fund could enhance Mantle\u2019s prospects for building a rapidly expanding ecosystem, Leow added.","Unlike traditional blockchains, where all transactions are funneled through a single layer, Mantle has introduced a more dynamic approach. It employs a modular chain system, breaking down execution, data availability, consensus and settlement into separate layers.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/scaling-solutions\/scaling-overview\/value-locked-of-ethereum-optimistic-rollups\/embed\" title=\"Value Locked in Ethereum Optimistic Rollups (Escrow Contracts)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
