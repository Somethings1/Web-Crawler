Users who want to be part of a token launch can in turn purchase, manage, and earn rewards via staking on the platform.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Activate team estimates that SKALE\u2019s token sale will take place in Q2. Before that, users can pre-register for the token launch as SKALE\u2019s development team continues its testing efforts.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In selecting potential launch partners, Activate aims to choose projects that have already reached a mature stage of development and are prepared for mainnet launch, Collin Myers from ConsenSys\u2019 Global DeFi Product Strategy told The Block. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Other considerations include whether the project has adequate token design, the level of transparency in the development work, and whether their governance mechanisms are decentralized.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe are very limited to the projects that we can work with due to many factors, the primary one being maturity of the technology,\u201D Myers said. \u201CWe're not going to support a project who's not going to mainnet soon... We'd like to work with mature projects that are focused on participation, distribution, and strengthening and bootstrapping the network from the beginning.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There are two main reasons why Activate decided to partner with SKALE, according to Myers. First, the team believes that SKALE is a fairly mature project. Second,&nbsp; SKALE\u2019s layer-2 scaling solution fits Activate\u2019s mission to support projects conducive to the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CRight now, many of the excuses of people not building applications on Ethereum has to do with low speeds, low transaction throughput, or not having the scalability that they desire,\u201D Myers said. \"SKALE is a project that needs support.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On the utilization side of the platform, Activate adopts the \u201CProof of Use\u201D mechanism to make sure that users who wish to participate in token launches intend to use the tokens rather than speculate on them, said Activate co-lead Ejaaz Ahamadeen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf you successfully go through all the pre-requirements to register for the SKALE launch, for example, and you end up purchasing a thousand SKALE tokens, you will then be required to utilize at least 50 percent of those tokens to delegate to a validator to validate transactions on the SKALE network,\u201D Ahamadeen said.<\/span>"],"hashtag":[]}
