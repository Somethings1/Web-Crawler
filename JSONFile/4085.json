Some users may take to Twitter to ask \u201CIs anyone building the thing I need?\u201D. The very brave may even try to manually cobble together their strategy by clicking buttons and signing Tx\u2019s across multiple protocols; monitoring everything in a spreadsheet. This is the manual, transactional approach to DeFi. It\u2019s spurned a cottage industry of YouTubers like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@TheCalculatorGuy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Calculator Guy<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and Taiki Maeda who\u2019ve garnered a following by making the technically overwhelming approachable through shareable spreadsheets and click by click guides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This is where Intents come in. \u201CIntent based products are a move away from the transactional approach to DeFi,\u201D Aperture\u2019s McDavid Stoddard told <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. In the transactional model, the transaction is \u201Ctypically too complicated for the end user to fully understand what\u2019s happening,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Intent based architectures enable the average DeFi user to gain access to \u201Cthe types of execution and pricing that previously were only accessible to well capitalized prop shops operating with an in-house developer team. Even a devoted DeFi user armed with YouTube premium and tracking spreadsheets would fail to get the level of execution and expressibility that is possible with an Intent based DeFi UX.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.aperture.finance\/?source=PR&amp;category=Article&amp;tag=Intents&amp;title=Block\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aperture\u2019s Liquidity Intents solution<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, built atop Uniswap V3, the user declares an end goal for their LP position and the transaction is only executed if it matches the user\u2019s desired outcome. A user can, for example, declare that they want their liquidity position to rebalance once ETH hits 3,500 USDC per ETH, rebalance to a 50:50 ratio at a range of 3,400 to 3,600 USDC, and specify the acceptable range of price impact from swaps and gas fees.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A decentralized network of solvers then works out possible transaction flows which are then simulated and ranked.

A Large Language Model (LLM) will enable users to express their intent in natural language and have it mirrored back to them in a highly readable Domain Specific Language (DSL) created by Aperture, which can then be delivered to solvers as the user\u2019s \u201Cdeclaration of truth.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stoddard likens the UX to ordering a pizza. \u201CYou tell the operator, \u2018I want whatever your biggest meatiest pizza is.\u2019 The operator will mirror back to you, \u2018Okay, you want our XL meat lovers\u2019 pizza?\u2019 And then the user says, \u2018Yes, that one!\u2019\u201D Aperture\u2019s UX will enable the user to declare their DeFi Intents in similar terms. \u201CThe user will say, \u2018I want you to rebalance me to the highest yielding pool,\u2019 and then the Intents chatbot will mirror back to them the highly readable DSL output which the user will be able to eye-ball and confirm.\u201D<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by Aperture and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
