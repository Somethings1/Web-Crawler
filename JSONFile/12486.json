There were so few VCs that would invest in crypto - at least during the bear markets the last five years - those funds had huge amounts of leverage and could operate in a way that was very beneficial to the funds. That leverage has shifted to the founders, and now the founders get to be very selective and choose what they want.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So what are these crypto-native founders looking for when it comes to selecting VC firms? Maguire believes they are looking for funds that can keep pace with the fast-paced crypto industry:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCrypto moves so fast, crypto founders want to work with funds that can move incredibly fast,&nbsp; they want to work with funds that deeply understand their problems, deeply understand the landscape.
