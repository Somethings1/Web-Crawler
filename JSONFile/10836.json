Trump himself has refused to comply with a congressional subpoena to testify about his role regarding the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The former president also faces an investigation into the alleged mishandling of highly sensitive classified documents, which federal law enforcement found at the same club where he announced his latest presidential bid.&nbsp;<\/span>","The former president will likely begin a Republican primary as the de facto frontrunner, though an increasing number of elected Republicans have called for the party to move on after an underwhelming midterm outcome for the party.
