In Loomdart's view, cryptocurrencies are no longer as correlated with one other as they once were. However, he also acknowledged that today the recent Metaverse and NFT headlines have temporarily \u201Chijacked\u201D momentum in the $2 trillion market.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CEver since this kind of metaverse narrative started and Facebook did the whole 'Meta' brand takeover, there has been this gigantic influx of capital,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To be sure, Loomdart is also talking his own book as the founder of MetaDrop, which recently helped Alien-themed shooting game VAIL raise money through an NFT drop. But the anonymous UK-native has data to back up his investment thesis. Over the past month, NFT gaming firm Sandbox raised $93 million, while Solana Ventures, FTX, and Lightspeed Venture Partners has raised $100 million for a blockchain gaming fund.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Loomdart told Chaparro that this VC interest in the metaverse and NFTs will ultimately feed back into the broader crypto market, thereby making it more dynamic.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis isn't 2017, 2018's crypto anymore,\u201D Said Loomdart. \u201CEverything was just one market, but like crypto has evolved so far beyond that.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this episode, Chaparro and Loomdart discuss:<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
