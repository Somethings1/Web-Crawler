It should also be flexible enough to deal with future challenges \u2013 such as how Decentralised Finance (DeFi) should be regulated.\u201D<\/em>","The Treasury <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/90540\/uk-finance-ministry-hm-treasury-opens-consultation-regulating-crypto-stablecoins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">published a consultation paper<\/a> and call for evidence on the UK\u2019s regulatory approach to crypto and stablecoins in January.","The review also called for the UK to continue to participate in the Global Financial Innovation Network \u2013 a working group of national regulators \u2013 and to lead the way on crypto policy and regulation. The government should keep the initiatives of other international markets \u201Cunder review\u201D so as not to fall behind, it added.&nbsp;","The long-anticipated Kalifa review is an effort to help the UK maintain its position as a leading hub for fintech businesses \u2013 something of an obsession among British politicians.","It is comprised of five key workstreams, which are policy and regulation; skills; investment; international connectivity; and national connectivity.","Calls for the creation of a £1bn growth fund had already grabbed headlines when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/article\/ron-kalifas-fintech-review-calls-for-1bn-fund-to-help-fast-growing-start-ups-gf2d5n9zz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">they leaked<\/a> in January.","\u201CThis would be a market-led, specialist £1bn Fintech Growth Fund. It would be funded by holders of domestic institutional capital and, where feasible, utilise existing regulatory concessions made applicable only to the fund, thus providing a vehicle to support growth from Series B to pre-IPO stage and the option to hold beyond,\u201D the report stated. &nbsp;","The review also called for changes to UK listing rules through the reduction of free float requirements (the proportion of shares startups have to make available for investment when they go public), the introduction of dual class shares, and the relaxation of pre-emption rights.","These recommendations come amid <a href=\"https:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/pm-woos-british-tech-unicorns-in-race-for-london-listings-12166691\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fears of a mass exodus<\/a> of the UK\u2019s promising pipeline of potential fintech IPOs to the US.","© 2023 The Block.
