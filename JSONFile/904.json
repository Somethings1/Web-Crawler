Still, he argued that current transaction fees are not high enough to provide the same level of security.&nbsp;","\u201CFirst, in the long term, Bitcoin security is going to come entirely from fees, and Bitcoin is just not succeeding at getting the level of fee revenue required to secure what could be a multi-trillion-dollar system,\u201D he said.","He noted that Bitcoin sees roughly $300,000 in fees per day, a figure that hasn\u2019t grown much over the past five years \u2014 although it has spiked as high as $21 million. In contrast, Bitcoin miners currently earn around $18.5 million per day.","Buterin\u2019s second point was that he claims proof of stake is a more efficient way of providing security to a blockchain network than proof of work. While Ethereum is on the verge of migrating from proof of work to proof of stake (scheduled to happen this month), this is unlikely to happen to Bitcoin \u2014 as most Bitcoiners are staunchly against it.","Yet Buterin remained optimistic that it could be a possibility.","\u201COf course, if Bitcoin actually gets attacked, I do expect that the political will to switch to at least hybrid proof of stake will quickly appear, but I expect that to be a painful transition,\u201D he said.","As for the differences between proof of work and proof of stake, Buterin acknowledged the argument that the latter has stronger centralization pressures.&nbsp;","\u201CThese are definitely things that I worry about, though I think people overstate them,\u201D he said.","In response to these issues, Buterin highlighted some problems related to the current state of staking on Ethereum \u2014 such as withdrawals not being enabled yet \u2014 but pointed out that these will be fixed within the next year or so.&nbsp;","He then compared staking to mining and claimed that large mining pools are close to certain governments, which could lead to censorship in the future (something that Ethereum is also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162105\/us-treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-mixer-tornado-cash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">grappling<\/a> with).","He added, \u201CThe highly democratized early proof of work era was a beautiful thing, and it helped tremendously in making cryptocurrency ownership more egalitarian, but it\u2019s unsustainable and it\u2019s not coming back.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
