Soul Capital, Moonrock Capital, and PANONY also participated in the round.","With the fresh capital in place, Linear Finance will further develop its synthetic asset protocol to launch testnet in October and mainnet in November, co-founder Kevin Tai told The Block in an interview. Synthetic assets are tokenized forms of physical assets and synthetic asset tokens are derivatives that can be traded with leverage.","Synthetix and Universal Market Access (UMA) are two of the popular synthetic asset protocols in the DeFi market today. Both these protocols are built on Ethereum and aren't compatible with other blockchains. Linear Finance, built on Ethereum, will also have cross-chain compatibility, Tai told The Block.","\u201CWe will be interoperable. We will be integrating with Binance Smart Chain to start with and two other blockchains in the near future,\u201D said Tai, without disclosing the other two blockchains' names as partnerships with them aren't official yet. With the interoperability function, Linear Finance would be able to access Binance\u2019s customers, said Tai.","Linear Finance would also be cheaper and faster, co-founder Drey Ng told The Block in a separate interview, referring to low gas fees and speedy oracle price feeds. With Binance Smart Chain, the oracle update frequency will be reduced to 10 seconds from the current range of three to 10 minutes, said Ng. As for gas fees, it could be only 10% of what Ethereum is charging, said Ng.","Binance Smart Chain was launched only last week and is yet to onboard a significant number of decentralized apps. When asked why Linear Finance chose this blockchain, Ng told The Block that \u201CBinance Smart Chain is highly likely Ethereum killer.\u201D","It is not clear whether Binance has invested in Linear Finance, Tai declined to comment when asked. As for BNB\u2019s role in Linear Finance protocol, Ng told The Block that the coin could be one of the collaterals, in addition to Linear\u2019s native token LINA.","As part of today\u2019s strategic funding round, NGC Ventures\u2019 Tony Gu and Hashed\u2019s Ryan Kim have joined Linear Finance\u2019s advisory board. \u201CSynthetic asset creation is a key part of the DeFi ecosystem, and we believe Linear will emerge as a leader in this space,\u201D said Gu."],"hashtag":[]}
