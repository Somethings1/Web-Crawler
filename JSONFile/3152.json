By providing an easy way to set up and launch new gaming applications, BetProtocol is well-positioned to become one of the top players of the space.\"","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CEthereum of Gaming?\u201D<\/strong>","Founded in 2018, Portugal-based BetProtocol has set an ambitious goal for itself - it plans to become the \u201CEthereum of Gaming,\u201D which would help deploy casino games, esports and prediction markets on blockchains - natively integrated with cryptocurrencies.","The fresh capital will help meet some of its goals. \u201CWe will use this investment to launch in China and South Korea, to scale the team and technology, and to take BetProtocol to other verticals like gaming in Esports and Sports,\u201D said Rui Teixeira, co-founder and CEO of BetProtocol.","Overall, the firm\u2019s vision is to bring \u201Csafety, fairness, and transparency\u201D for players, operators, and regulators in the online gaming industry. \u201CThe current iteration of the online gaming industry is broken. For players, odds and game logic are not transparent, for operators it is prohibitively expensive to enter the market and compete with incumbents, and for regulators, their compliance checking is time-consuming and not-standardized. BetProtocol fixes these issues,\u201D Wu told The Block.","BetProtocol is not the only platform building blockchain solutions for gaming. Wink and FunFair provide similar offerings. \u201CWe differ from the two firms in that our token model is built to scale with the network usage, and we don't force players to wager in our utility token. We are also a business-to-business software as a service (B2B SaaS) from the beginning whereas our competitors are just pivoting into that space,\u201D Wu further told The Block, adding:","\u201CWe are 10x cheaper and faster for new entrants to startup in the online gaming space. We charge very competitive setup and monthly subscription fees, while providing games for a small percentage of the revenue.\u201D","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Looking ahead<\/strong>","BetProtocol is currently a ten-member team, grown from four people since last year, said Wu. The firm is looking to hire more talent, on both developers and sales sides.","While Wu did not disclose the financial details of BetProtocol, he said the firm is targeting \u201Cmonthly recurring revenue of over six figures\u201D in 2020, with \u201Cover 10 clients in the pipeline on-boarding as operators.\u201D","It is also planning to conduct a public sale of its tokens \u201Csoon\" and list BEPRO on \"high liquidity\" cryptocurrency exchanges in Q4 of this year. Wu said it built BEPRO so that it can be used by operators to pay gas fees in a staking model, and for security against fake betting volume. \"Since each bet has an underlying BEPRO fee attached to it that scales with the value of the bet, fake bets become prohibitively expensive at higher values.\"","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/category\/gaming\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gaming<\/a> as a use case is indeed catching up.
