While we factored Grayscale win into our previous 65% odds, the unanimity and decisiveness of ruling was beyond expectations and leaves the SEC with very little wiggle room,\" Balchunas <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EricBalchunas\/status\/1696887691122548798\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> in a post on X (formerly Twitter).","\"A lot of people were asking yesterday. Eric and I have moved to 75% for a 2023 launch of a spot bitcoin ETF and we think it\u2019s almost a done deal that we will have one launched by the end of 2024,\" Seyffart <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JSeyff\/status\/1696888736246559143\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">confirmed<\/a>.","\"We think the legal and PR loss will combine to make denial politically untenable,\" Balchunas <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EricBalchunas\/status\/1696889309704356318?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">added<\/a>.","Deadlines for the SEC\u2019s decision to approve, reject or delay applications from BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie fall from Sept. 1 to Sept. 4. However, the analysts expect delays.","\"We will not be surprised if the SEC delays given the ruling just happened. That said, I'm not sure timelines will matter as much in this situation. Probably more likely we wake up one day and hear SEC has given in, and a launch is imminent,\" Balchunas <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EricBalchunas\/status\/1696890179896639559?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>.","\"We're expecting delay orders this week on a bunch of the applications.

Beyond this period, the court will issue a final mandate and further directives.","The SEC can now either approve the conversion of GBTC into an ETF, deny it for some other reason or force the closure of existing futures-based bitcoin ETFs, The ETF Store President Nathan Geraci <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/246115\/court-hands-grayscale-win-in-long-running-suit-against-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> following the decision.","&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
