Foremost, in the financial sphere with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi). Secondly, in the cultural sphere with the explosion of activity around non-fungible tokens (NFTs). <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But anyone who has been closely following knows that we have only scratched the surface of discovering what experiences general purpose blockchains are capable of delivering.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">And while the term \u201CEthereum killer\u201D has fallen out of favor, the pace of development in the Layer 1 platform arena has only accelerated over the past years. Dozens of platforms have emerged.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Some are seeking to offer an easily adoptable alternative to Ethereum and challenge its status as the de-facto choice for launching decentralized applications. Others are focused on giving developers the highest level of flexibility in building their own blockchains and creating cross-chain communication protocols.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With each passing year, a \u201Cone blockchain to rule them all\u201D outcome fades further and further into the rearview. But analyzing these different platforms remains challenging.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">They are surrounded by technical jargon. Digestible comparisons amongst them are few and far between. Yet they already compose a significant portion of the \u201Cinvestable crypto landscape\u201D and are poised to support ecosystems orders of magnitude larger than what we have seen to date. Analyzing them will be an important task for years to come.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Analyzing smart contract platforms outside of the context of Ethereum is difficult. Analyzing Ethereum outside of the context of Bitcoin is equally difficult. So, this report starts with a brief introduction to Bitcoin before diving into the current state of Ethereum.&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
