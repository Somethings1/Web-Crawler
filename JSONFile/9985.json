A lot of the projects back in 2017 and 2018 were on a wrong track with this pseudo proposition of blockchain+,\" Wang Xi, a partner of Bixin Ventures, said in an interview. \"Currently there are very few China's home-grown DeFi teams and we want to be the bridge to incubate and help grow them to a global scale.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;","The firm recently invested $2 million, as a lead investor together with Three Arrow Capital, in Mina Protocol, a blockchain Layer-1 project that uses zero-proof knowledge. Bixin also invested in bitcoin miner maker MicroBT and blockchain projects like Algorand, Nervos, Conflux and Certik, among others.&nbsp;","Bixin was founded in 2014, known as HaoBTC at the time, by Wu Gang, who started mining bitcoin since 2009.

Its mining business now operates at around 3,000 petahashes per second of computing power, accounting for about 2% of the Bitcoin network's total hashrate.","In May, Bixin rolled a fund of funds denominated in 6,600 bitcoin \u2013 worth around $66 million at the time \u2013 for trading desks to improve bitcoin market liquidity.","Â© 2023 The Block.
