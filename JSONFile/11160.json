That\u2019s what former Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair J. Christopher Giancarlo told the Senate banking committee\u2019s subcommittee on economic policy in a hearing today.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Giancarlo, who has emerged <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/66832\/giancarlo-now-is-the-time-for-the-u-s-to-jump-into-the-digital-currency-game\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as a leading advocate for the \u201Cdigital dollar\u201D<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> since his term at the CFTC ended in April 2019, testified at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.banking.senate.gov\/hearings\/us-china-winning-the-economic-competition\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a hearing<\/a> focused on economic competition between the U.S. and China.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">China is widely expected to be the first major economy to issue a sovereign digital currency as early as this year, a prospect that some national security experts have suggested could pose a threat to the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance over the global financial system. But the question of whether the U.S. needs to follow suit is not only a geopolitical one, according to Giancarlo.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As he has before, Giancarlo stressed that policymakers should view the dollar as a technology in itself. \u201CHow do we enhance its technological capability in the world?\u201D he asked. \u201CThis is what China is experimenting with today in their own currency, to make it technologically superior by making it digital, tokenizable, fractionalizable, and programmable.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">America needs to start experimenting too, Giancarlo said. Earlier this month, during <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/70152\/senators-digital-dollar-hearing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a hearing of the full banking committee<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, he proposed that the Department of Treasury start conducting pilots. This time, when pressed by economic policy subcommittee chair Tom Cotton, he got a bit more specific.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">First, he said, to \u201Cfuture-proof\u201D the dollar, the U.S. has to approach a potential technological upgrade in \u201Cthe same way we explored space, with a series of deliberate pilot programs with each one building on the one before.\u201D Giancarlo said the pilots should focus on issues such as privacy, financial inclusion, areas that are \u201Cunderserved by banks,\u201D wholesale payments, and international payments. \u201CThere are so many elements of this,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He went further: \u201CWe could do discrete programs in, say, one Fed regional area that\u2019s focused on rural issues. We could do another one in another area focused on inner city issues. We could do another on global remittances.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere\u2019s so much that we need to look at,\u201D said Giancarlo. \u201CWe could gather that information on that and build something that would be durable and long-lasting.\u201D<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
