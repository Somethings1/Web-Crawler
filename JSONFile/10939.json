At the end of that period, Stronghold has the option to buy the containers for $2 million to $6 million, again based on mining economics at the time.","The deal will give Stronghold more \"operational control\" of its bitcoin business while improving cash flow generation over the next two years, according to co-chairman and CEO Greg Beard.","\"Overall, we believe that we continue to make significant progress towards improving our balance sheet, liquidity and cost structure to deliver shareholder value,\" Beard said.","The company recently announced a deal to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163606\/stronghold-shifts-focus-from-bitcoin-mining-to-selling-power-as-it-restructures-debt\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">eliminate $67.4 million in outstanding debt with NYDIG<\/a> by returning about 26,200 mining machines, while also restructuring a loan with WhiteHawk and adding up to $20 million of additional borrowing capacity.
