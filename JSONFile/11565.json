The WETH token represents tokenized Ether on the Ethereum blockchain, and the value of WETH is pegged to the value of ETH one-to-one.","The debt ceiling for WETH collateral is set at $200 million, meaning that only 200 million crvUSD stablecoins can be minted with WETH as collateral.","Curve currently accepts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233724\/curve-finance-now-lets-you-use-wrapped-staked-ether-to-borrow-its-stablecoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wrapped Staked Ether<\/a> and Staked Frax Ether as collateral for minting its stablecoin. Both are Ethereum derivatives.","The crvUSD stablecoin was first launched on the Ethereum mainnet last month by Curve Finance developers. Employing a token design akin to MakerDAO\u2019s DAI stablecoin, crvUSD does not rely on dollar reserves, but rather is over-collateralized by supported crypto assets that surpass the value of issued crvUSD.","Much like DAI, crypto users can mint crvUSD stablecoins through over-collateralized loans on the Curve platform.

Known as LLAMMA, it manages the risk associated with the stablecoin while maintaining its peg to the U.S. dollar.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
