The judge\u2019s decision on retail investors, though, was more of a sticking point.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhile disappointed on what they said about retail investors, we\u2019re still looking at it and assessing that opinion,\u201D Gensler said on Monday at a National Press Club luncheon where he was discussing artificial intelligence.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC accused Ripple in 2020 of illegally raising $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP. Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York ruled last week that XRP was not a security when sold on the secondary market, but would be a security when sold to institutional investors.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Torres said that Ripple\u2019s \u201Cblind bid\u201D or \u201Cprogrammatic\u201D sales, where the firm used algorithms to sell XRP on trading platforms, was not a securities offering.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Buyers \u201Ccould not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple,\u201D and so most people who bought XRP on exchanges did not invest in Ripple, Torres said. Torres also noted that since 2017, programmatic sales made up less than 1% of the global XRP trading volume.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The agency has taken on a number of big crypto firms, including crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase over the past few months. The SEC accused both of failing to register with the agency, while also alleging that Binance lied to customers.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSo what\u2019s next? We\u2019re going to continue to try to bring firms that may not be into compliance into compliance without prejudging any one of them and trying to ensure that we protect the investing public,\u201D Gensler said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp; <\/span><\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
