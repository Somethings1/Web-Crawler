Those customers are unlikely to see the return of their entire holdings at the end of those bankruptcy processes.","The financial markets regulator also challenged the concept of decentralized finance.","\u201CThis field is actually quite centralized,\u201D Gensler said, arguing that decentralized projects sometimes have individuals with the title of CEO or chief technology officer, and that the assets are often held by less than 100 people. \u201CFinance tends towards some centralization.\u201D","\u201CThe investing public comes first, that\u2019s how our securities laws were first written, companies raising money in the markets as well, and really protecting them and protecting the integrity of the markets as well,\u201D he added.","Gensler declined to comment directly on the Ripple case, citing \u201Congoing litigation.\u201D In addition to the possibility of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239537\/sec-leaves-door-open-for-appeal-in-ripple-case\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an appeal<\/a> of the split decision, which saw the judge side with the SEC on Ripple\u2019s sales to institutional investors but with the company as to whether blind bid sales constituted securities violations, the SEC also has active enforcement cases against U.S. crypto giant Coinbase and global trading leader Binance.","The SEC chair also demurred when asked his thoughts about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/240020\/house-vote-on-crypto-stablecoin-bills-now-delayed-by-a-week\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">legislation<\/a> in the House of Representatives aimed at tweaking existing rules around digital assets to create a clear pathway for a security asset to become a commodity, as well as giving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more power over spot markets.","\u201CWe are asked by members of Congress, both in the House and the Senate, and we generally give them our feedback directly rather than through the interviews on-air,\u201D Gensler said. \u201CI\u2019m going to save our comments for any draft legislation for members who are asking us directly.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
