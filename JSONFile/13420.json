The growth of Ethereum staking service Lido has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255116\/jpmorgan-ethereum-more-centralized-staking\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised concerns<\/a> around economic centralization in Ethereum since the blockchain's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus.&nbsp;","Aside from other small changes, the core priorities of the Ethereum ecosystem remain the same from last year's outline. Vitalik declined to estimate a timeline for the changes to the ecosystem, though the changes are ordered roughly according to priority.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
