No valuation was disclosed.","Simon Harman, founder and CEO of Chainflip, told The Block that the startup is trying to \u201Ctake capital efficiency to the logical extreme\u201D with a simple interface and user experience that negates the need for wrapped tokens or niche wallets.","\u201CReally what we\u2019re trying to do is not just build something where you can bridge tokens from one chain to another,\u201D he said. \u201CWe\u2019re trying to build something that can displace the role of the centralized exchange in crypto, because frankly speaking they are still the most widely used solution.\u201D","While Harman concedes that decentralized exchanges like the Ethereum-based Uniswap have to some extent done that already, he sees Chainflip as unique in not being tied to any one chain. Chainflip has its own network of validators and is running its own blockchain, Harman added.","The company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/markets\/2021\/08\/19\/cross-chain-protocol-chainflip-raises-6m-to-fund-growth-security-audits\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $6 million<\/a> through a private token sale in August 2021. The token, FLIP, will be used as collateral for the protocol\u2019s validators. \u201CThe token doesn\u2019t currently exist but we have a range of contracts with 50 distinct investors,\u201D said Harman.","Framework Ventures led the token sale, alongside a number of other specialist crypto investment firms. Chainflip is planning an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) to publicly launch the FLIP token later this year.","The latest capital injection of $10 million gives the team runway for the next three to four years, Harman said. It also means that the proceeds of the upcoming token sale can be freed up for providing liquidity \u2014 both for Chainflip\u2019s automated market-maker (AMM) and for the FLIP token itself.","Chainflip is not Harman\u2019s first crypto endeavour. He founded and continues to sit on the board of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/oxen.io\/who-are-we\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Oxen,<\/a>&nbsp;a private cryptocurrency and messaging app. Harman began focusing on Chainflip in 2020, and today the company employs some 25 people.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
