We believe the driving factor of ETH is the development of the technology and ecosystem. The demand and the price of ETH will continue to rise, at some point, likely to overturn bitcoin which has no real business use case other than value storage and transaction,\" Yang told The Block.","According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252563\/coinshares-us-hedge-fund-division\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinShares<\/a> data, bitcoin dominance peaked at around 54.4% last week and is currently at 52.7%. \"This, together with the fact that bitcoin is still sitting at its yearly high of $34,700 to $35,000, suggests that altcoins are performing well with a stagnant bitcoin,\" Nolan said.","YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha has also observed indicators that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/261737\/xrp-leads-altcoin-rally-as-ripple-scores-legal-wins-and-new-cbcd-partnerships\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">altcoin<\/a> market has soaked up some of the capital inflow fueling bitcoin's recent rise. \"There is some spillover of bullish sentiment in the market, and the upward trend may continue. Unfortunately, we cannot call the growth sustained just yet, because the macro impacts the market in the long term,\" Lienkha added.","Lienkha stressed that although ether has had a recent uptick, its reaction over the past weeks is still quite restrained compared to the growth witnessed in the rest of the crypto market. He expressed general concern over ether's market reaction, considering it has such a central position within the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. \"Ether looks weak despite its correlation with the market, and we expected to see ETH at much higher prices, at least at $2,000, due to its important role as the second biggest cryptocurrency in the crypto world,\" Lienkha told The Block.","The YouHodler chief of markets advised investors to pay close attention to how the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252066\/bitcoins-price-is-flat-as-federal-reserve-keeps-interest-rates-unchanged\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">U.S. Federal Reserve<\/a> will direct its monetary policy at the next Federal Reserve Open Market meeting. \"The economic data from the U.S. and the next Fed meeting will affect and adjust all markets' sentiment. So, the current situation is slightly different from previous crypto bull runs, as the crypto market was more isolated from TradFi before,\" Lienkha added.","The next <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/261984\/federal-reserves-michael-barr-calls-for-a-strong-federal-framework-for-stablecoins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FOMC<\/a> meeting will be held over Dec. 12-13. The Fed held rates steady at 5.25%-5.50% at its November and September 2023 FOMC meetings, which has provided some respite for liquidity-starved equity markets.","Â© 2023 The Block.
