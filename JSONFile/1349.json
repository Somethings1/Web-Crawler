Data shows it was the real cause for people to dump FTT,\u201D he said, referring to a Twitter post from Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX's sister trading firm, Alameda Research.","Other cryptocurrency exchange CEOs have also condemned Bankman-Fried and criticised the response to FTX's collapse, including that media have been too sympathetic towards the disgraced former executive.","Kraken CEO Jesse Powell <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jespow\/status\/1598444611177189376\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">called out<\/a> Bankman-Fried last week following the latter\u2019s appearance on a Twitter space, saying he was \u201Ccompletely full of shit about how margin trading works.\u201D","\u201CHe's saying that the whole exchange operated on a net account equity model and anybody could borrow anything (in any amount?) from client funds or from nowhere. That's not how it should work,\u201D Powell said.","The next day he added that he didn't believe Bankman-Fried set out to hurt people.","\"I think he just didn't care or he was recklessly overconfident.
