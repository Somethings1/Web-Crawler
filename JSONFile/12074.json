But large increases in hash rate and difficulty are unlikely until the market significantly recovers,\" Voell said.","The network's hash rate has also gone up by almost 5% since July 21, the date of the last update, according to data compiled by The Block Research.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/bitcoins-hash-rate-daily\/embed\" title=\"Bitcoin's Hash Rate (EH\/s, 7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Mining difficulty refers to the complexity of the mathematical process behind mining, during which miners are repeatedly trying to find a hash below a set level.
