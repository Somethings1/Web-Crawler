Terra was linked to Luna, a governance token, to keep the prices stable. Terra USD crashed in May, wiping out billions. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Terraform and Kwon marketed \u201Ccrypto asset securities\u201D to earn a profit, such as marketing Terra USD as a \u201Cyield-bearing\u201D stablecoin. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC said \u201CTerraform and Kwon repeatedly misled and deceived investors that a popular Korean mobile payment application used the Terra blockchain to settle transactions that would accrue value to LUNA. Meanwhile, Terraform and Kwon also allegedly misled investors about the stability of UST.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The agency filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;\u201CAs alleged in our complaint, the Terraform ecosystem was neither decentralized, nor finance. It was simply a fraud propped up by a so-called algorithmic \u2018stablecoin\u2019 \u2013 the price of which was controlled by the defendants, not any code,\u201D said Gurbir Grewal, director of the agency\u2019s enforcement division. &nbsp;<\/span>","The company and Kwon misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD when it depegged in May 2021 \u2014 before the token's fall in May 2022, according to the SEC's complaint. The company \"secretly discussed plans\" with an unnamed U.S. trading firm to buy \"large amounts\" of Terra USD to restore the value, the SEC said.&nbsp;","Kwon and the company led investors to think that Terra USD's peg was restored by the algorithm, when it hadn't been. It was done by \"human agents,\" the SEC said.&nbsp;","The SEC also mentioned in the complaint losses incurred by retail investors, including a pharmacist in California who borrowed $400,000 against the value of his home to buy Terra USD and a painter in Vermont who invested $20,000 in Terra USD to pay for his son's college education, before losing it all.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with additional details from the complaint.&nbsp;<\/em>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
