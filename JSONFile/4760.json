However, over the past year, there has been a shift in the development priorities of the team, according to a statement.","Instead of continuing with Edge, the focus will now be on the successor solution CDK, the firm's toolkit designed for the development of various Layer 2 ZK-Rollups \u2014 Layer 2 networks designed using zero-knowledge proofs. Chains deployed using the CDK are anticipated to be interoperable within a wide network.","Multiple projects, such as Immutable, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/262973\/okx-launches-new-zk-layer-2-network-x1-with-polygon-cdk\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OKX<\/a>, Astar, Canto, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241693\/palm-network-polygon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Palm Network<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221942\/gaming-project-aavegotchi-to-release-own-blockchain-with-polygon-supernets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aavegotchi<\/a>, IDEX, Nubank, and Manta Network, have shown interest in or have plans to use the Polygon CDK for the development of their Layer 2 networks.","\u201CPolygon CDK-deployed chains will be interoperable within a broader web of ZK-powered L2s in the CDK ecosystem, creating a single unified pool of liquidity. These are features that Edge does not support natively and require migration with significant modifications,\u201D Polygon Labs said in a statement shared with The Block.","The project currently utilizes two primary scaling methods: a sidechain called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/learn\/249532\/what-is-polygon-and-how-does-it-work-a-beginners-guide-to-matic-cryptocurrency\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygon PoS<\/a> and a zero-knowledge rollup network, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222950\/polygon-labs-unveils-zkevm-layer-2-scaling-solution\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">zkEVM<\/a>.","A major development focus for Polygon Labs is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/250944\/polygon-matic-upgrade\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2.0 upgrade<\/a>, an ecosystem comprising multiple chains enhanced with zero-knowledge capabilities. Slated for release in 2024, this ecosystem, powered by CDK, aims to integrate Layer 2 chains based on ZK rollups and facilitate cross-chain communication.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
