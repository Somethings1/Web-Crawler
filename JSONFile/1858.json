Each fake game version has its own website, Twitter and Discord accounts \u2014 creating the illusion of authenticity to trick unsuspecting victims, SentinelOne threat researcher Phil Stokes said in the post.","Written in Rust, the malware attempts to deceive victims through AppleScript spoofing \u2014 presenting password request dialog boxes with hidden answers to capture passwords. Sometimes, it also uses Chainbreaker, an open-source project to extract passwords, keys and certificates from macOS keychain databases.","\u201CAs soon as the victim launches these fake games and provides the \u2018installer\u2019 with a password, their data, passwords and crypto wallets are stolen,\u201D Stokes added.","The malware authors also appear to be testing their creation's behavior on Apple's upcoming macOS 14 Sonoma version, with around one-third of the identified Realst samples targeting the release, Stokes said.&nbsp;","While SentinelOne's security solution can detect and prevent all known variants of Realst, Stokes added, he urged users and security teams to remain vigilant as \u201CApple\u2019s malware blocking service \u2018XProtect\u2019 does not appear to [currently] prevent execution of this malware.\u201D","Given the rising popularity of blockchain games promising financial rewards, Stokes advised users to exercise extreme caution when encountering solicitations to download and run such games.","Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Block.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated to credit initial reports from \"iamdeadlyz.\"<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
