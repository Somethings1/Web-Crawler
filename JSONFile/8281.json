For scalability, it looks to back projects that will scale blockchains both horizontally and vertically. It will also invest in startups building interoperability solutions, privacy rails and UX products.","James Parillo, managing partner at Figment Capital, told The Block in an interview that more decentralized infrastructure is needed after the troubles in the crypto industry last year that saw the collapses of FTX, Celsius and BlockFi.","\"A number of centralized actors that were trusted ultimately failed us. And we'll continue to see that. So we truly believe that open, permissionless systems that are governed by communities and collectives are really the future,\" said Parillo.","Parillo said Figment Capital's unique value proposition is that it is an operator-investor, meaning it has the hands-on experience to help projects develop and scale. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/128058\/thoma-bravo-leads-110-million-funding-for-figment-at-1-4-billion-valuation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Figment<\/a> is one of the largest staking services providers, providing infrastructure to more than 40 blockchains.","The Figment Capital fund II has already made two investments \u2014 Skip Protocol and Primev \u2014 said Parillo.
