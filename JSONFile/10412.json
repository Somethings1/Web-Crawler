If someone knows who a wallet address belongs to, they can see its transaction history and continue to keep track of its transactions, such as which non-fungible tokens (NFTs) they have bought and what decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) they have joined.","Pseudonymity \u2013 and whether or not high profile people should reveal their identity \u2013 is a hot topic in crypto.

And so if you couple professional identity, other social identities along with like financial data, it allows basically more attack vectors for users.\u201D","If users get hacked, not only is all their crypto lost, but social identity and other credentials can be hacked as well, says Kim. \u201CSo we're adding a privacy layer on top of open blockchains like Ethereum and Solana and others to provide more privacy for users.\u201D","While the team, which is still less than 10 people and fully remote, is focusing on NFT ownership as a use case, it\u2019s also looking to expand into other use cases like anonymous peer reviews of DAO members, anonymous reviews of DAOs and other cases in Web2 like Twitter verification.","With this funding round, the company has raised a total of $4.4 million so far.","© 2023 The Block.
