The rules \u2014 packaged in the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) Bill \u2014 include expanding the definition of digital assets businesses, disclosure requirements for crypto staking activities and tighter requirements for stablecoin issuers.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Following FTX's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185083\/ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">collapse<\/a> last year, Bahamian authorities <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/198785\/bahamas-regulator-fires-back-in-ongoing-feud-with-new-ftx-leadership\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">came under repeated attack<\/a> from John Ray III, the man appointed to run the exchange after the resignation and subsequent arrest of founder Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;In legal filings, FTX's new management <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189688\/bahamas-regulator-defends-ftx-actions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> it had evidence the Bahamian government directed unauthorized access to the exchange\u2019s systems \"for the purpose of obtaining digital assets\" that should be controlled by FTX.
