Notably, Dan Tapiero's 10T Holdings, Qredo's Series A lead investor, is helping in these efforts, per the sources. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">10T Holdings did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Qredo is struggling because its business has declined. \"Qredo saw a monthly average of $2.5 billion of transactional activity in H2 2022 and through Q1 2023 \u2014 this activity has fallen, along with overall market activity, throughout the course of this year,\" a Qredo spokesperson told The Block. \"With this prolonged cryptowinter, Qredo has chosen to right-size its business and focus on the core areas of growth in web3 wallets and custody solutions.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Qredo was valued at $460 million in February 2022, when it&nbsp;<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/132899\/crypto-startup-qredo-fundraise-tapiero\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $80 million in Series A funding<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. At the time, the company had intentions of using the funds to drive growth through acquisitions, product development and geographic expansion. It remains unclear how all of that capital was utilized.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In September also, a Qredo spokesperson attributed job cuts to a \"prolonged cryptowinter,\" explaining that the company was \"right-sizing to focus on its core protocol and its web3 custody business.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Qredo's core offerings include its Layer 2 protocol, known as the Qredo Network, and a custody technique called distributed multi-party computation. \"With Qredo, there is no third-party custodian.

Qredo's venture capital investors include Coinbase Ventures, Avalanche, Kingsway Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The QRDO token has experienced a massive drop, falling nearly 100% from its peak price of $9.81 in November 2021 to current levels of around $0.03915180, as per CoinGecko data. The fully diluted valuation of the token stands at around $64 million.<\/span>","","","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Qredo's second round of layoffs comes as more crypto firms have been cutting jobs.
