That's what fashion tech firm DressX is betting on as it raises a $15 million Series A led by Berlin-based crypto venture capital firm Greenfield.","The round, which closed at the end of February, also featured participation from Slow Ventures, The Artemis Fund, Red Dao and Warner Music.&nbsp;","Co-founders Daria Shapovalova and Natalia Modenova declined to share the valuation in an interview with The Block but said it was an uplift from its previous $10 million valuation at seed.&nbsp;","At its founding in 2020, DressX looked at ways to incorporate on-chain fashion but decided it was far too early.&nbsp;","\"The concept of digital fashion was already ground-breaking and not easy for everyone,\" said Modenova. \"Adding another layer of difficulty and complexity here would definitely not help it take off.\"&nbsp;","In the meantime, it focused on off-chain digital fashion pieces that can be showcased on platforms like Roblox and Instagram. In the process, it racked up over 250,000 users on its app, where users can access a digital closet of bought items.&nbsp;","As the popularity of digital fashion picked up, DressX saw an audience emerge that understood web3 and began to dive deeper into NFTs, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.showstudio.com\/news\/dressx-finally-try-their-hand-at-the-world-of-nfts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launching<\/a> its marketplace in March last year and <a href=\"https:\/\/wwd.com\/fashion-news\/fashion-scoops\/dressx-digital-fashion-start-up-moves-into-nfts-with-crypto-com-partnership-1234903529\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">forging<\/a> a partnership with exchange Crypto.com \u2014 which <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dressxcom\/status\/1493602699019010060\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">included<\/a> an NFT drop of the Super Bowl outfits designed by fashion label Dundas for singer Mary J. Blige.&nbsp;","NFTs sold on its marketplace can be worn digitally in augmented reality via the DressX app or used as skins in metaverse games Ready Player Me or Decentraland.&nbsp;","Despite the focus on web3, the founders admit that their off-chain items are primarily the firm's bread and butter, with its NFT fashion essentially locked toward those who know their way around a seed phrase and a MetaMask wallet.&nbsp;","Moreover, digital fashion \u2014 let alone NFT fashion \u2014 is still very nascent. The industry's size was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/press-release\/digital-fashion-market-2023-market-size-increasing-demand-gross-margin-and-competitive-analysis-2023-2028-2023-02-02#:~:text=The%20global%20Digital%20Fashion%20market,USD%20195071.83%20million%20by%202028.\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">valued<\/a> at around $342 million last year, a small cut of the couture pie compared to the trillions that its physical counterpart is worth.&nbsp;","The funding will be used partly to improve the interoperability of its digital fashion assets and improve the performance of its app and NFT marketplace.&nbsp;","Last month, early stages deals such as FashionX's Series A showed an uptick since a sharp decline last October. The number of early-stage deals doubled from last month's eight to 15 in February, per The Block Research. Still, in terms of dollar amount, the average size of such deals declined.","","","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
