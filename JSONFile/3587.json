The attacker submitted a governance proposal via internal transactions, making it difficult for community members to notice.","This malicious governance proposal included an unverified contract designed to transfer control of Yam\u2019s reserves to a wallet address controlled by the attacker. The rogue actor was initially able to achieve a quorum for the proposal that was in danger of being passed before it was stopped by the Yam Finance team.","If the attack had succeeded, it would have been able to drain the Yam Finance treasury, which currently holds $3.1 million worth of crypto assets, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/deepdao.io\/organization\/5c76f492-c718-4c2e-b633-c9dbac1cc331\/organization_data\/dig_deeper\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a> from DeepDAO.","Yam Finance said the attack was similar to another attempt made in December 2021.","Saturday\u2019s attack came amid another governance tussle within the Yam ecosystem, also related to the project\u2019s treasury. The issue was another disputed governance vote \u2014 this time, a snapshot <a href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yam.eth\/proposal\/0x48be1e680491b50416595d0a9a9f3e4b233edbf6b9977623fda63b1b5af3d3fc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">vote<\/a> \u2014 that aimed to make the project\u2019s treasury redeemable at a pro-rata rate.","While the initial snapshot vote passed with more than a 54% majority, there are now calls for the process to be redone. Some community members have <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.yam.finance\/t\/yip-110-treasury-redemption-re-vote\/1700\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">submitted<\/a> a new proposal for a re-vote, claiming that the original process did not go through the usual governance procedures.","Yam Finance was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/74604\/yield-farmers-deposit-76m-in-unaudited-defi-project-in-less-than-an-hour\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">one of the projects<\/a> that emerged from the early DeFi boom in the summer of 2020.
