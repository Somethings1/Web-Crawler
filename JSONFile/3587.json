Baughman and Flemming found that these fluctuations were likely to push consumers towards more stable payment methods, thereby increasing demand for the stablecoin.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although the digital currency may not take over its component fiat currencies in popularity, if enough sellers accept it as payment, it would have a high level of \"spendability,\" the economists said.

That's because the same trade shocks might make the demand of the stablecoin volatile enough to cause the demand of its component currencies to become volatile as well.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Baughman and Flemming say this would make it nearly impossible for the basket-backed stablecoin to become an internationally dominant currency, thus concluding that \"fears of a so-called global stablecoin replacing domestic sovereign currencies may be overstated.\"<\/span>"],"hashtag":["FEDERAL RESERVE"]}
