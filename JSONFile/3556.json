While bitcoin revenue was $4.57 billion in 2020, up approximately 9x year over year, bitcoin gross profit was only $97 million, or approximately 2% of bitcoin revenue,\" Square said.","","","\"Bitcoin revenue and gross profit benefited from an increase in bitcoin actives and growth in customer demand, as well as a significant year-over-year increase in the market price of bitcoin,\" the firm said.","Square noted in its report that Cash App's active user ranks have swelled because of its bitcoin offering, accounting for some three million customers who purchased or sold bitcoin in 2020:","Square also said that it expanded its bitcoin holdings beyond the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/80175\/jack-dorsey-square-purchases-50-million-worth-of-bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$50 million<\/a> worth it purchased in October:","As shown in the chart above, Square's bitcoin offering has come a long way since its inception in early 2018 in terms of volume as well as public visibility.
