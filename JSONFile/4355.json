The first part did not appear in Grayscale's June filings for the above-mentioned trusts, CoinDesk pointed out.","The company did mention its contact with SEC staff in its June filings but said at the time that the regulator had not provided guidance on whether those cryptocurrencies were securities. An emailed request for comment was not returned by press time.","These disclosures provide insight into the current conversations happening between the SEC and crypto companies in the wake of increased regulatory oversight of the industry. In May, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2022-78\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SEC said<\/a> it would significantly expand the unit in charge of investigating securities law violations in the cryptocurrency space.","In July, the regulator deemed nine cryptocurrencies to be securities in an insider trading complaint against a former Coinbase employee and two others.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
