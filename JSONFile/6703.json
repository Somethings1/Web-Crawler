But competition is heating up in the custody world, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/05\/09\/bitgo-brings-on-trading-executive-to-solve-industry-pain-points-as-it-eyes-new-opportunities-to-lure-institutions-into-cryptocurrency\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">forcing BitGo<\/a> expand into new frontiers, having recently been eyeing the launch of prime-broker services.","But today's news reflects BitGo's ambitions to serve as the crypto world's version of the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) \u2014 which sits behind every trade in Wall Street. By providing a specialised clearing and settlement system, BitGo could be at the forefront of addressing one of the most underdeveloped and risky facets of crypto trading.","Currently, settling a crypto trade takes place by moving users\u2019 assets into hot storage. By doing so, their crypto is exposed to risks of a hack or counter-party defaulting. Because the settlement is done on-chain, ownership of the crypto is renounced before users\u2019 secure their payment (or vice versa), meaning the original owner absorbs any potential losses. Many believe this has been keeping institutions at an arm\u2019s distance.&nbsp;As such, the likes of Bakkt and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/over-20-crypto-heavyweights-put-heads-together-to-plan-institutional-uptake-clearinghouse-initiative-set-for-july\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Liquidity Offset Network<\/a> are working to address this gap, but it seems BitGo may now beat them to the punch.","By adding an Off-Chain Clearing and Settlement (C&amp;S) service to its custody product, BitGo says users\u2019 digital assets should remain safe throughout a transaction, as they will never leave custody before ownership is settled. In other words, BitGo acts as a trusted third party, locking up both parties\u2019 funds during settlement. The crypto is only moved on-chain during the withdrawal, by which point it is the new owner\u2019s responsibility.","\u201CUntil now, in a digital asset trade, one party needed to assume all of the risk and act on the counter-party\u2019s good faith, and this doesn\u2019t really work for institutional investors,\u201D said BitGo CEO Mike Belshe. \u201CWe are bringing to market a riskless, efficient, and compliant digital asset clearing and settlement.\u201D","Notably, the C&amp;S service will only be available to clients of its existing custodian business, adding a competitive edge. They are hoping to offer their services to a client base made up of OTC desks, single dealer platforms, exchanges, asset managers, and broker-dealers.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
