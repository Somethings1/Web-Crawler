Some firms have left, while others have relocated within Ukraine.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Now, many are returning to work, with varying success. And the nation, which recently passed a law aimed at cultivating the local crypto industry, is hoping crypto entrepreneurs will help it recover once peace is restored.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CNothing can happen as long as the war hasn\u2019t ended,\u201D says Mikhail Chobanian, CEO of Ukrainian exchange Kuna.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ukraine\u2019s native ecosystem of crypto firms is already remarkably well developed.

In fact, the firm had already begun evacuating much of its staff back in January.
