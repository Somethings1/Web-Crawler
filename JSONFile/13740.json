One of those sources suggested that the bulk of the funds are already committed and that the round, if closed, would value Chiru at between $300 million and $400 million. A fourth person with knowledge of the deal cautioned that the details are yet to be finalized, but will be soon.&nbsp;","Neither Chiru nor the project's pseudonymous founder Zagabond responded to requests for comment.","The news comes just a week after fellow NFT maker Doodles <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169601\/doodles-announces-54-million-raise-plots-hiring-spree\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bagged $54 million<\/a> at a $704 million valuation, in a round led by Reddit co-founder and NFT enthusiast Alexis Ohanian\u2019s venture capital firm 776.
