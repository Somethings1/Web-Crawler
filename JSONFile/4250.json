Genesis Global later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/204035\/genesis-owes-more-than-3-6-billion-to-top-50-creditors\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy<\/a> with more than $3.5 billion owed to creditors. By far the largest claim belonged to Gemini Trust Company, which was owed $766 million in funds that had been lent out through the Gemini Earn program.","Gemini and DCG <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-02-06\/dcg-bankrupt-crypto-firm-genesis-in-credit-accord-with-gemini-others\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reached an agreement<\/a> in February that would see DCG restructuring debts, as well as contributing equity in Genesis Global Trading, another unit, to its bankrupt lending arm, with Gemini contributing up to $100 million.","But there are still details to hash out. On April 21, the UCC presented a revised term sheet to DCG after an investigation.","In Friday\u2019s update, Gemini said the agreed-to mediation \u201Cwill be narrowly focused on DCG\u2019s economic contribution to the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of all creditors, including Earn users, and is designed to bring resolution to the Genesis bankruptcy plan.\u201D","Gemini said the mediation process will involve two meetings before May 8, adding that $630 million owed to Gemini by DCG is due by May 9-11. \u201CIf DCG is unable to pay and\/or restructure its debt, DCG risks defaulting on its obligations. So while the mediation is scheduled for up to 30 days, the parties are expected to work expeditiously towards agreement in the immediate window,\u201D Gemini said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
