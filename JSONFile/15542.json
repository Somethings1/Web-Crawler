The challenge for the industry could be in figuring out whether the high level of interest is going to help its cause.","\u201CThis data shows crypto is top of mind for voters in swing Senate states and that a pro-crypto position is a net positive for policymakers and candidates,\u201D concluded Julie Stitzel, senior vice president of policy at Digital Currency Group, which commissioned the polling and sees its results as positive.","About 14% of people in the online survey of registered voters own crypto right now, they said, and many more have a high awareness of the emerging financial technology. But fewer than one in three voters surveyed \u2013 31% \u2013 said they have positive views on digital assets, according to the snapshot of responses from people in Michigan, Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania and Arizona.","Those in the crypto-positive group who say they'll weigh crypto positions in their voting decisions represent about 13% of respondents. That leaves 8% who may not be as enthusiastic about policies friendly to digital assets \u2013 a split that may leave this year's candidates uncertain about which way to lean, despite industry hopes.","Though most of the swing-state voters \u2014 on whose shoulders the presidential selection and the congressional majorities could rest \u2013 may distrust crypto, even more of them think the current financial system is outdated (70%) and needs to be overhauled (74%). A significant 41% of them also granted that crypto may represent a path to financial security (41%).","More than two thirds of the respondents don't think federal officials \u2013 including the president and Congress \u2013 are up to the task of making good policy decisions on crypto.","Whatever side the voters land on, Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, noted in a statement that the poll demonstrates \"digital assets have emerged as a significant issue in the upcoming election.\"","The data suggests that as many as 47 million people may be holding digital assets, if 14% of the wider U.S. population also own crypto, which is a lot of voters to contend with. The survey indicates they represent a fairly close balance between the two political parties, favoring the conservative side a bit. The survey, though, suggested that pro-crypto voters may be slightly less inclined than others to show up to vote.","In another noteworthy finding, the survey results may also hint that the industry shouldn't count on a massive segment of the public waiting on the sidelines to invest in cryptocurrencies, with only 7% of those who don't own any saying they still intend to jump in. However, about half of the people said they'd be more interested if established, big-name financial firms were involved and also if the government puts protections in place.","Read More: Trump is Clear Favorite Among Crypto-Owning Voters in U.S. Presidential Race: Poll","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"Blockchain Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Michigan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kristin Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"21%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"31%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ohio","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"74%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"41%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Montana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"14%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Pennsylvania","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"13%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Arizona","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Senate","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Julie Stitzel","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Politics","poll","Election 2024","US Elections"],"authors":["Jesse Hamilton"]}
