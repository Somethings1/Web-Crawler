It has backed some of the sector\u2019s best known decentralized protocols, including Uniswap and Compound.","Unlike traditional venture capital investing, investors in DeFi projects tend to amass the native token of a protocol.","As a big backer of the mobile-first DeFi platform Celo, for example, a16z<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/115562\/celo-architect-rene-reinsberg-mobile-defi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> holds a cache of CELO tokens<\/a>. Tokens provide both a financial exposure and the means to influence the development of a project through participation in governance voting.","One method that has emerged to avoid too great a concentration of influence, and to help projects scale, is the delegation of tokens to partner organizations.","A16z has<a href=\"https:\/\/a16z.com\/2021\/02\/05\/on-crypto-governance\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> previously disclosed<\/a> that it has delegated tokens to student-run organizations, including Stanford Blockchain Club, Harvard Law Blockchain and Fintech Initiative, Blockchain at UCLA, and Blockchain at Berkeley.","But the practice has at times proven controversial. In July, Harvard Law Blockchain and Fintech Initiative<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/111185\/harvard-law-blockchain-initiative-uniswap-dao\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> received a $20 million grant<\/a> from the Uniswap treasury.","Chris Blec, founder of DeFi Watch, claimed that the proposal \u2013 which was subject to a vote by token holders \u2013 was decided largely by a16z delegates. He published<a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/12JZESGPKhRPyxhGKAqv4wJBMg4dlgJUs\/view\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> an open letter<\/a> to a16z calling for more transparency about how the company\u2019s delegation program works.","In a blog post published August 26, a16z shared more detail about its token delegation process, including a list of best practices; how delegates are assessed; legal mechanics; the makeup of the company\u2019s existing delegate network; and ideas for future improvement.","The investment firm wrote that delegation is an effective method of instigating \u201Cthe development of a higher-quality governing body over the long term.\u201D","A16z went on to write:","\u201CTo truly unlock these benefits though, a \u2018strong\u2019 form of delegation is needed. One that not only reduces surface-level concentration, but that also enhances the quality and diversity of the governing body. And perhaps most important of all, one that empowers each delegate to vote independently from the token holder, in whatever way they see fit.\u201D","One of a16z\u2019s more eye-catching proposed best practices concerns independence. Any sway gained by an a16z delegate over the direction of a DeFi would be a sham without clear boundaries, given that its power exists entirely on the munificence of the investment firm.","\u201CDelegates must be empowered to vote independently from the token holder. This is an essential property for any well-designed delegation program. At a minimum, this means that the token holder should not attempt to influence or dictate its delegates\u2019 participation in any way, either explicitly or implicitly,\u201D the company wrote.","The transparency proposal was also striking. A16z stated that it will become increasingly important to give DeFi communities access to information about \u201Cthe relevant parties, the terms of the underlying delegations, their relationships to the token holder, and more.\u201D","To that end, a16z has published a breakdown of its current delegate network for Uniswap and Compound.","The breakdown (embedded below) reveals for the first time that microfinance company Kiva and Mercy Corps, the NGO, have received tokens from a16z \u2013 alongside university groups, startups and crypto professionals.","Notably, the breakdown does not detail exactly how many tokens have been delegated to individual organizations. The Block asked an a16z spokesperson whether details of individual delegations would be published by the company, but did not receive a response.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: a16z<\/em>","Going forward, a16z stated that it will delegate tokens to a wider array of organizations and implement its delegation methodology for new protocols. The company also aims to continue developing the delegation framework.","\u201CUltimately, we are strong proponents of delegation and believe it has an important role to play in protocol governance. Our hope in publishing this framework is that it can serve as a useful starting point for others who are beginning to think about delegation and how to incorporate it thoughtfully,\u201D it said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
