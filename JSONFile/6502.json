Yet, he sees central bank digital currencies and tokenized deposits as essential for innovation in finance.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCBDCs replicate existing forms of money in a technologically superior way,\u201D Carstens <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bis.org\/speeches\/sp230222.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> in a speech at the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The Swiss-based global institution for financial regulators is also actively experimenting with tokenized deposits, which are meant to replicate the role of commercial bank money, he noted.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When it comes to stablecoins, however, the BIS top dog said that the events of the last year \u201Chave cast serious doubts\u201D on their reliability as a form of money.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The collapse of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin in May 2022 turned regulators\u2019 heads and broke down their already feeble trust in the non-governmental fiat-backed currencies.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Carstens still imagines that the technological developments from crypto will form the basis of the financial future. A \u201Cunified ledger\u201D would allow the different parts to work together \u201Cseamlessly.\u201D He noted that \u201CCBDCs and tokenized deposits would appear in separate partitions in the unified ledger. Because they share a common ledger, they can be brought together and used in an efficient way, through smart contracts.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Carstens also said, \"it is incumbent upon central banks to make sure they contribute to developing an infrastructure that meets these demands: if central banks do not innovate, others will step in.\u201D<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
