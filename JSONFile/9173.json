Coinbase signed a term sheet committing to that investment in March.","Zipmex has been courting investors in recent weeks as it attempts to raise around $40 million at a valuation of $400 million, according to one other person close to the talks. They added that Babel Finance may lead the round, but a spokesperson for Babel declined to comment.","A spokesperson for Zipmex said: \u201CWe are in process of raising Series B+ and are speaking to a range of investors. We have not finalized lead investors or valuation. We cannot comment on market speculation or rumors.\u201D","Founded by CEO Marcus Lim in 2018, Zipmex has already hauled in some $52 million in Series B funding \u2014 spread across investments of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesstimes.com.sg\/garage\/zipmex-raises-us41m-from-b-capital-and-others-to-grow-digital-assets-platform\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$41 million<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/exclusive-zipmex-bags-additional-11m-series-money\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$11 million<\/a> in September 2021 and March this year, respectively. Its existing investors include B Capital, TNB Aura, V Ventures, Bank of Ayudhya\u2019s Krungsri Finnovate, Master Ad and MindWorks Capital. The proceeds of those rounds were earmarked for boosting Zipmex\u2019s presence across Southeast Asia.","While legally headquartered in Singapore, Zipmex has deep roots in Thailand \u2014 where it has a digital assets exchange license issued by the Ministry of Finance, the local regulator. In December of last year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bangkokpost.com\/business\/2229747\/zipmex-mulling-asia-pacific-expansion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Bangkok Post<\/a> reported that Zipmex accounted for roughly a quarter of the turnover of the digital assets market in Thailand.","The company also has offices in Singapore, Thailand, Australia and Indonesia.","After going public through a landmark direct listing on Nasdaq in April last year, Coinbase is currently in cash conservation mode.
