On today's episode of The Scoop, Gutmann said this event could open the floodgates for insurance giants to get in on bitcoin.","\u201CYou are going to see a lot of dominoes fall after this,\" he said.","Based on the set of macro circumstances 2020 presented, insurance companies are starting to question whether they can go forward only buying corporate credit to make good on policies, according to Gutmann.&nbsp;","\"Over some number of years, it's hard for me to imagine it is not all of them [investing in bitcoin],\" he said. \"If MassMutual can get there from a diligence perspective so can the next one...It's definitely coming.\"","He also sees publicly-traded companies following in the footsteps of Square and MicroStrategy. Both firms allocated a portion of their balance sheets to bitcoin.&nbsp;","In Gutmann's view, these companies have a \"fiduciary duty to consider whether holding 100% of your assets in dollars is in the best interest of your shareholders.\"","\"Reasonable people can have different opinions about that, but I personally don\u2019t think only Jack and only Michael and no one else is going to do a cold analysis of that and not come to that conclusion,\" he said.","On today's episode of the Scoop, Gutmann also touched on:","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Listen to today's episode on Apple, Spotify, Google Play, Stitcher or wherever you listen to podcasts.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
