Prior to his death, photographer Jeff McCurry took a photo of Harambe, which became a popular meme.&nbsp;","In May 2021, on the fifth anniversary of his death, McCurry sold seven photographs of Harambe as one-of-one NFTs. In September, Kang purchased the first NFT of the collection and two months later <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Rewkang\/status\/1461993988592791555\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> that he would like to see it fractionalized.","Over two years later, the initiative is finally going ahead. Kang sold the 75% ownership of the NFT for $5 million and he will receive 25% of the fractionalized tokens. The remaining tokens will be distributed in an airdrop to other meme tokens \u2014 TRUMP, PEPE, MOG and TOSHI \u2014&nbsp;and will be used for providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges.","McCurry is also supporting the initiative. \u201C$HARAMBE is fractionalized by my 1-of-1 NFT of Harambe\u2019s most popular photo that has been viewed over 25 billion times,\u201D he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeffmccurry9\/status\/1766973665415958547?s=46&amp;t=Zg98JZyrZ-lJDdBCp_SPNg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">posted on X<\/a>. \u201CMay Harambe's memory live forever.\u201D","An NFT is fractionalized by locking the original NFT up in a vault and issuing tokens that each represent an equal proportion of the NFT. While it\u2019s easy to fractionalize an NFT, it\u2019s much harder to undo it. This often involves having a majority of token holders voting to turn it back into the NFT in exchange for a payout.","The DAO set up to support the initiative is called the Harambe DAO. The tokens will be used for governance purposes within the DAO. The DAO said it has donated $25,000 to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
