When you deploy a smart contract to a general purpose blockchain there are things you can't customize. Cosmos flips that on its head with dapp-specific blockchains, although it does come with the downside that you have to find your own validators. I think the future will probably feature both models depending on the needs of dapps, so Cosmos' launch for me is a pretty epic moment for crypto,\" Noon said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Playlist Founders Karen Katz and Steve Petersen are Stanford engineers and serial entrepreneurs with 2 IPOs, a $300 million exit, 36 patents, and over 10 years experience each in digital music.

Given Playlist is generating 10X the user engagement of other streaming services, we require very high transactions per second. Cosmos is clearly the best technology for enabling the next generation of transactions within our growing community of artists, curators, influencers and fans.\u201D<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
