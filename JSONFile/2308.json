Initially, users could search for a specific public address and view the wallet balance directly in the search results. This functionality has now been expanded to ENS domains, as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BrantlyMillegan\/status\/1770957528983052375\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noticed<\/a> by former ENS core team member Brantly Millegan.","This means that anyone can search an ENS domain in search results, and Google provides the wallet balance of the blockchain address associated with the domain, as well as the address itself. The data is sourced from Etherscan, and the balance is shown as of the last external transaction.","However, it appears that this service is not universally available. Some users on X noticed that it would not appear in search results. Millegan <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BrantlyMillegan\/status\/1770958426702581761\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> that the feature worked more consistently when using private browsing mode or when logged out of Google services."],"hashtag":["WALLETS"]}
