Treasury, the U.K.\u2019s finance ministry, on the case for tighter regulation of certain crypto ads.","Randell also highlighted the \u201Crisk of contagion of the regulated business of authorised firms by unregulated activities in digital tokens\u201D \u2014 seemingly in reference to mounting efforts by financial services firms to offer crypto trading to customers.","This point is particularly relevant to the fintech sector. Investment apps such as Freetrade, Plum and Trade Republic in Europe have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/103231\/trade-republic-neo-broker-crypto-trading\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recently committed<\/a> to building crypto tools, while the neobank Revolut <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/104266\/revolut-dogecoin-crypto-trading-tool\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">added Dogecoin<\/a> to its array of tokens in June.","\u201CIt\u2019s essential that the boards of FCA authorised firms can show how they have addressed the risks that unregulated activities in relation to digital tokens can pose to those firms: to both their conduct, and their prudential soundness,\u201D said Randell.","The FCA currently maintains <a href=\"https:\/\/register.fca.org.uk\/s\/search?predefined=CA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a register<\/a> of crypto-focused companies that meet its anti-money laundering requirements, as well as an interim list of applicants awaiting approval. It <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fca.org.uk\/news\/press-releases\/fca-bans-sale-crypto-derivatives-retail-consumers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">banned the marketing of crypto derivatives<\/a> to retail investors in October 2020.","But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/109841\/uk-fca-binance-ban-derivatives-spot-trading\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a recent tussle<\/a> with global crypto giant Binance demonstrated the difficulties the watchdog faces in policing the sector via traditional means. Indeed, the FCA conceded in a memo in August that it was \u201Cnot capable\u201D of supervising Binance.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
