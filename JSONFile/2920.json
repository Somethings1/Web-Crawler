The successful completion of this live transaction between Lightnet Group and SEBA Bank is a major milestone on our journey to make these kinds of services available to the masses.\u201D","The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/85526\/velo-protocol-powering-the-worlds-premiere-federated-credit-exchange-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FCX<\/a> is a unique distributed network with regulated entry points that connects an array of traditional, centralized and decentralized finance partners. Standing firmly in the Federated <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/veloprotocol\/these-are-words-that-go-together-well-terra-joins-the-fcx-a19486a371bc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Finance<\/a> category, the FCX combines the efficiencies and freedom of DeFi with the well-worn, mature practices and standards of CeFi and legacy systems. It is this approach that makes it possible for the FCX to enable the liquid exchange of digital credits pegged to any fiat currency while guaranteeing last mile settlement using the VELO token.","To participate in Velo Labs\u2019 Federated Credit Exchange Network, there are several stipulations to which all network participants must abide. These include:","One major advantage of Velo Labs\u2019 FCX is that it allows network participants to transact using digital credits pegged to the fiat currency of their choice. SEBA Bank, headquartered in Switzerland, decided to transact using Swiss Franc-pegged digital credits (vCHF). Lightnet Group, for their part, chose digital credits pegged to the United States Dollar (vUSD). In other words, the first ever transaction executed on Velo Labs\u2019 FCX used a vUSD\/vCHF trading pair!","","","The 1st transaction flow worked as follows:","","","To completely settle the transaction, SEBA Bank and Lightnet Group can, at any time, each revert their vUSD and vCHF to VELO tokens -- the same asset that they used to initiate the transaction. It is in this way that VELO tokens act as both a bridge asset and as the FCX\u2019s universal collateral.","With this first transaction out the way, the Velo Labs team is turning their attention to onboarding more partners from the legacy finance, CeFi and DeFi worlds. The ability to aggregate liquidity from these different worlds, while simultaneously providing off-chain order matching and on-chain trade settlement and clearance, positions Velo Labs\u2019 Federated Credit Exchange Network as one of few blockchain projects with a clear path towards mass adoption.","The <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/veloprotocol\/these-are-words-that-go-together-well-terra-joins-the-fcx-a19486a371bc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Federated Finance<\/a> era has arrived.
