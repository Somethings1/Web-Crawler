The sources remained anonymous in exchange for leaking non-public information.&nbsp;","The investigation centers around USDT passing through the Moscow-based exchange Garantex. The U.S. and UK <a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy0701\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sanctioned<\/a> Garantex in April 2022 for allegedly enabling money laundering, terrorism financing and ransomware attacks.","Both nations hope to tamp down on illicit efforts to support the Russian war against Ukraine through the investigation. However, Bloomberg's sources note that it's too early to foresee conclusions or that Tether's parent company committed any wrongdoing.&nbsp;","Garantex remains one of many entities that U.S. regulators sanctioned in an effort to tamp down on Russian war financing. On March 25, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control penalized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284582\/us-treasury-sanctions-13-entities-for-aiding-russian-sanctions-evasion-via-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">13 entities<\/a> and two individuals allegedly aiding Russian nationals evade sanctions using cryptocurrency, The Block previously reported."],"hashtag":[]}
