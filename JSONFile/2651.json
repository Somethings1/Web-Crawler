And it\u2019s very different from what was anticipated. The <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/libra\/libra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/libra\/libra\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">code is open source<\/a>, transactions will be pseudo-anonymous and even though it is a permissioned blockchain to start, it is set to transition to permissionless over time. What\u2019s most important, though, is that Facebook will have little role in governance. A new Facebook subsidiary, Calibra, will be one of the 100 validating nodes and won\u2019t have more than 1% of the voting power.","So as long as you don't use Facebook\u2019s custodial wallet, and instead use one of the non-custodial wallets that will inevitably be developed, Facebook won\u2019t know who you are or who you are transacting with. And that\u2019s very similar to how other public cryptocurrencies function.","If you do decide to use Facebook\u2019s Calibra wallet then there are no guarantees. And I wouldn\u2019t trust Facebook with my financial data. The statement on Calibra\u2019s website reads:","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> \u201CWhen you authorize a payment, we share data with third parties necessary to process that transaction. We also share Calibra customer data with managed vendors and service providers\u200A\u2014\u200Aincluding Facebook, Inc.\u200A\u2014\u200Athat support our business (e.g., to provide technical infrastructure or direct payment processing). In both cases, we share only the Calibra customer data that is necessary for completing the defined activity or service\u201D <\/span>","But then again, no one is forcing you to use Facebook\u2019s wallet\u200A\u2014\u200Athat\u2019s the beauty of open source.&nbsp;","This is not to say that Libra will be censorship resistant\u200A\u2014\u200Ait is still a permissioned chain where everyone knows the identities of the validating nodes. Libra Association says that in the event of a legal judgment, \u201Claw enforcement would be able to work directly with nodes to screen out the bad address.\u201D But the Association wouldn\u2019t be able to force movement of the bad actor\u2019s Libra.","All in all, Libra was a nice surprise. Its success is not guaranteed; not even close. But let\u2019s stop the baseless FUD. Meanwhile, I look forward to following the new developments.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":[]}
