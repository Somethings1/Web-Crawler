He also holds British citizenship.&nbsp;","\u201CI would like to make clear, publicly, what I\u2019ve felt privately from day one: war is never the answer,\u201D Storonsky wrote in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.revolut.com\/a-personal-letter-from-our-ceo\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an open letter<\/a> published late on March 1. He described the war as \u201Cwrong and totally abhorrent,\u201D and called for an immediate end to the fighting.","Revolut\u2019s other co-founder and CTO Vlad Yatsenko, who is Ukrainian, had already <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vyatsenko\/status\/1496783800025632768\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">publicly condemned<\/a> the actions of Russian president Vladimir Putin after he ordered his forces to invade Ukraine on February 24.","Revolut itself had also <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.revolut.com\/the-war-on-ukraine-our-response\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">taken action<\/a> by helping customers donate to relief efforts in Ukraine through its app, while waiving fees for transfers to Ukraine.","In his letter, Storonsky said that Revolut users had donated more than £1 million to Red Cross Ukraine\u2019s appeal within 24 hours \u2014 and pledged that the startup would match every pound, euro, złoty or franc donated over the next 7 days, up to £1.5 million.","Some of Revolut\u2019s more than 2,150 staff are based in Russia and Ukraine, and Storonsky said in his letter that he had to consider the wellbeing of those based in Russia before making any statement on the war.","\u201CThey have done nothing wrong; they have simply helped build Revolut, supporting their own families through their hard work, just like their colleagues in Ukraine (or London or New York or Sydney or Mumbai, or anywhere else in the world where our people are based). I was, and remain, mindful of them in all of my actions,\u201D he said.","Since the war in Ukraine began, fintech remittance firms such as Wise, Zeps, TransferGo and Remitly have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/135875\/more-fintechs-follow-wises-lead-in-suspending-transfers-to-russia\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suspended their services in Russia<\/a>.
