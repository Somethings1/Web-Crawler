{"summary":"Digital money is becoming the go-to vehicle for serving people recovering from disaster. But when those in need have no smartphones or bank accounts, aid organizations have to distribute cash more creatively. That\u2019s why Sempo is one of CoinDesk\u2019s Projects to Watch 2023.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/consensus-magazine\/2023\/04\/17\/humanitarian-aid-transformed-crypto-startup-sempo\/","publishDate":"2023-04-17T12:15:26","id":16067,"type":null,"title":"Sempo Delivers Cash Aid for the Unbanked in Crisis","category":["Consensus Magazine"],"content":["Humanitarian aid has undergone a radical transformation in the last decade because non-governmental organizations (NGO) have largely reduced their efforts for giving out in-kind donations \u2013 such as food, clothing, and medical supplies \u2013 in times of crisis. Now, cash is making up an increasingly large portion of all humanitarian aid.","Cash, unlike in-kind donations, lets recipients make their own choices about when and how to care for themselves and their families in emergency situations.","However, distributing cash aid comes with its own challenges. Moving physical cash around can be difficult and dangerous, especially in the aftermath of natural disasters. Other issues \u2013 like corruption or currency devaluation \u2013 can also be a problem.","Digital cash transfers can make things easier, but not everyone who needs aid has a bank account \u2013 or access to the internet. Crypto has been floated as a potential solution to these issues, but how can crypto serve disaster victims who do not have smartphones, bank accounts, or internet access?","Read profiles of all of the Projects to Watch 2023: Reclaiming Purpose in Crypto","Sempo was started in July 2017 by a pair of young Australians entrepreneurs, Tristan Cole and Nick Williams.","Their inspiration was a Web 2 humanitarian aid distribution platform called GiveDirectly, which allows donors to send cash to people living in poverty.","\u201CWhat they do is give people money in Africa and other underserved communities,\u201D Cole said. \u201CThey raise funds in places like Australia and the United States \u2013 all over the world \u2013 and they give people money. And for me, I found that very interesting.\u201D","Cole pointed out that 90% of money sent through GiveDirectly goes to beneficiaries.","\u201CWith traditional NGOs, it\u2019s not that at all,\u201D Cole said. Overhead costs and administrative fees for traditional donation methods can eat up as much as 30% of the cash value. \u201CI was, like, why can\u2019t we do this with Oxfam or any of these other NGOs?\u201D Cole said when he and Williams reached out to humanitarian aid organizations, they found that the organizations were struggling with major technological challenges in running their cash transfer programs.","\u201CThere\u2019s no infrastructure in the places we work,\u201D Cole said. \u201CLike, in Vanuatu, the banking infrastructure isn\u2019t great. Most people are unbanked who actually need the assistance. So that\u2019s what really inspired me. I\u2019m very interested in how we can do more financial empowerment for others \u2026 there\u2019s still so many people who don\u2019t have access to things that we take for granted.\u201D","One such thing is access to the internet, which is a major challenge for many projects Sempo works with. Other crypto-native aid distribution programs, like Stellar Aid Assist, require the internet to function. But blockchain-powered Sempo has an option that doesn\u2019t require the internet to function. Instead of sending crypto between beneficiaries and local merchants, beneficiaries can instead use a tap-to-pay card that doesn\u2019t require an internet connection.","\u201CThe pay card is used by Oxfam as well as others,\u201D Cole said. \u201CIt's used in places that maybe have lower levels of digital literacy, lower financial literacy and ultimately, places that don't have great internet infrastructure because it can work offline at times, which is the real key selling point there.\u201D","The project went through several accelerators in Australia and the U.S., including dlab, an early-stage crypto accelerator. Between all the programs, Sempo\u2019s founders raised approximately AU$450,000 \u2013 a little over US$300,000.","\u201CIt's pretty much been bootstrapped the whole way,\u201D Cole told CoinDesk. \u201CJust Nick and myself funding it, and revenue from customers.\u201D Williams left Sempo in 2021, according to his LinkedIn profile.","Sempo\u2019s core infrastructure was made open source in 2019, which means organizations that want to run projects on Sempo don\u2019t need to pay for the privilege of doing so \u2013 something that was important to Cole, who wanted to make the software accessible to organizations helping people in need. There are a number of organizations, including the Red Cross, who use the open-source software for free, said Cole.","However, if organizations aren\u2019t tech savvy enough to set up and run the project on their own using Sempo\u2019s free tutorials, they can use Sempo\u2019s hosted model, paying Cole a software service fee and consulting fees to get their help designing and running the project.","\u201CIt\u2019s much more hand-holding from the start of the program \u2013 the ideation phase all the way to monitoring, evaluation and then scaling it up,\u201D Cole said of the hosted model.","Eventually, once a project is set up, it can transition to an unpaid, self-run project, which happened with the Red Cross and another project called Grassroots Economics, Cole said. He said he is currently working with Oxfam to help it transition its hosted project to a self-run project as well.","Cole\u2019s ambition for Sempo is to eventually help all projects transition to a self-hosted model.","\u201CIt\u2019s a part of growing up \u2013 you have to learn to let go,\u201D Cole said. \u201CThe best transition for [Sempo] was to move to just a fully open-source model because it\u2019s the purpose of working with nonprofits.\u201D","Edited by Jeanhee Kim."],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nick Williams","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Williams","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US$300,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nick","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NGOs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sempo\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Australia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Red Cross","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sempo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"July 2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"last decade","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Vanuatu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jeanhee Kim","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tristan Cole","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cole","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Grassroots Economics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sempo]","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NGO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Oxfam","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the U.S.","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Crypto projects 23","humanitarianism","Blockchain"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
