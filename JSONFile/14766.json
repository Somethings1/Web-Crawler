This could be the case in Europe where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forbids information about individuals being shared willy-nilly.","One way around this is by avoiding putting data on a blockchain at all and instead replacing it with proofs about that data. This is what zero-knowledge proof technology does: one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know some secret information, without conveying anything at all about the information.  ","\u201CYou can have a person prove their credentials and reveal them to the right people and fully retain control of who gets to learn what, and still have that in a notarised blockchain with all the security that it provides,\u201D said Jonathan Rouach, co-founder and CEO at QEDIT.","Antonio Senatore, chief technology officer of Deloitte\u2019s EMEA Blockchain Lab, said that validating, managing and recording the education qualifications of staff and prospective hires can be a very onerous and costly process for most organizations, with regulatory fines for non-compliance. ","\u201CIntegrating QEDIT\u2019s Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy solution ensures that organizations can trust in the authenticity of qualifications, while preserving the full privacy of the underlying data, and upholding regulatory compliance,\u201D he said in a statement.","As well as complying with GDPR, Rouach pointed to particular instances where ZKP would be helpful, such as an individual who has switched careers might want to be selective in what information can be shared about them. ","\u201CFor example, a person is going to prove that they have a security certification from some IT school, but then they also learned statistics for gamblers. So when they go to apply to a bank, they would like to show that they are proficient in security but not anything else they might have acquired in their education,\u201D Rouach said. ","The event in Amsterdam, billed as Europe's first dedicated zero-knowledge event, is being organized by QEDIT and Deloitte and taking place in the latter\u2019s offices. Also appearing are the likes of ING Bank and Facebook\u2019s Calibra. ","The goal is to bring the ZKP community together with industries looking to use the technology and drive standards.  ","\u201CZKPs are moving fast and companies that want to deploy it don\u2019t have experts to say what are the most mature and trusted implementations,\u201D Rouach said.","Image via CoinDesk archives"],"entity":[{"type":"Facebook\u2019s Calibra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rouach","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Amsterdam","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"ZKProof Community Event","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ING Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Deloitte\u2019s EMEA Blockchain Lab","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Deloitte","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jonathan Rouach","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Antonio Senatore","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Education","Privacy","Identity","News","Deloitte","Digital Diplomas"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
