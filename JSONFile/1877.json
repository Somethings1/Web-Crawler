Lau has backed projects including Nansen, Trader Joe, and Mixmob. He was also an early Solana investor.","\u201CI talked to a few projects recently, like just this week, and they were telling me like how even though these VC\u2019s were committing to the round a month ago, two months ago, they\u2019re pulling out of the deals based on how the market looks right now,\" Lau said on the most recent episode of The Scoop.","They're also being much more selective compared to previously. \"So back then a lot more VC\u2019s were spraying and praying,\" added Lau.","The \"spray and pray\" approach \u2014 which involves an investor making a bunch of bets on the hope that one will deliver a massive upside \u2014 appears to be becoming less of a darling strategy in today's market.","Says Lau: \"People are being more careful with their capital.\"","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On this episode of The Scoop, Lau and Frank Chaparro discuss:&nbsp;<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
