He mentioned that the IRAs have been the ones buying into the bitcoin ETFs as they are immediately able to do so. As for the major platforms, these need to approve the products internally through their due diligence processes before making them available.","Hougan described this as a series of small passageways that need to be navigated before most of the wealth in the US can invest in these newly launched products. He stated that the major wirehouses supporting the ETFs could increase their availability by around four times.","His comments match those by Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/282348\/bitcoin-etfs-likely-to-see-two-massive-catalysts-by-the-end-of-the-year-says-etf-expert\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told The Block recently<\/a> that the two major catalysts for the bitcoin ETFs would be their availability on wirehouses \u2014 as well as the development of options products based on them.","Balchunas said the ETFs should land on those platforms within the next few months. \u201CIt's like putting a product on the shelf of Whole Foods or a big food store. Just that kind of exposure and availability is only going to help,\u201D he said.","Balchunas added that in addition to wirehouses, other large investment platforms like Raymond James and LPL could facilitate broader access to ETFs. He also noted that many smaller platforms might follow suit.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
