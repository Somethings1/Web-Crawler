The crypto sector has faced increased scrutiny in the U.S. since the downfall of FTX. Prosecutors have alleged that FTX engaged in fraudulent activities that harmed its users.","Notably, the CCTV broadcast also mentioned the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233154\/sec-files-suit-against-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lawsuit<\/a> by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission against Binance and Zhao in March \u2014 similar to the SEC's but focusing on the sale of crypto derivatives. It is not immediately clear whether CCTV covered the CFTC lawsuit also in March.","","","CCTV rarely covers crypto-related news, which makes this broadcast appear significant \u2014 capturing wider attention. The outcome of the lawsuit could have wide-ranging implications for the regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies.","Last month, CCTV broadcast a segment about cryptocurrencies that featured the Bitcoin logo \u2014 a \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232404\/beijing-web3-white-paper\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">big deal<\/a>,\" according to Binance's Zhao, as \"historically, coverages like these led to bull runs.\"","The segment featured what appeared to be a Bitcoin ATM in Hong Kong. Besides a large blue Bitcoin logo, an option that said \"Buy Bitcoins\" was visible. NFTs were also highlighted in the segment \u2014 which has since been taken down.","Â© 2023 The Block.
