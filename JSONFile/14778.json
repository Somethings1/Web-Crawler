Meanwhile, the spot market volume suffered a relatively measured drop of 32.6% to $2.01 trillion.","\u201CThis decline followed unexpected macroeconomic data, an escalation in the geopolitical crisis in the Middle East, and negative net flows from U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, leading to major crypto assets retracing the gains they made in March,\u201D CCData said in a report shared with CoinDesk.","Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell nearly 15% to under $60,000 last month, snapping a seven-month winning trend. The sell-off came as an overheated bull market ran into broad-based risk aversion characterized by renewed tensions in the Middle East, dwindling probability of rapid Fed rate cuts this year and strength in the dollar index.","The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the most liquid digital assets, traded nearly 20%, and the total crypto market capitalization slipped by 16.8% to $2.177 trillion.","While Binance remained the largest crypto exchange by volume, its combined spot and derivatives market share fell to 41.5%. The exchange\u2019s spot market trading volume tanked 39.2% to $679 billion in April, recording the first decline since September 2023.","\u201CThe decline in Binance\u2019s market share also coincided with the news that its founder and previous CEO, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to four months in prison for the violation of U.S. money laundering laws,\u201D CCData noted.","Binance CEO Changpeng \u201CCZ\" Zhao stepped down after pleading guilty to U.S. criminal charges in November and was replaced by Richard Teng. Since then, Binance\u2019s spot market share has increased from 30.8% to 33.8%, CCData said.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"41.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.01 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"32.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Changpeng Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$9.12 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4.57 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Richard Teng","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"30.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"47.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2.177 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Middle East","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$60,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"39.2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$6.58 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"43.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"16.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"33.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$679 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"September 2023","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Cryptocurrency","Trading Volume","Markets","Ccdata"],"authors":["Omkar Godbole"]}
