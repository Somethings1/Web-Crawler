After successfully raising $4.2 million in its seed round,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.geniusyield.co\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Genius Yield<\/a>&nbsp;is now launching its Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO). More than 75 million ADA (worth almost $100 million at the time of writing) have already been delegated into the now four dedicated stake pools, a record number when it comes to similar projects on Cardano.","\"We launched 2 pools 2 weeks ahead of the start of our ISPO and started seeing incredible numbers really fast. We added 2 more as we were nearing the launch to avoid saturation. While we\u2019re confident in our team and what we\u2019re building, seeing our community rising to the occasion by delegating so much so early is encouraging. It means that what we\u2019re trying to achieve really resonates with people.\"","Dr Lars Brünjes, Genius Yield\u2019s CTO and Director of Education at IOHK - the company building Cardano.","For people who are new to the ecosystem, here\u2019s how you can participate to the ISPO:<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n1. Buy ADA on your favourite exchange<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n2.

New investors should not delegate to GENS1 anymore as it\u2019s already fully saturated: new delegators will not earn GENS rewards while earlier delegators will not be affected.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nGENS1, GENS3, and GENS4 pools reward 100% in GENS, while GENS2 rewards 50% in GENS and 50% in ADA. The maximum capacity of each pool is 64 million ADA.","","","While the world of DeFi provides many investment opportunities, managing capital is both complex and time-consuming for most users. That is why Genius Yield is building an all-in-one solution that enables users to benefit from advanced algorithmic trading strategies within an intuitive, hassle-free, and secure platform.","Users will be able to deposit the tokens of their choice and customize their investment strategy based on a number of factors: expected returns, fees they\u2019re willing to pay, risk tolerance, when to take profits, and so on. Genius Yield\u2019s AI-powered Smart Liquidity Management protocol will then maximize their yields while minimizing risk exposure.","In addition to that, the team is also working on launching its Genius Yield Academy in the coming weeks.","\"We believe knowledge is power, hence why we\u2019re building a community-driven educational and mentorship platform that teaches DeFi concepts and supports everyone in their journey towards financial freedom.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n-Dr. Sothy Kol-Men, co-founder.","Genius Yield ISPO basics:<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nStart date: December 15th, 2021<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nEnd date: June 15th, 2022<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nGENS Rewards: 10 Million GENS<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nRunning for 36 Epoch (1 epoch = 5 days) &nbsp;","Accumulated GENS rewards will be airdropped to the delegator\u2019s wallet after the Token Genesis Event (time of minting). ADA holders will be able to delegate their funds to a stake pool in exchange for staking rewards. To participate in the ISPO you will simply need to delegate to Genius Yield\u2019s\u2019 stake pools.
