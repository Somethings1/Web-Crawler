This is based on Chainalysis's monitoring of on-chain data.","Last week, bitcoin\u2019s price slid considerably from $49,000 to a low of $30,000, at one point <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/105317\/bearish-crypto-market-bitcoin-ether\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wiping out<\/a> $3.3 billion in liquidations during a single hour.","The market intel report concurs with The Block\u2019s reporting that hedge funds and asset managers were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/105377\/hedge-funds-asset-managers-bitcoin-price\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">buying the dip<\/a>, particularly in bitcoin\u2019s $30,000 - $35,000 range.","According to Chainalysis\u2019s report, this price crash saw a considerable amount of bitcoin being moved on-chain at a loss. Gradwell stated that 1.2 million bitcoin was sent at a 5 - 25% loss, with 120,000 bitcoin moved at a 25% loss or worse.&nbsp;","\u201CHowever, this was a smaller number of bitcoin sent at loss than in the late 2017 and mid-March 2020 price crashes, suggesting that last week was not the worst capitulation of holders in bitcoin\u2019s history,\u201D he said.","","","When measured in U.S. dollars, however, the losses stacked up. The report noted that $3.2 billion was sold at a loss last week, coins that had only been acquired 4 - 13 weeks earlier. In fiat terms, it was \u201Cthe worst week ever for bitcoin investors.\u201D","It was a similar picture for Ethereum. Last week witnessed the most amount of ether ever moved at a loss. The report stated 22.6 million ether was sent at a 5 - 25% loss. On the flip side, Gradwell noted that, \u201Cwhile people took losses on Ethereum, they were not extremely large in percentage terms.\u201D","According to the report, the price of bitcoin has now returned much closer to its average purchase price over the last year. Gradwell noted that the average purchase price was $37,800, a number that bitcoin fell below but has recently broken back above.","","","The economist said that historically, prices for both bitcoin and ether have often returned to this cost price and that it typically provides a floor, except for the crypto winter of 2018.","For ether, the average purchase price over the last year is $1,700, a price it has not returned to during this crash. Currently, at $2,830, the price of ether is $1,130 higher than this level.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
