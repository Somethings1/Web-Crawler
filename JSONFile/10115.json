Polygon declined to comment on Banerjee's departure.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/141116\/polygon-releases-testnet-plans-for-a-new-scalability-focused-blockchain-called-avail\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygon initiated the Avail project in late 2020 and introduced it publicly in mid-2021<\/a>. Avail is a modular blockchain that allows developers to build customizable and scalable applications. Unlike monolithic blockchains \u2014 such as Ethereum and Solana \u2014 modular blockchains break down the essential functions of consensus, security, data availability and execution, and handle them separately.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"This enables developers to design fast, efficient, and scalable applications,\" Avail said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The project hopes to cater to standalone chain developers as well as scaling projects with its platform.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> \"Blockchain development is a very niche space due to various complexities that involve spinning up a chain, and it shouldn't be,\" Banerjee said. \"That's why we want to offer a robust and secure data availability API so that chain developers can bootstrap security in minutes and concentrate on business and execution logic.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Avail is currently live on a testnet and its mainnet is expected to launch around the fourth quarter of this year, according to Banerjee. There are currently 20 people working on the project. Last month, the entire Avail team at Polygon moved to the new entity.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While Avail is currently under development by the team, it intends to create a not-for-profit body called the Avail Foundation in the future and eventually hand over governance to a community. That suggests Avail could launch its own token, but Banerjee declined to comment.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
