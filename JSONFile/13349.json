{"summary":"Despite advancing, the bill&#x27;s prospects of becoming law are now in doubt after negotiations broke down, and a tense, marathon legislative session on Thursday.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241852\/stablecoins-bill-advances-in-us-house-after-tense-day-of-debate","publishDate":"2023-07-27T22:15:02","id":13349,"type":null,"title":"Stablecoins bill advances in US House after tense day of debate","category":["POLICY"],"content":["The House Financial Services Committee passed a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S., but along party lines after longterm bipartisan negotiations around the bill broke down.","House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241749\/us-stablecoin-talks-stall-as-senior-house-republican-blames-white-house\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blamed the White House<\/a> for the impasse, while committee Democrats argued Republicans were rushing the process.","The bill was approved by the committee by a vote of 34-16, with a handful of Democrats bucking their senior members on the panel, in addition to unanimous Republican support for the legislation. The vote was similar to a vote yesterday in the panel to advance the crypto market regulatory overhaul.","Democrats protested the vote on the bill earlier in the day through a series of procedural maneuvers to slow down proceedings, while saying that Republicans could wait to vote on the bill until September or later. A bipartisan compromise on the bill looked likely as recently as earlier this week. It remains to be seen whether talks could be revived to give the bill a substantial chance of becoming law.","A separate crypto-related measure around self-custody also advanced past the panel on a party-line vote, indicating it is unlikely to advance into law due to the split control of Congress.","Â© 2023 The Block.
