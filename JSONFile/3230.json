David Scott, D-Ga., the top Democrat on the committee that Behnam testified before. The Agriculture Committees in the House and Senate hold jurisdiction over the CFTC, since the majority of commodities futures are crop-related.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The CFTC has asked for an approximately 10% increase to its annual funding, from $365 million to $411.14 million, but the agency has long fought for more money with limited receptiveness from Congress. Legislation that would create a pathway for digital assets to become commodities would also give the CFTC more authority than it currently has to regulate them directly.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Last year\u2019s collapses of FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and Terra-Luna hastened the urgency felt by regulators and policymakers to increase guardrails around digital assets in case the market grew to a size where it could affect the rest of the U.S. and global financial sectors. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To that end, House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn 'GT' Thompson, R-Pa., and House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232983\/republican-draft-bill-would-create-new-definition-of-decentralized-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">new legislation<\/a> last week. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If passed into law, the legislation would grant more authority to the CFTC as well as direct the SEC and CFTC to create a more defined pathway for digital assets to become commodities.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe need the policing authority to proactively go after these individuals,\u201D said Behnam, emphasizing that digital asset markets could grow again after a post-FTX pullback. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf it starts to peak and move into a direction of growing you could potentially have financial stability risks and other concerns for financial markets.\"<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
