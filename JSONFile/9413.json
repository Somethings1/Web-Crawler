Sunstock, Inc., (D. Mass, 1:18-cv-12568, Doc. 1, 12\/13\/18) [SDP]<\/strong><\/em>","Are spelling errors and improbable claims in marketing materials a sign that an investment idea might be more fluff than stuff? Put differently, if something sounds too good to be true does that mean that it probably is?","This new lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court alleges a long series of misrepresentations made by a company that the plaintiffs invested several hundred thousand dollars into, culminating in claims about an ICO that the plaintiffs say they never agreed to allow their investment to be used for.","It\u2019s a very long complaint with numerous causes of action, including federal and state securities claims, common law claims and an unfair trade practices count for good measure. Several alleged material misrepresentations are at issue:","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">* That the defendant had plans to build a \u201Crecession based portfolio\u201D with \u201Cplans to divest up to half of its cash proceeds in SILVER BULLION\u201D<\/em><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">* That defendant fraudulently claimed that it had launched a \u201CRehabilitation Housing Division\u201D<\/em><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">* That it planned to \u201Cacquire a portfolio of undervalued real estate using an exciting and novel combination of stock and crowdfunding based financing.\u201D Specifically (and in underlined italics, for emphasis) Defendant stated that \u201C[t]o achieve the Company\u2019s objectives, Sunstock, Inc. is seeking $20.9 million in total funding in 5 trenches.\u201D (Yes, trenches. Not tranches. Which suggests that no lawyer ever read that language).<\/em><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">* that instead of buying real estate or silver, the Defendants decided to invest \u201Ctime, energy and the Plaintiffs\u2019 money in \u2018Triple 8\u2019 crypto tokens.\u201D<\/em>","Per the lawsuit, the defendant described Triple 8 as \u201Ca user friendly and valid monetary system. Redefining how the world uses and understands money flows, the launch of \u2018Triple 8\u2019 as asset-back [sic.] crypto currencies, tied to gold, silver and platinum bullion provides real world value, not seen since the loss of the U.S. dollar monetary gold standard.\u201D The lawsuit quotes press releases by defendant saying that after \u201Cmonths of due diligence\u201D the defendants had decided to run an ICO using a company called Flashmoni to raise $10 million and naming an \u201Cinternationally acclaimed blockchain strategist\u201D as an advisor to management.","[related id=2]Plaintiffs say that the planned ICO was a terrible use of loan money, a securities transaction that they never agreed to be a part of. While we have to read through the lines to figure this out, it seems like part of the impetus for this lawsuit is the fact that the Defendant defaulted on loan payments, which caused a default. It could be that this caused them to scrutinize the defendant more closely and become worried that they were associated with an ICO.","Lessons to be learned here? If someone offers you a chance to invest in an investment \u201Ctrench\u201D probably stay away unless it has something to do with a sewer system. I also suspect that is not the last time we will see ligation over a token offering that claimed to put precious metals on a blockchain.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
