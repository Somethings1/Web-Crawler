The initial deal saw Lee presell BXA tokens worth $25 million to BK Group as part of the acquisition process. These tokens were also sold to investors to the tune of about $45 million.","However, Bithumb did not list BXA and this allegedly led to significant losses on the part of investors. These investors sued both Lee and Kim Byung Gun, chairman of the BK Group, in court for fraud. South Korea\u2019s investigative agency previously determined that Kim did not have a case to answer. Investigators concluded that Kim was as much a victim as the other investors in the BXA token sale.","Now, prosecutors are asking for Lee to be convicted of fraud, according to South Korea\u2019s Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. \u201CThe amount of damage is very large, and the damage is especially great for ordinary coin investors,\u201D said the prosecution at a Tuesday hearing before the Seoul Central District Court.","Lee\u2019s defense, however, argued that the token sale was in accordance with a \u201Ctypical stock sale contract.\u201D The defense further argued that BK Group\u2019s Kim was trying to avoid criminal responsibility for his part in the BXA token sale debacle.","The court will hold its sentencing hearing on December 20.","Â© 2023 The Block.
