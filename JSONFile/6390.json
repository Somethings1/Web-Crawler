The platform had allowed users to purchase so-called \u201CSuperchargers,\u201D which generate yield and can be sold back to the company.

We will therefore need to see significant inroads into the losses before that can happen, and that will take time,\u201D Freeway said.","The company says it will initiate a four-pronged recovery plan. Steps include using a \u201Ccontrolled environment\u201D to maintain \u201Cthe management and growth of remaining funds,\u201D a new diversification strategy and starting an \u201CEarn and Protect\u201D program. Freeway also said it plans to deploy \u201Cmajor new funding in a totally new product,\u201D but did not offer more details because the funding is not finalized.","Â© 2023 The Block.
