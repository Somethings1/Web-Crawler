Instead, it centers on user controls and three-factor authentication (3FA).","\u201CBecause ensuring secure (and simple) self-custody remains a centerpiece of the crypto industry, we developed Legacy Transfer to offer a multi-chain inheritance-style solution for cryptoassets,\u201D the team wrote.","Rather than relying on a single point of failure with traditional private keys, Zengo\u2019s infrastructure divides the responsibilities of private key generation and signing between the user\u2019s device and its servers. These components are secured through Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) cryptography.","Since the shards are never stored in one location, this scattered approach enhances the security of the digital assets, providing better resilience against theft when compared to traditional single-point-of-failure private key wallets.","A <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ZenGo-X\/public-docs\/blob\/main\/Zengo%20Legacy%20Transfer%20White%20Paper.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">whitepaper<\/a> outlining the technical aspects of the Legacy Transfer feature has been released by the Zengo X Research Team. Led by co-founder and CTO Tal Be\u2019ery, the paper explains how the system leverages non-KYC, inheritance-style asset transfer methods.","Zengo is one of the leading MPC wallet providers, alongside firms like Fireblocks, Coinbase, Web3Auth, and others.","Â© 2023 The Block.
