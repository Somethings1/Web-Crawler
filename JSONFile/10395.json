The web3 space is unique because vulnerabilities in code can result in a direct loss of funds. As such, the incentives to exploit projects in web3 are significantly larger, primarily due to the amount of capital held in smart contracts, the Immunefi team explained.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The highest bounty Immunefi paid in 2022 was the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/148085\/wormhole-announces-10-million-bug-bounty-payout\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$10 million<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> award for a vulnerability discovered in Wormhole, a generic cross-chain messaging protocol.
