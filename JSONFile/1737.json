So there's a tremendous amount of dialogue around it,\u201D said Sprecher.&nbsp;<\/span>","Following its underwhelming inception, Bakkt recently witnessed a jump in the trading volume of its physically-settled monthly bitcoin futures, hitting around $10.25 million on Oct. 25.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Sprecher, Bakkt\u2019s fast advance into the options market is looking to be among the first that offers the space transparent price discovery. As Sprecher pointed out, the current options market for bitcoin is active but murky. Meanwhile, Bakkt\u2019s derivatives platform can act as a source of price discovery independent of unregulated cash markets, bringing more transparency to the space.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSo it lends itself very nicely to an options market where people trade options and hedge with the underlying can have perfect hedging in one venue that they know is transparent. So that was the pressure to get the options out quickly,\u201D said Sprecher.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Regarding Bakkt\u2019s plans in the consumer payments space, Sprecher said that the move stemmed from the belief that bitcoin will be both a payments method and a store of value, similar to gold.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe don't think that, that whole space will be relevant and grow unless there are real use cases. And we do, as you pointed out, think that a use case is going to be digital transfer of value through payments,\u201D said Sprecher.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Earlier this week, Bakkt <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/44872\/bakkt-to-launch-consumer-app-in-first-half-of-2020-will-test-product-with-starbucks\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that it will launch a cryptocurrency consumer app and merchant portal in the first half of 2020, in partnership with Starbucks.
