TGT \u2014 whose directors include Yield App Co-founders Justin Wright and Jason Corbett \u2014 is currently making efforts to wind down its portfolio and gain control of its assets, including a $22 million claim against FTX, according to the FT report.","Tyr did not immediately respond to The Block\u2019s request for comment. Tyr said in the media report that it could not comment in detail given the ongoing investigations.","In April 2023, TGT filed a criminal complaint against Tyr with the Swiss prosecutor for criminal mismanagement. The prosecutor carried out a search at the fund manager\u2019s office and seized documents in August \u2014 according to the FT article, which cited a source familiar with the matter.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX lawyer Andrew Dietderich <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/275405\/bankrupt-ftx-wont-be-restarting-but-former-customers-will-get-money-back-in-full\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told a judge last month<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that FTX plans to repay former customers in full but it has abandoned plans to restart the exchange.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThat payment in full is based on the petition date values of those claims,\u201D the lawyer added. \u201CMany of those claims are premised upon currencies, which declined dramatically in value in that tumultuous period leading up to the petition date.\u201D<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
