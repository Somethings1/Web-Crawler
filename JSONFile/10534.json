Compared with second-quarter 2021, bookings \u2014 referring to the platform's virtual currency, \"Robux\" \u2014 were down 4% to $639.9 million, making the results posted lower than the $644.4 million expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.","Overall however, daily active users (DAU) hit 52.2 million, up 21% year-on-year, while hours engaged were 11.3 billion, an increase of 16%, the company said on Tuesday.","\"We are now at peak numbers globally for users and hours, and in the US\/Canada \u2014 the absolute level of users and engagement hours in July exceeded those of any prior month even during the peak lockdown periods of the pandemic.

As a result, we continued to hire aggressively in [the second quarter] and expect to do so for the balance of this year and likely into 2023,\" Roblox stated.","The company will hold a webcast to further discuss its second-quarter results on Wednesday morning at 8:30 a.m. EST.","Â© 2023 The Block.
