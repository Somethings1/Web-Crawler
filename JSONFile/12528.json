Tokenized fund issuance by both traditional institutions and crypto companies backed by such securities grew to over $800 million on public blockchains by the end of 2023 from $100 million at the start of the year, according to the analysts.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Issuance of tokenized funds backed by government securities on public blockchains.

Moody\u2019s argues that in the absence of widely accepted stablecoins or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), tokenized money market funds could be used as an alternative to stablecoin collateral in DeFi markets, though they may not be as liquid.","In November, SC Ventures, the investment and innovation arm of Standard Chartered, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263035\/standard-chartered-sc-ventures-tokenization-libeara\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> a tokenization platform called Libeara. Last week, SGD Delta Fund, a tokenized Singapore-dollar government bond fund, received an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270304\/moodys-rates-first-fund-to-use-standard-chartered-units-tokenization-platform\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AA rating<\/a> from Moody's after becoming the first fund to use Libeara.","Last week, Nomura's Laser Digital also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/271230\/nomura-laser-digital-unveils-polygon-powered-libre-protocol-brevan-howard\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">unveiled<\/a> Polygon-powered Libre protocol for Brevan Howard and Hamilton Lane funds.","Similar to traditional bond funds, tokenized funds typically invest in fixed-income long-term instruments, such as corporate or government bonds, or in short-term securities, such as bills and notes, the analysts said. However, the key difference lies in their digital nature, with shares of the fund represented as digital tokens on a distributed ledger, replacing centralized shareholder registers.","This enhances market liquidity and accessibility, decreases costs and enables fractionalization for traditional investors but also offers significant benefits to crypto investors \u2014 particularly in a high-yield environment where traditional assets become more attractive compared to volatile returns in DeFi, the analysts said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">30-day weighted average lending rates on Compound v2 versus 3-month US Treasury yield.

However, tokenization also introduces additional complexities, requiring a much more diverse range of expertise, the analysts said.","Service providers in this space often have limited track records, increasing the risk of payment disruptions due to technological failures or bankruptcy. The exposure of fund collateral to stablecoins adds another layer of risk. Furthermore, the use of public blockchains in tokenized funds introduces vulnerabilities to additional technological risks, cyberattacks and governance issues, the analysts argue.","While the allure of tokenized funds is currently high, this interest might also diminish if there is another crypto bull market. Ultimately, despite the promise of technology-driven efficiencies, the framework supporting tokenized funds is still evolving, with a need for further development and standardization, Moody\u2019s said.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
