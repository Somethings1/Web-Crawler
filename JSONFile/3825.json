It is not yet clear how they were able to gain control of the account. It was promptly deactivated once the breach was discovered and is now back online.","The Sandbox told The Block that to their knowledge only one user was scammed and that they were working with him to \"solve his situation.\"","\"The trust of our community is paramount for us and we are taking steps to further secure our social accounts. We are currently reviewing our security logs and internal processes to reinforce security across all of our platforms,\" the company said.","The <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xd6daa97d455d67e1f786429bd130db56de2ed479#tokentxnsErc721\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hackers\u2019 wallet<\/a> shows it holds four NFTs transferred from two wallets following the Instagram breach. Among them is one World of Women Galaxy NFT.","NFT phishing scams are common on social media.

After agreeing on a price, they convince their target to link their wallet to a scam trading site that then relieves them of its contents. In May, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/148750\/hackers-steal-29-moonbirds-valued-at-1-5-million-in-nft-phishing-attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">29 Moonbirds worth $1.5 million were taken<\/a> in this way.","Blue tick accounts are a particularly attractive&nbsp; for hackers in the hopes that the appearance of being official will trick more people.","\u201CThis event serves as a reminder that we must never let our guard down. Because of our profile, hackers and phishers will constantly try to test us. However hard they try, we\u2019ll work even harder to keep your accounts \u2014 and ours \u2014 secure,\u201D said The Sandbox.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
