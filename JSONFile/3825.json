By 2021, it said it was already profitable. In 2020, the firm raised $4 million in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/71863\/ethereum-based-gaming-startup-sorare-raises-4-million-in-seed-funding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">seed funding<\/a> before going on to raise a $5o million <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/96034\/nft-marketplace-sorare-raises-50-million-series-a-led-benchmark\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">series A<\/a> and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/118094\/fantasy-soccer-nft-sorare-scores-680-million-raise-softbank\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$680 million series B round<\/a> led by SoftBank in 2021.&nbsp;","The platform enables soccer fans to trade NFT cards of popular players powered by the Ethereum blockchain. It operates much like other fantasy sports websites. More than 120 football clubs have launched player NFTs on the platform.","While the platform does not have any clear gambling functionalities, the price of player NFTs can be driven by a team's performance. In that way, users can engage in speculation based on game performance.","It is unclear if this amounts to gambling in the eyes of the Gambling Commission. In 2017, the Gambling Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk\/news\/article\/gambling-commission-warns-fantasy-football-organisers-to-not-get-caught-out\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">warned<\/a> fantasy soccer organizers that they could require a pool betting license from the regulator. In this case, private pools and pools not run in the course of a business were exempt. According to the commission's website, that notice was updated on Feb. 8, 2021, though it isn't clear what changes were made to the content.&nbsp;","Sorare told The Block in a statement that due to the nascent nature of the technology, regulatory questions are expected. It is \"very confident\" that it does not offer any forms of regulated gambling, said Sorare.","\"This has been confirmed by expert legal opinions at every stage since the company was founded, including during a number of fundraising rounds,\" a representative for Sorare told The Block in a statement. \"We will always engage and have an open dialogue with authorities who reach out to us to learn more about our game.\""],"hashtag":["SORARE"]}
