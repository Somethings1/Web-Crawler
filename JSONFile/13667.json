But while the change should make paper currency transactions easier in theory, Venezuelans will likely still turn to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/restofworld.org\/2021\/venezuela-digital-payment-adoption\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">digital <\/span>alternatives<\/a>&nbsp;<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u2014 including stablecoins \u2014 to protect their savings.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The new so-called Bolívar Digital, which went into effect on Oct. 1, changes the way Venezuela\u2019s Bolívar currency is expressed but not the actual value. So, an item worth 10 million Bolívars is now displayed with a price of 10 Bolívars.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To help people wrap their head around how this works, Venezuela\u2019s central bank has added an overlay on its website that pops up to show the old bills versus the new ones. On the left-hand side, the image shows five, individual bills for<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> one million <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bolívars (together worth about $1.20 under the previous version of the currency, VES).&nbsp; Now, those five bills are represented by a single, five Bolívar bill. Under the new currency, bills will have denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 Bolívars.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This is not the first time in recent years that Venezuela has reconverted its currency. The country stamped out five zeroes from the Bolívar in 2018 after taking away three in 2008, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/americas\/venezuela-subtract-six-zeros-currency-second-overhaul-three-years-2021-10-01\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reuters<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> pointed out. Industry experts cited by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International\/wireStory\/hyperinflation-us-dollars-pricing-venezuelan-consumers-79402145\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ABC News<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and others estimate that more than 60% of transactions in the country are in dollars.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So, why is Venezuela chopping off the zeroes? Well, as prices go up, sometimes it can be hard to put them into context. Right before the reconversion, the Bolívar was worth about 10 times less than it was a year earlier, said Nevin Freeman, CEO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/holareserve\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reserve<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The company has a wallet app popular with Venezuelans, who use it to save in dollars via the Reserve stablecoin (RSV), make deposits or withdrawals in other currencies and send remittances.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAt some point, the numbers get so big that they start to feel meaningless,\u201D Freeman said. \u201CThe hope is that by removing the zeros, consumers will be able to add up how much a basket of groceries costs in Bolívars again.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But Freeman told The Block that the ongoing inflation in Venezuela is driving an uptick in transactions involving U.S. dollars, including stablecoins pegged to the currency.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMany transactions today happen in cash USD, electronic USD bank transfer systems like Zelle, and increasingly more are happening with USD stablecoin platforms like Reserve,\u201D Freeman said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In addition to dollars providing a more stable way to save than inflation-prone currencies, Freeman pointed out that Bolívar-based transaction methods can pose issues when transaction limits aren\u2019t updated in time to reflect the currency\u2019s loss of value. When this happens, it can be difficult to make everyday purchases with a single payment method. The latest Bolívar reconversion should help that for now, he added, but could happen again if the currency continues to lose value.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The reconversion was a \u201Cscary moment,\u201D Freeman said, noting that the Bolívar\u2019s value dropped more than 25% against the dollar in the two days prior before regaining 20% of its value since.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reserve decided to keep its app running despite the volatility, with Freeman noting in a video on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/holareserve\/status\/1443639174804934658?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that the company\u2019s liquidity providers were losing money by keeping the market open right before the change. <\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
