However, higher NFT sales may help attract new users to Ethereum.","","","In March and during the recent NFT boom, OpenSea sales and ether increased in tandem, according to Coin Metrics. During other times, such as in May, the ETH price peaked while NFT sales on OpenSea plummeted. ",""],"entity":[{"type":"$69 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bored Ape Yacht Club","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.22 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Pudgy Penguins","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"933%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ethereum blockchain","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["NFTs","Non-Fungible Tokens","OpenSea"],"authors":["Frances Yue"]}
