The firm also owes depositors $2.8 billion more in crypto than it's currently holding.","Celsius <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/157491\/crypto-lender-celsius-declares-chapter-11-bankruptcy-in-new-york\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">entered<\/a> Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month after cascading crypto prices forced it to halt withdrawals. Since then, it's been working its way through a restructuring process and examining ways to pay creditors. Early in the process, documents <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/157647\/celsius-bankruptcy-documents-claim-1-2-billion-balance-sheet-gap\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">showed<\/a> a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet, with the firm reporting $4.3 billion in assets and $5.5 billion in liabilities.","Now, it appears the firm's financial standing has gotten worse.&nbsp;","It still has about $130 million in cash balance as of August, but that's set to run out by October. With all current operating, capital and restructuring expenditures, Kirkland &amp; Ellis projects the firm will be nearly $40 million in the red by the close of October.","Monthly Cash Flow Table from Kirkland &amp; Ellis filing","Still, the greater hole is in its crypto holdings. The firm reported significant gaps between assets held and liabilities in the filing, amounting to a $2.8 billion hole in crypto liabilities. The firm currently has $348 million in BTC on hand, with $2.5 billion in BTC liabilities. There's about a $1 billion spread between ETH liabilities and ETH on hand, and a little less than $700 million gap in USDC liabilities. Little to no WBTC and stETH liabilities and holdings of $557 million and $683 million respectively make up a little ground, along with an additional $438 million in its native CEL token after disbursements. The lender also has a gap of $625 million in other coins.","Coin Report from Kirkland &amp; Ellis filing","The figures were filed ahead of the firm's second day hearing, which is scheduled for tomorrow at 2 p.m. EST. A meeting of creditors will also occur on August 19.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
