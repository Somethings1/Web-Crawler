Volumes across popular NFT marketplaces have failed to recover from a precipitous drop earlier this year.","Historically, Solana-based NFTs have only made up a small segment of the overall ecosystem for non-fungible collectibles and digital art, with the largest projects such as Bored Apes Yacht Club and Pudgy Penguins first minted on Ethereum.","\"I remember once upon a time (last year), that 'some people' laughed at Solana NFTs,\" noted Chase Barker, head of developer ecosystem at the Solana Foundation, on Twitter.&nbsp;","\"It's so true. It felt like cold calling\u2014a lot of people not taking Solana NFT space seriously,\" Metaplex co-founder Stephen Hess told The Block in a phone interview.","Historically, the low barrier to entry has meant that low-quality collections could copycat more legitimate projects at a lower price point.","\"The last few weeks we've seen a breakthrough in credibility, however,\" said Hess.","\"We were able to make a compelling pitch on the cost structure: creators on Metaplex can mint 1 million mints at a time for 50 SOL,\" he added referring to the upcoming roll-out of a new program for creators.&nbsp;","Currently minting through Metaplex costs $0.30.&nbsp;","Dust Labs \u2014 the project behind NFT collection y00ts and popular collection DeGods \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/09\/06\/nft-software-company-dust-labs-raises-7m-during-y00ts-release\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> earlier this week a $7 million fundraise and <a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslam.io\/y00ts-mint-t00b\/sales\/summary\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">saw $9.6 million in secondary sales<\/a> in September of its&nbsp;\u201Cy00ts mint t00b\u201D collection.
