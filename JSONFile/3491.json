Not to be outdone, the National Football League, the U.S.'s most popular sport, partnered with Mythical Games to create a blockchain-based game where players can collect NFTs.","Scott Lawin, CEO of Candy Digital, the company that runs a marketplace where fans can collect MLB non-fungible tokens, said his company abandoned the word \"NFT\" long ago.","\"I don't think we've used the term NFT for over two years,\" he told The Block. \"In terms of a brand 'non-fungible token' doesn't roll off the tongue or help people understand what it's all about.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
