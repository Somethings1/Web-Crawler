And as bizarre as some may seem \u2014 considering the vast majority provide no utility \u2014 some investors can\u2019t resist the urge to buy in. If you\u2019re one of those curious traders who are on the hunt for a good memecoin deal, we have the scoop for you. Similarly, if you want altcoins to watch, stay with us. This article covers the top meme coins and altcoins <strong>trending for 2024. <\/strong>","A <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/meme-coins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">meme coin<\/a> is a cryptocurrency that is inspired by an online meme. These types of coins are usually promoted on social media via influencers and celebrities. <strong>Many meme coins are produced as a joke, and most do not offer any utility or real-life value. In addition, they are highly speculative, meaning they come attached with plenty of risks.<\/strong>","When meme coins come to mind, most people likely think of <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/how-to-buy-doge-in-2021-a-guide-for-beginners\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dogecoin<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/shiba-inu-burn-rate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shiba Inu<\/a>. However, many more similar cryptos have appeared since the market witnessed extraordinary gains with some of these top meme coins. ","There are currently more than <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto.news\/meme-coins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">340 meme coins<\/a> <\/strong>trading in the cryptocurrency market. The top meme coins, according to market capitalization, include Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (<a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/shiba-inu-explainer\/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glossary-only-link\">SHIB<\/a>), Pepe (PEPE), and Floki Inu (FLOKI). With the exception of PEPE, these are all themed around the doge meme. Despite there being a tonne of memecoins on the market, only a few are worth trading. ","Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to lead the cryptocurrency market, holding 52.3% and 16.6% of the market share respectively. Meanwhile, meme coins are emerging as significant players, representing both memes and symbols of community-led achievements within the crypto arena.","The following coins were chosen for various factors, including market capitalization, popularity, and overall project success. We have included both memecoins and altcoins (alternative cryptos) in this list.","This project intends to build a community around its native token, $WSM, by providing members with exclusive benefits to reach<strong> a $1 billion market cap. <\/strong>","Some of these benefits include access to an upcoming merchandise store featuring caps, mugs, and clothing.<strong> This token was inspired by the infamous Gamestop short squeeze, in which the underdogs challenged Wall Street\u2019s stronghold. <\/strong>It is part of a launch by that same movement, utilizing an already built-in and engaged community. The project\u2019s creators describe its move to <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/blockchain-tokenization\/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glossary-only-link\">tokenization<\/a> as a symbol of the retail movement\u2019s resistance to Wall Street\u2019s orchestrated monopoly on financial markets.","<strong>The Chimpzee crypto sustainability project, notable for its meme coin format, recently announced the complete sell-out of its token sale.<\/strong> Chimpanzee ($CHMPZ), a platform operating in the web space focused on impact, declared an impressive <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/coin-burn\/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glossary-only-link\">token burn<\/a> of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techopedia.com\/chimpzee-announces-additional-epic-2-billion-token-burn-throughout-vesting-period-before-january-11th-exchange-launch#:~:text=Update%20%E2%80%93%20the%20Chimpzee%20token%20sale,burn%20during%20its%20vesting%20period.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2 billion during its vesting period.<\/a>","<strong>An <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/altcoin-season\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">altcoin<\/a> as opposed to a meme coin, Chimpzee was born from its team\u2019s desire to prevent animal extinction and ensure environmental progression. <\/strong>The project has already helped plant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/Chimpzee_new_green_web3_project_reaches_goal_to_plant_over_1000_trees_to_restore_Brazilian_rainforest\/prweb19315970.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">over 1,000 trees<\/a> to restore a rainforest.

And it has earned that title since it sits in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (<strong>$8.7 billion<\/strong>). Dogecoin made its debut in 2013, initially intended as a joke about the doge viral meme featuring the <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/shiba-eternity-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Shiba<\/a> Inu dog logo. Yet, with its unique twist on its branding and marketing campaign, the coin quickly received a massive social media following.","Doge notably rose to fame in 2021 following a price surge from <strong>$0.00268<\/strong> to its all-time high of <strong>$0.7316<\/strong>. The project\u2019s success was largely due to online hype, as celebrities like Elon Musk began promoting the coin.

We anticipate Dogecoin maintaining its relevance in the cryptocurrency market for the foreseeable future.","<strong>Based on data from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/shiba-inu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CoinGecko<\/a>, Shiba Inu\u2019s market capitalization currently stands at $5.52 billion as of January 2024. <\/strong>This substantial market cap indicates that the asset holds significant value in the eyes of the market.","Soon after, Shiba Inu was dubbed one of the few \u201Cdogecoin killers\u201D for its ability to outperform the king of meme coins. More recently, the project has gained the market\u2019s attention for announcing a<a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/layer-2-scaling-solutions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> layer-2<\/a> plan to expand its ecosystem.

","Launched in April 2023, pepe (PEPE) quickly rose to the dizzying heights of meme coin fame. The iconic Matt Furie\u2019s \u201CPepe the frog\u201D meme inspired the logo. Currently, Pepe Token (PEPE) holds the #2169 position on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/pepe-token\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CoinGecko<\/a>, with a market capitalization of <strong>$1,548,335. <\/strong>This market cap is calculated by multiplying the token\u2019s price with its circulating supply, which stands at 900 million tradable PEPE tokens.The team describes it as the \u201Cmost memeable meme coin in existence.","PEPE experienced a price surge of more than 4,000x back in 2023 that only showed testament to its enduring support.

While the year\u2019s full story remains to be seen, current trends suggest that the coin is on a bullish path.","<strong>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/floki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CoinGecko<\/a> as of Jan. 22, 2024 FLOKI is trading at $0.000032 (FLOKI\/USD), witnessing a 10.87% increase in the last 24 hours. <\/strong>The real-time updated FLOKI to USD price comes with a market capitalization of $307.72 million USD and a 24-hour trading volume of $78.53 million USD.

According to just daily trading volume, TAMA has managed to stay in the top 10 meme coins on the market. ","It\u2019s easy to get swayed by social media influencers when a new meme coin or altcoin is promoted. However, since many of these coins do not provide real-world value or utility usage, they should be traded cautiously. Although there have been success stories regarding these types of trades, most people end up losing money. This is because many of these coins derive value from social engineering. They also are the most prone to pump-and-dump schemes, which makes them extremely volatile.","<strong>However, this doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t some solid projects and money-making opportunities, including the coins and tokens in this list. Always make sure you study a project well and practice good risk management. <\/strong> ","Get guaranteed bonus up to $200 on Coinbase in 3 easy steps\n\n\t  ","Yes, DOGE is one of the most successful meme coins in the cryptocurrency market. A couple of software engineers created the coin in 2013 and branded its logo using a popular meme of the Shiba Inu dog coupled with its misspelled word \u201Cdoge.\u201D Its all-time high was in 2021 when the price peaked at $0.74 following an Elon Musk tweet.","Meme coins are cryptocurrency coins that have been created and inspired by popular memes. Currently, there are over 340 meme coins trading. The most popular meme coins are dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB) and pepe (PEPE)).

They differ from standard cryptocurrencies by having a whimsical or comedic essence, with their market value often swayed by social media buzz and celebrity backing.
