The idea was to create a way for developers to buy testnet ether in a more convenient way than the traditional approach of using faucets or asking the testnet's developers for coins. Still, critics warned that monetizing the native currency of a testnet \u2014 which is designed to have no value, allowing the network to support pre-production testing \u2014 would render it less suitable for its main purpose.","\"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This is the start of the end of Goerli testnet.
