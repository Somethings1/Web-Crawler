He claims the exchange\u2019s celebrity boosters didn\u2019t do their due diligence to check whether they may be breaking the law before cutting TV and digital ads for FTX.&nbsp;","\u201CThe one person I found that did that was Taylor Swift. In our discovery, Taylor Swift actually asked them, 'Can you tell me that these are not unregistered securities?\u2019\u201D Moskowitz said. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/2b0601e2-d371-404d-8531-227f11d4a83f\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Swift reportedly<\/a> came close to inking a $100 million sponsorship deal with FTX, but the partnership never materialized. Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","On the other hand, billionaire Twitter honcho Elon Musk did have a comment.","I\u2019m not surprised. Taylor is smart and her father is a well-regarded investment banker.","<script async=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/script>","Moskowitz is leading several class action lawsuits targeting the promoters of major crypto companies, including the now-bankrupt firms FTX and Voyager Digital. On March 31, the Moskowitz Law Firm filed a class action against influencers who have promoted Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange.&nbsp;","The case targeting FTX celebrity promoters had been stalled for months as the firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/226583\/shaq-served-ftx-class-action\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">struggled to serve O'Neal<\/a> with official notice that he was being sued. It took three months and process servers in several states to track him down, despite the fact that O\u2019Neal is a fixture on \u201CThe NBA on TNT\u201D and is a touring DJ.","\u201CThe largest man on the planet, we can\u2019t serve,\u201D Moskowitz said. \u201CIn my 35 years of doing class action work, I\u2019ve never had this issue before.\u201D","Moskowitz went as far as to send a complaint to the sheriff\u2019s office where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orlandosentinel.com\/features\/gone-viral\/os-ae-shaquille-oneal-broward-auxiliary-deputy-0318-story.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">O'Neal is a sheriff\u2019s deputy<\/a> in Central Florida in an attempt to serve him. The office allegedly cashed Moskowitz\u2019s $50 check but did not serve O\u2019Neal.","\u201CThey cashed our $50 and they said, \u2018Sorry, we haven't been able to serve him,\u2019\u201D Moskowitz said. O\u2019Neal didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.","The class action lawsuit claims that O\u2019Neal and other celebrities promoted the sale of unregistered securities. The plaintiffs in the case are using a particularly broad Florida law in the case that prohibits the promotion of unregistered securities, and does not require the promoter to have been deceitful to be sued. &nbsp;","\u201CYou promote an unregistered security for financial benefit, you are liable for all the rescissory damages,\u201D Moskowitz said.&nbsp;","For his part, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/12\/15\/shaq-on-crypto-ftx-post-collapse-i-was-just-a-paid-spokesperson.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">O'Neal has said<\/a> he\u2019s staying away from crypto after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November, less than a year after he appeared in advertising for the firm.&nbsp;","Moskowitz, who specializes in class action lawsuits, said he hopes celebrities and influencers are more careful about boosting crypto companies in the future.","\u201CI mean, why would you possibly promote cryptocurrency if it may be an unregistered security? That's just baffling to me,\u201D Moskowitz said. \u201CThere's a long list of influencers that promoted this. But you know, you\u2019ve got to be realistic. I mean, I can't go after 1,000 right now. So you go after the largest ones.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: This story has been updated with Musk commentary.<\/em>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
