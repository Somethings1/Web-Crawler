This could allow developers to create fast SNARK-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/learn\/251459\/what-is-a-layer-2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Layer 2 solutions<\/a>, according to the firm.&nbsp;","The team says that Jolt is \"up to 2X faster\" than the current zkVMs.","\u201CBut beyond just the improvement in speed, because Jolt is based on a new design paradigm, it is easier for developers to extend, and is also much easier to audit, leading to greater security,\u201D the firm said.","SNARK-based solutions enable blockchains to offload a large portion of computational work. This technology ensures that computations are compressed and verified quickly, without the verifier needing to perform the computations themselves.","Jolt works alongside <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244116\/a16z-crypto-zero-knowledge-proofs-lasso-jolt\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lasso<\/a>, which employs a <a href=\"https:\/\/a16zcrypto.com\/posts\/article\/introducing-lasso-and-jolt\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201Clookup argument,\"<\/a> resulting in a fast prover system for rollups.","Such a mechanism is crucial for enhancing the scalability of blockchain applications, as it facilitates the execution of complex operations off-chain while maintaining on-chain verification. This includes potential use cases in Layer 2 blockchains, cross-chain bridges, and other areas where efficient, verifiable computing is critical.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
