The project's total value of assets deposited <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/280310\/eigenlayers-total-value-locked-surpasses-10-billion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">surpassed $10 billion<\/a> earlier this month.","EigenLayer's protocol allows users to re-stake validators' ether stakes natively or via liquid staking tokens, allocating those funds to economically secure third-party protocols.","The project's ramp-up to the mainnet involves initiating its final testnet on Ethereum's Holesky testnet that will be \"operational soon,\" it said in its post. During a \"stage 2\" testnet on Goerli, 6,000 operators tested the network. Now, because \"Goerli is no longer actively supported by the Ethereum client teams,\" the final EigenLayer testnet is moving to Holesky, Eigen Labs also said.","As the organization ramps up to EigenLayer's mainnet launch, Eigen Labs said that its \"webapp and all contracts on the mainnet will be paused to facilitate a controlled deployment and onboarding of operators onto the network.\" Eigen Labs added, \"This temporary halt in deposits and withdrawals will help ensure a smooth transition.\"","Gradually, operators will be able to register on the mainnet, the organization also said.","Roughly a year ago, Eigen Labs closed a $50 million Series A funding round led by Blockchain Capital with participation from Coinbase Ventures and Polychain Capital, among others.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
