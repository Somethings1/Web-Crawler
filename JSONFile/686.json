The city was one of the first to introduce a regulatory licensing regime for fund managers and exchanges that traded digital assets, with other governments around the world trialling their own approaches to supervising crypto-related activities.","While that earlier licensing effort was voluntary, the new rules will require all firms to apply to the Securities and Futures Commission for regulatory oversight. To date, only two crypto exchanges run by BC Group and Hashnet have been granted virtual asset licenses, alongside a handful of fund management firms.","Licensed exchanges and their wholly owned subsidiaries will need to submit audited accounts and financial information to the SFC, the government statement said. The regulator will also have the power to enter business premises for inspections and investigations.","The SFC will carry out further consultation on the detailed regulatory requirements of the regime, the statement said. The regulator is separately holdings consultations on allowing crypto exchange-traded funds to list in Hong Kong, and also on permitting retail investors to trade crypto via locally licensed exchanges. At the moment, only professional investors can trade.","The new rules for VASPs are scheduled to commence on June 1, 2023.","The amendment does not exclusively deal with VASPs. It also establishes a registration regime for precious metals and stones dealers.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated to provide additional information and context.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
