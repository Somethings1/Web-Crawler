Profanity, which it used for the key generation on the compromised wallet address, was exploited last week, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.1inch.io\/a-vulnerability-disclosed-in-profanity-an-ethereum-vanity-address-tool-68ed7455fc8c\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to a post published by 1inch contributors.<\/a>","The hack Wintermute suffered was due to an \u201Cinternal (human) error,\u201D Gaevoy wrote, following its discovery of the Profanity exploit. Even after suffering its financial loss, Gaevoy said Wintermute will not be laying off any employees, changing any strategies, fundraising additional capital or stopping its DeFi operations.","When Wintermute initially set up its DeFi vault, it utilized Profanity, an open-source tool for generating multiple addresses, and an internal tool to generate an address with multiple zeroes in the front.","Gaevoy said their reasoning behind this was for \u201Cgas optimization, not vanity,\u201D where vanity addresses have admin privileges and a prefix \u201C0x0000000.\" This prefix, as security analysts have <a href=\"http:\/\/Gupta and other security analysts have hypothesized that since the admin address is a vanity address, the hacker calculated its private key, took over Wintermute\u2019s vault and transferred funds out to another address in their control.\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hypothesized<\/a> since the announcement of the exploit, could be taken advantage of by hackers when they can calculate the private key.","Wintermute in June began moving away from this type of set up, switching to a more secure key-generation script.","During the expedited process of \u201Cretiring\u201D the old key, Wintermute moved all its ETH from the compromised vanity address wallet. Although they were able to move the ETH prior to the hack, it \u201Cfailed to remove this address\u2019s ability to sign for and do other things,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/www1.icsi.berkeley.edu\/~nweaver\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Berkeley ICSI<\/a> staff researcher Nicholas Weaver <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ncweaver\/status\/1572339879903887361\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted.<\/a>","Gaevoy ended his thread by acknowledging the fact that operating on-chain trading comes with its inherent risks that Wintermute was well aware of, mainly no safeguards such as 2FA protected key generation or the ability to use multisigs due to the nature of high frequency trading (HFT).","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Editor's Note: This story has been updated with the bounty amount Wintermute said it will pay.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
