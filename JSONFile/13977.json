With permissionless validation, anyone can participate in the system without an allowlist,\u201D the firm stated.","Fault proofs serve as security mechanism for Ethereum Layer 2 networks, enabling users to contest transactions that may be fraudulent or incorrect. They are critical in ensuring that off-chain transaction processing remains free from manipulation.","The OP Mainnet currently lacks fault proofs, a cause for concern regarding the network\u2019s security and decentralization. This implies that within the network, users are required to place their trust in block producers to submit accurate Layer 1 state roots. Additionally, the network depends on a security council of members for backups.","Now, the project is also moving toward implementing them, having already used them on its Sepolia testnet.","OP Mainnet and other Optimism ecosystem chains use a scaling solution called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236277\/optimism-changes-name-to-op-mainnet-in-line-with-superchain-vision\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">optimistic rollups<\/a> for operation. This technology aggregates Ethereum transactions on a secondary off-chain layer and allows for cheaper transaction processing to address scalability concerns on Ethereum.","OP Labs, the developer of OP Mainnet, also operates a development software stack known as the OP Stack, which enables developers to launch their own Layer 2 blockchains. Crypto exchange giant Coinbase developed its blockchain, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/283056\/base-dencun-transactions-users-surge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Base<\/a>, using the OP Stack.","Most optimistic rollup blockchains have yet to decentralize their networks with the help of incorporating fault proofs and maintaining decentralized contract upgrades.
