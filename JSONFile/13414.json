They haven't been sold or transferred to a crypto mixing service.","Multichain has not made a statement in regards to the movement of funds. The Fantom Foundation said it was aware of \"a situation unfolding on the Multichain bridge..","\"We are actively evaluating the circumstances and will provide an update as soon as we have more to share,\" it wrote.&nbsp;","Security firm PeckShield <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/peckshield\/status\/1677034774995648516\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">questioned<\/a> whether this was related to cross-chain platform LayerZero adding support for four tokens, matching those that were moved. Yet this doesn't align with the complete list of tokens that were moved.","LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino told The Block the issue was not related to the platform.&nbsp;","\"It's a multichain hack,\" he said in a message. \"It's 100% not related to LayerZero.\"","Pellegrino <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pcaversaccio\/status\/1677038824734457856\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suggested<\/a> that it could be Multichain bridge users withdrawing their assets to bring them to LayerZero. Yet Wintermute Head of Research Igor Igamberdiev said this is likely to be someone who has control over the bridge because funds weren't burned on the Fantom side of it when the transactions took place.","Igamberdiev also noted that it was odd the wallet that received a large chunk of the USDC also made a <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xefeef8e968a0db92781ac7b3b7c821909ef10c88#tokentxns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">transaction<\/a> from the old Binance Smart Chain bridge a few hours earlier.","The Multichain bridge is supported by multi-party computation involving 21 nodes with a combination of them required to sign transactions authorizing the movement of funds.
