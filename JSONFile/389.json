The state also passed an act on climate last year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While there are many ways to make housing green, Tobon pointed out self-sustaining energy sources such as solar panels or geothermal.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThat will essentially decentralize the property\u2019s utilities, like the blockchain and crypto have done to finance,\u201D he said. \u201CThat means that we're empowering individuals to have more control and, while they're still going to be tied to the grid, the grid will be secondary.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The lawmaker is betting on the idea that being net zero or net negative is going to have an inherent value. Properties following these guidelines could be sort of a \u201Cfactory of credits.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere will be a calculation to say \u2018if you cooled or heated your home for so many hours that's equivalent to this,'\u201D he explained. \u201CSo early on it will be a reward, but then it's gonna become a way of life. As more people have it then it's just the norm. One day, my kids won't even know that people were incentivized to do this.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the proposed \u201Cgreen coins\u201D would draw some similarities to green energy incentives commonly provided by governments, Tobon's vision goes beyond that.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CInstead of you getting a check or a direct deposit of like a dollar a week in your bank account, I'm saying let's create this instrument, the coin, to do this. And then the more outlets that we create for the use of it then the value of the coin is gonna start going up.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the concept of this \u201Cgreen coin\u201D system is still at a very early stage, Tobon said possible real-world applications could include paying for public transportation and for charging your electric car with these tokens.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe're just projecting ourselves into the future,\u201D the representative said. \u201CThe bottom line is crypto is here to stay. (...) I'm not excited about trying to figure out what crypto does for my state when it's smooth sailing. That means we missed the boat. I want to get in early and I want to create innovative concepts that again create a sustainable approach.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Many details are yet to be worked out. Tobon said that the bill needs a few tweaks and that it will be amended before it has its first hearing. The representative expects to get the bill to the finish line before the end of the current legislative session in mid-June.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
