The decrease led to a minimum price of $2.37 in December 2022. The price has increased since.&nbsp;","More importantly, the FIL token managed to reclaim the $5.55 support area. This was a crucial development since it rendered the previous breakdown as illegitimate. Moreover, the $5.55 area is expected to provide support again.","However, despite this reclaim, the FIL coin price failed to break out from the resistance line (red icon). The trend cannot be considered bullish until it does.&nbsp;","If FIL breaks out, it could increase to the next resistance at an average price of $25. However, if a breakdown from the $5.55 area occurs, a drop toward $2 could follow.&nbsp;","The weekly <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/rsi-indicator\/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"glossary-only-link\">RSI<\/a> has generated bullish divergence (green line), and is above 50. Therefore, it supports the possibility of a breakout.","While the <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/technical-analysis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">technical analysis<\/a> from the weekly time frame gives an undetermined trend, the daily chart suggests that the FIL <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/price\/filecoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">price <\/a>will soon begin a relief rally. This is because the price has completed a <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/crypto-trading-strategy-based-on-elliott-wave-theory\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">five-wave<\/a> upward movement on Feb. 17 and has been retracing since, without experiencing a bounce. ","So, it is likely that it is nearing the bottom of the corrective wave A. Afterward, a relief rally as part of wave B will occur, followed by another drop toward the 0.618 <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/how-to-read-crypto-charts\/#fibonacci\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fib<\/a> retracement <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/how-to-read-crypto-charts\/#support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">support<\/a> level at $5.17. Even though only a decrease below the wave one low at $2.41 would completely invalidate this count, a fall below the sub-wave four low (red line) at $4.61 would put it at serious risk.","Get guaranteed bonus up to $200 on Coinbase in 3 easy steps\n\n\t  ","To conclude, the most likely Filecoin price prediction for March is a significant relief rally toward $9 followed by another drop to $5.17. A close below $4.61 would put this bullish Filecoin price forecast at risk and could be the catalyst for a sharp fall.","<strong>For BeInCrypto\u2019s latest crypto market analysis,<a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/why-crypto-market-down-today\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;click here.<\/a><\/strong>","Disclaimer","In line with the <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/trust-project\/\">Trust Project<\/a> guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.
