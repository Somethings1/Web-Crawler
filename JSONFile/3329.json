The SEC served founder Do Kwon with a subpoena as he prepared to go onstage to speak at Messari\u2019s MainNet event in Manhattan back in November.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the attempted appeal, Kwon\u2019s lawyers argued that the SEC does not have jurisdiction over Kwon and Terraform Labs, both based in South Korea (though Terraform is registered in Singapore). Kwon had promulgated the claim that the SEC had no jurisdiction back in December. His attorneys also objected to the procedure of serving Kwon directly rather than his lawyers.<\/span>","In its response to the decision, the SEC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/litigation\/litreleases\/2022\/lr25415.htm?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> that the court had found Terraform's \"'purposeful and extensive U.S. contacts' such as promoting to US investors, employing US-based personnel, and contracting with US-based entities\" as the basis for the determination that a base in South Korea does not insulate the firm from US accountability.&nbsp;","\"I find that there is specific personal jurisdiction with respect to both Kwon and Terraform Labs because they purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of doing business in the United States,\" wrote the judge in the initial district court decision. \"There are employees in the United States, including the general counsel, which I think is telling.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The case has major ramifications, both for Mirror Protocol, which allowed users to trade tokens whose prices mirrored US stocks, and for the broader network of connected projects.

LFG is a non-profit registered in Singapore. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Singapore hosts a fairly opaque system of corporate registration and court record access. But given all the public scrutiny, it is certainly possible to establish a meaningful relationship between Terraform Labs and LFG. <\/span>\u201CThey may be separate entities but they\u2019re companies that are potentially run by the same people and using the same sort of infrastructure,\u201D said Shargel.&nbsp;&nbsp;","In the event of a broader legal case, Terraform Labs or any related entity would also likely end up facing the threat of jurisdictional discovery, a process that would put to the public record information potentially establishing links between companies. Findings can then end up streamlining civil cases, including potential class actions, that would similarly have been on the hunt to establish jurisdiction.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC had not responded to a request for comment as of publication time.
