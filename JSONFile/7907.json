(As always, Rosario summaries are \u201CNMR\u201D and Palley summaries are \u201CSDP\u201D, and for this week our guest summary is labeled \u201CACH.\u201D)","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: These summaries are provided for educational purposes only by Nelson Rosario [twitter: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NelsonMRosario\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@nelsonmrosario<\/a>] and Stephen Palley [twitter: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>].

Pa. 5:18-cv-3904, 12\/20\/2018) [SDP]<\/strong><\/em>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/396406135\/Symphony-Opinion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Link to opinion<\/a>","This case involves a dispute over the use of escrowed funds to purchase bitcoin. It also shows the peril of sending money for bitcoin to an escrow agent who doesn\u2019t actually hold the crypto.","Here\u2019s the gist: Plaintiff (\u201CSymphony\u201D) says that it wired $4 million to defendant to buy bitcoin and instead bought bitcoin for itself. Defendant (\u201CThompson\u201D) says the money was stolen by the seller\u2019s escrow agent. Plaintiff filed a lawsuit and sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction seeking an asset freeze. The Court said no.","The Plaintiff is an Irish company that, among other things, engages in cryptocurrency trading. Thompson owns a company called Volantis Escrow (\u201CVolantis\u201D) that allegedly \u201Cfocuses on bitcoin escrow services.\u201D","In July 2018, Symphony and Volantis signed an Escrow Services Agreement (\u201CESA\u201D) by which \u201CVolantis would hold and exchange assets for Symphony, including converting fiat currency into cryptocurrency.\u201D The idea was that Volantis would purchase north of 5,000 bitcoin for Symphony, in tranches. The ESA also says that transactions would be on a \u201Cbilateral basis\u201D, which Symphony\u2019s CEO understood this to mean that Symphony would only purchase bitcoin directly from Volantis, not an original seller.","For an initial transaction, Symphony sent 3,303,500 Euros to Volantis Escrow for the purchase of 500 \u201Cminer bitcoins.\u201D Instead of acting as an escrow agent for both buyer and seller, Thompson used a double-escrow structure, involving two escrow agents: \u201Cone accepts the purchase money from the buyer and the other accepts the bitcoin from the seller. Once the parties establish control over the assets and verify that they have been transferred, the escrow agents distribute the assets.\u201D","Thompson claims that after converting the Euros to dollars he sent them to the seller\u2019s \u201Cescrow agent\u201D, which then \u201Cabsconded with the funds, with the assistance of others.\u201D Symphony says it assumed that Thompson had \u201Coperational control\u201D over the 500 bitcoin before it sent the money and would never have entered the ESA or sent the money if it had thought otherwise.","Plaintiff filed an arbitration claim against Volantis but when it could not find LLC registration for Volantis on file with the Delaware Secretary of State, it sued Thompson. Thompson explained that the lack of a separate LLC filing is a result of Volantis being something called a series LLC, which doesn\u2019t require separate filings for each LLC. The Court said that this is a fact question precluding relief on plaintiff\u2019s claim for injunctive relief.","This is a really LONG opinion that goes pretty deep into the weeds on the legal theories Plaintiff pleaded and the bottom line is that the Court wasn\u2019t convinced that Plaintiff satisfied the standard for getting injunctive relief. Also, the request for an asset freeze was denied. Though it doesn\u2019t seem to stop people from asking, those are really, really hard to get if you\u2019re a private plaintiff.","What\u2019s the takeaway from this case? I\u2019d say that there are two big ones. First, just because you can file a lawsuit that makes things sound bad doesn\u2019t mean that a court after briefing and careful analysis is going to go along with your theory. Second, bitcoin escrow agreements are fraught with peril. I would personally be exceedingly reluctant to send money to anyone I hadn\u2019t fully vetted and who hadn\u2019t proved to me that they controlled the bitcoin that they were promising to send. The more escrow agents you have involved, the more chance there is for someone to run off with your cheddar. And it\u2019s not like you can run to the bitcoin help desk to force \u2019em to send the crypto.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
