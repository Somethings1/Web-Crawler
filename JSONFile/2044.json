Prior to his time at Circle, YinFeng was VP of Product at LedgerX. He's been based out of New York since 2011.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The company said the two roles have been filled, though declined to release the names of the new employees.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While Salame and YinFeng left the exchange, it\u2019s also been getting leaner of its own accord. Circle laid off 30 of its employees in its finance and products department this May, accounting for 10% of its total staff. Co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said the move was in response to the challenging regulatory climate in the U.S.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Poloniex, an exchange Circle acquired in 2018, has also cut back its tokens in response to the climate.

Still, Poloniex has seen its market share collapse to 1.1%, according to data gathered by The Block.<\/span>","As bitcoin soared towards $20,000 at the end of 2017, Circle's OTC business was known for being one of the biggest money-makers in the market for digital currencies.","A spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry about Circle's OTC volumes prior to publication.&nbsp;&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Frank Chaparro contributed to this report.<\/em>"],"hashtag":[]}
