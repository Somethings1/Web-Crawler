Yet as the games struggled to maintain momentum, interest in trading them has decreased. Kaiko Research data reveals decreased activity in key tokens, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238793\/axie-infinity-cant-seem-to-buy-a-break-launching-on-apples-app-store-fails-to-fuel-rebound\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Axie Infinity<\/a> (AXS), Enjin (ENJ), Gala Games (GALA), and The Sandbox (SAND).","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kaiko exchange P2E top token trade volume<\/span>","\"P2E volumes in July remained lackluster at $1.9 billion which is a 94% drop relative to January 2022.

Layer 2's like polygon are ignoring the bear market cycle and onboarding a lot of P2E games and positioning them for the next bull run,\" he told The Block.","Last year saw healthier prospects for web3 gaming.

However, tokens associated with web3 gaming have fallen month on month since early February of this year. The incremental fall in the value of the tokens have meant the incentive to play games is slowly evaporating.","This downtrend has continued.
