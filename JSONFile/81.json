These so-called boiler rooms would carve out a large position in one of said stocks and then encourage their clients to buy it, promising a big up move. There was often some story about a breakthrough technology or big upcoming business deal to explain why \u201CNot Worth a Penny, Inc.\u201D was about to soar. Information about these companies was always scarce.

Most volume comes from the unfortunates who bought the ICO and are desperately looking for someone \u2014 <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">anyone \u2014 <\/em>to buy the coin and return some of their capital.<\/span>","These suckers have found an ally of the worst kind: pump-and-dump groups that have figured out how to profit in a way that would make Belfort and his Stratton team envious.","The scam is simple. First, recruit a willing bunch of buyers. Typically, these folks will&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pay you<\/em>&nbsp;for access to information because you are promising them quick profits. Second, pick an altcoin that\u2019s reasonably easy to trade. So far, this seems almost reasonable, right? \u201CWe\u2019ll all buy this together and inflate the price! Everybody wins.\u201D","But if you\u2019re running one of those \u201Cpump groups\u201D the next step is nefarious. Acquire a bunch of the altcoin yourself before revealing to the group what the upcoming buy will be. Because of light trading volumes, the very action of getting your buyer collective into the coin is&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">what will cause the price to rise!<\/em>&nbsp;So for the pump-group operators, it\u2019s necessary to front run as much as possible. While this is completely illegal in the stock market (ask Belfort, who pled guilty, went to prison, and was ordered to pay millions in restitution), so far the SEC has done little to police the same scheme with respect to crypto.","Of course, once you\u2019ve successfully front run the trade of the anointed coin, your real profit comes next. As your group starts buying at the announced time, the pump group insiders start selling into the big upward price move. This insidiously accomplishes two goals at once (1) the selling creates the appearance of liquidity in the coin, allowing buyers to find larger amounts available for purchase than normal (2) the sellers are quite literally profiting at the hands of the very people they are purporting to help. They\u2019ve taken your money for the information on&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">which coin<\/em>&nbsp;to pump; and they\u2019re taking it again right now selling you that coin at a profit they\u2019ve almost entirely manufactured by recruiting you as a buyer.","<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Let a thousand flowers bloom<\/strong>","The&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/graphics\/cryptocurrency-schemes-generate-big-coin\/?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/graphics\/cryptocurrency-schemes-generate-big-coin\/?mod=article_inline\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wall Street Journal<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;took a look at data just from the first half of 2018 and found an astounding 175 pump-and-dump schemes in crypto involving $825 million in trading volume. (It\u2019s safe to assume hundreds of smaller schemes abound, albeit at levels that failed to catch WSJ\u2019s screen.)","Each involves one or more \u201Cpump groups\u201D that manage the scheme, much like Stratton Oakmont back in the days before the consumer internet. But the seeming transparency of what\u2019s going on is new, if not especially refreshing. The biggest group found by the&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jounal<\/em>&nbsp;is called Big Pump Signal, with 74,000 followers on the Telegram app. Big Pump Signal is the 800-pound gorilla of this nascent trend.","Big Pump Signal was responsible for 26 pumps this year, but an astounding $222 million worth of trading volume. The&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Journal&nbsp;<\/em>looked at just one of these pumps, involving cloakcoin, which ostensibly is useful for untraceable transactions.

By contrast the volume of 33rd-ranked ICON in the past day was greater than the total capitalization of Cloakcoin.","<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On your marks, get set, pump<\/strong>","With the help of&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance&nbsp;<\/em>data, the&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Journal&nbsp;<\/em>was able to recreate the trades in Cloakcoin on the day of the pump.","Announced at 3PM eastern \u2014 \u201C@everyone be sure to ride the waves!\u201D Big Pump\u2019s leader wrote on Telegram \u2014 it took mere seconds for the price to rise 30%.","In less than 2 minutes, Cloakcoin was trading 50% higher than it had been at 2:59PM.","That led to enough selling to push the price down by nearly 20% over the next 2 minutes.","6,700 trades representing $1.7M had been executed versus essentially zero in the hour preceding the pump","Difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to say how much was made on this pump, but Cloakcoin now trades for $2.52, lower than where it was when the pump scheme commenced last month. Still it\u2019s safe to say some made thousands on the way up, almost certainly including the insiders at Big Pump Signal. Many of the rest surely bought near the peak and realized in panic they had to sell once the price started to fall. Still others are likely holding Cloakcoin even today, hoping to sell it for what they paid. Likely a vain hope indeed.","<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Not just one bad actor<\/strong>","As \u201Csuccessful\u201D as Big Pump Signal is in running pump schemes, they are most certainly not alone. PumpMyCoin, for example, describes itself as almost a democracy. They will let members vote on which coins to consider for \u201Cpumping.\u201D And the group offers what almost amounts to a service guarantee:","Unlike the other pump and dump scam\/groups. We will keep monitoring the market, in order to maintain its uptrend to make sure that our community members are satisfied with their&nbsp;gains.","How they achieve this is unclear, but part of the mechanism is that members have to pay in bitcoin to vote for the coin du jour (0.002 BTC,&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">minimum<\/em>, they say buys you the franchise, or very approximately $15 today). They promise to use the proceeds from this poll tax \u201Cin the price trending scheme to make sure that most of our community members make a profit, and also to avoid the pump and dump schemes by traders from outside of our community.\u201D","Well thank goodness for that! There appears to be no money-back guarantee nor any promise how long the price will be maintained to allow for this profit. Nor really any information on who these folks are, which makes sense given the SEC might decide one day to haul off all these pumpers and prosecute them.","<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Inside the boiler room<\/strong>","Back in January,&nbsp;<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/3074\/inside-the-group-chats-where-people-pump-and-dump-cryptocurrency?zd=2&amp;zi=cvcftrqe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/3074\/inside-the-group-chats-where-people-pump-and-dump-cryptocurrency?zd=2&amp;zi=cvcftrqe\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Outline<\/em>&nbsp;took a look inside this shady world<\/a>.

These groups blend the worse of multi-level marketing, aka pyramid schemes, along with appealing to our most foolish instincts.","Fail to time your sell on a recent pump right? Just blame&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">yourself<\/em>&nbsp;for bad timing and try again. After all, you have money to win back! Wait, win? This is investing, right? Nope, more like gambling where the house edge is exceptionally large. These pumps are typically run on just one crypto exchange, often Binance, to allow for a robust market to be made and the lack of cross-exchange price discovery to be a non factor.","And the newcomer is almost certainly far down the food chain. The heart of the scam comes long before the pump is announced to the world, when the fees are collected and the coins accumulated by insiders.","<iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/l2Je0SXEORW59KzwQ\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","It\u2019s possible to win here, much like you can find the queen in a few rounds of Three Card Monte but in the end the only players here are the suckers.
