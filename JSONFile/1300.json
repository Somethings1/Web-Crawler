The email says that Binance will no longer support USD deposits and withdrawals via Silvergate Bank over SWIFT from June 11.","\"USD deposits made to our Silvergate Bank account after 11 June 2021 (UTC 23:59) will be returned to your account within 21 working days,\" the email reads. \"The returned amount may be lower due to external bank fees involved.\"","\"Rest assured, we are working hard to provide an alternative USD solution,\" reads the email.","Binance declined to comment to The Block on Silvergate-related questions when reached.","Renzo Morales Díaz, a Binance customer from Columbia, who received the Spanish copy of the email, told The Block that his funds have been stuck for \"two weeks.\"","\"I just have a pending withdrawal in USD through Silvergate, and it is delayed. But surely it will not arrive there. We do not know how Binance will now return that withdrawal,\" said Díaz.","Silvergate-related issues for Binance users appear to have existed for at least a few months.
