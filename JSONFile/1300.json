Dune's current team size is eight, and it is looking to increase it to around 25 by hiring mostly engineers, said Haga.","As for launching a new data platform, Haga said Dune needs to streamline its \"tremendous\" amount of available data in one place so that it is easy for users to analyze it. \"We're investing heavily in a new data platform to make this a reality,\" he said.","Dune currently supports extracting data from four blockchain networks: Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and xDAI. Looking ahead, it is planning to support all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains and other networks, said Haga, without disclosing specific names.","The Dune platform is accessible to the public for free, meaning users can create data charts of metrics they want to track. As for its business model, Dune also has a paid, subscription-based product, starting at $390 per month per user. Haga said \"practically all top names\" in the crypto space are Dune's clients. Paid users get a more customized experience, such as private queries and data exports.","Crypto firms, including data startups, continue to receive investments from venture firms amid crypto's growth this year.
