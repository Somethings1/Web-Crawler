This has caused fears about its level of centralization, concerns that led to a month-long <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/152516\/why-ethereums-dominant-liquid-staking-protocol-is-debating-whether-to-reduce-its-influence\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">debate in the Lido community forum<\/a>.","The vote, which began on June 24, still has about a day to go but the outcome seems set. Data from the <a href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/lido-snapshot.eth\/proposal\/0x10abedcc563b66b1adee60825e78c387105110fa4a1e7354ab57bc9cc1e675c2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">voting page<\/a> shows over 99.8% of voters have chosen that Lido should not self-limit. If the vote fails, Lido will pursue other avenues of minimizing the risks posed by its staking dominance.","The platform is currently considering a <a href=\"https:\/\/research.lido.fi\/t\/ldo-steth-dual-governance\/2382\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal<\/a> to introduce a dual governance structure for Lido. This dual governance architecture will involve including staked ETH (stETH) holders in the decision-making process for the DAO.","Staked ETH is the liquid staking derivative token given by Lido in exchange for ether staked by users on the platform. stETH is a tradable token and as such can be deployed on other DeFi protocols like Aave and MakerDAO.","Lido\u2019s current governance is controlled by Lido DAO (LDO) token holders. Only LDO owners propose and vote on governance actions. The dual governance proposal, if passed, will grant veto powers to stETH holders over voting decisions made by LDO owners.","The proposal also includes a time-lock component that will freeze the implementation of a vote to allow for review and possible veto action by stETH holders.","Â© 2023 The Block.
