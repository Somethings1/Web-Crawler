His return of his allocated tokens is expected to realign token distribution with Evmos\u2019 current team and contributors.","The return, including both vested and unvested tokens, amounts to 59.4 million ($7.6 million) in total. Near 32 million of these tokens belonged to Khosla and the rest unallocated team tokens.","According to Khosla, his decision to return the tokens ensures the best interests of the project and the community. \u201CThis is the best outcome for the project and community, ensuring that EVMOS tokens are in the hands of those actively contributing to the project\u2019s growth and development,\u201D he said.","The foundation told The Block there was an agreement with Khosla for an undisclosed amount for the return.","Khosla left Evmos last year due to operational disagreements. The project\u2019s development is led by the director of the Evmos Foundation, Federico Kunze Küllmer.","Evmos is a Cosmos-backed blockchain compatible with Ethereum apps. In November 2022, the team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/182223\/evmos-developers-raise-27-million-in-a-token-sale-led-by-polychain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $27 million<\/a> in a token round led by Polychain Capital.","This return comes as the Evmos community works to improve the project\u2019s tokenomics \u2014 particularly the high inflation that contributed to the token\u2019s price decline since its 2022 launch. The move gains additional significance in light of Khosla\u2019s return of 59 million tokens.","Since its inception in 2022, the Evmos token has seen a substantial drop in value. It experienced a 98% decline, plummeting from its initial trading price of $6.8 in April 2022 to a current price of around $0.13, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/257160\/evmos-evmos-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block\u2019s price page<\/a>. This decline was further exacerbated by allegations of Khosla\u2019s attempt to dump the tokens on the market, which coincided with a nearly 50% drop in its price last May.","Evmos recently took decisive steps to stabilize the token\u2019s value. A notable move is the community\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EvmosOrg\/status\/1744342532803158338\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">approval<\/a> of a proposal to burn 136 million tokens from the \u2018user incentives balance\u2019 in the upcoming network upgrade.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
