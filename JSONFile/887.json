Carter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/126581\/sandy-carter-unstoppable-domains\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">joined<\/a> Unstoppable from Amazon Web Services (AWS) where she drove partnerships in cloud, machine learning and blockchain.&nbsp;","Carter will continue to drive partnerships for Unstoppable, while also leading business development, communications and legal. Since joining in Dec. 2021, she has helped to drive partnerships to over 750 from 61, the company said in a release.","&nbsp;\u201CShe has a unique ability to lead and inspire that sets an example for the entire Web3 industry,\" said Matt Gould, CEO and co-founder of Unstoppable Domains, in the release. \"As COO and head of business development, Sandy will continue to help us redefine what it means to own your identity in web3.\u201D","Carter will report directly to Gould who founded the startup in 2018. It's since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/159736\/unstoppable-domains-clinches-unicorn-status-in-65-million-series-a-round\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">clinched<\/a> unicorn status after raising $65 million in a Series A fundraising round last year. The startup allows users to secure domains as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for a one-time fee. The domains can then be used in several ways from hosting crypto applications to replacing wallet addresses with an easy-to-read domain.","\u201CBy 2030, American women are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/industries\/financial-services\/our-insights\/women-as-the-next-wave-of-growth-in-us-wealth-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-safelink=\"true\" data-linkindex=\"7\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">expected<\/a> to control much of the $30 trillion in financial assets that baby boomers will hold,\" said Carter in the release. \"Yet in the Web3 space, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/andiekramer\/2023\/01\/24\/the-crypto-world-needs-more-women\/?sh=2c508c842743\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-safelink=\"true\" data-linkindex=\"8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">less than 5%<\/a> of leadership roles are held by women. I\u2019m proud to be part of a web3 company that\u2019s leading the charge in closing this gap \u2014 both through gender parity on our leadership team, and through initiatives like Unstoppable Women of Web3.\"","Lisa DeLuca will also be playing a role in helping to close this gap. DeLuca, who joined the startup at the start of last year, has&nbsp; been promoted to senior director of engineering. Like Carter, DeLuca has an established background in industry, having spent more than 16 years at IBM as a distinguished engineer and product management director.&nbsp;","DeLuca focused on engineering and product management for emerging solutions within IBM's AI Applications division.
