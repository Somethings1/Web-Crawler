At this point, Bitcoin market depth is above its 1-year trailing average, while liquidity in more traditional asset classes has yet to recover,\u201D said the strategists.","\u201CThat cryptocurrencies largely survived the stresses of March point to longevity as an asset class,\u201D they added, \u201Cbut price action points to their continued use more as a vehicle for speculation than medium of exchange or store of value.\u201D","","\u201CThough correlations were modest and mostly mean-reverting around zero for much of the past couple of years, in recent months they have moved sharply higher in some cases (equities) and lower in others (U.S. dollar, gold). [...] That suggests that...cryptocurrencies have traded more in line with risk assets since early March,\u201D said the strategists.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n","","Â© 2023 The Block.
