That deadline specifically relates to applications from Hashdex and Franklin. However, if the SEC wanted to approve all applications at the same time, this window is an opportunity to do so. Once the window passes, although there is another deadline for the Global X ETF on Nov. 21, all current filings can no longer be accepted simultaneously, shifting emphasis to the next deadline on Jan. 10, the analysts said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin spot ETF SEC deadlines.

CME's open interest in bitcoin also reached a new peak last week, surpassing 110,000 BTC and positioning CME as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/262555\/blackrock-filing-nuclear-winter-for-ethereum-doubters\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">world's largest bitcoin derivatives exchange<\/a>,&nbsp;outstripping Binance, they added.","Notably, that institutional optimism was not mirrored by crypto-native traders, Lunde and Helseth said. With funding rates trending above neutral since Nov. 9 as perps traded at consistent premiums to the spot market, the latest bitcoin rally appeared to be driven by heightened caution from the short side, the analysts noted \u2014 something that if growing alongside rising open interest, often foreshadowed long liquidations.","Yesterday, bitcoin positions witnessed the largest liquidation event since August\u2019s plunge to $26,000, with <a href=\"https:\/\/velodata.app\/futures\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$89.5 million<\/a> in long liquidations across OKX, Binance and Bybit, according to Velo Data.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BTC liquidations.
