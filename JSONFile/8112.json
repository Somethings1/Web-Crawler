In May 2023, over 90,000 validators waited more than 40 days to join the network. As it stands, merely a few validators are in the entry and exit queue \u2014 and their initiation process is almost immediate.","Additionally, the exit queues for validators intending to withdraw their staked ETH and cease validation are minimal, standing at just under five. This implies that existing validators are largely content to maintain their stakes amid the changing dynamics of the staking environment. The time required to complete the exit process has also been reduced to roughly 15 minutes.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum validator entry and exit queues fall to new lows | Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.validatorqueue.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ValidatorQueue<\/a><\/span>","The current settings for activation and exit limits for validators \u2014 called churn limit \u2014 were recently changed from 12 to 13 per epoch, which translates to a daily cap of 2,925 validators that can either join or exit the network. According to analyst Tom Wan from 21 Shares, this allows the network to accommodate up to 93,600 new ETH deposits every day without necessitating that new validators wait longer than a day.","Nevertheless, the requirements for becoming an Ethereum validator remain the same. Individuals looking to participate in the network\u2019s consensus process must still stake a minimum of 32 ETH (~$50,000). In return, validators can expect to earn a yield \u2014 albeit a diminished one compared to earlier in the year.","The drop in entry and exit queue length coincides with a significant decrease in the staking yield (also called staking rewards reference rate) for Ethereum validators, which currently stands at approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">3.3%<\/a>, down from nearly 8% in May.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/ethereum\/eth-staking-rewards-reference-rate\/embed\" title=\"ETH Staking Rewards Reference Rate\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
