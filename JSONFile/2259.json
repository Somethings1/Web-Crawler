The SEC told the District Court of the District of Columbia in filings this week that its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233652\/sec-binance-and-us-affiliate-redirected-billions-in-customer-assets-to-zhaos-funds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">investigation into Binance.US was ongoing as early as late 2020<\/a>, months before Gensler became chair of the SEC.","\"The Chair is very well informed about his ethical obligations and is in compliance, including with the rules governing recusal,\" an SEC spokesperson said in an email. \"The agency takes its ethics rules very seriously, and it\u2019s something that is also very important to the Chair personally.\"","Binance claimed that Gensler once offered to serve as an advisor to the exchange prior to his government appointment. He also had lunch with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao in Japan in March 2019 where they discussed BNB, the cryptocurrency associated with the exchange, and the idea of launching a US offshoot of the exchange.","The exchange said that Gensler remained in contact with Zhao, who believed he was an informal advisor to the exchange.","Later, Zhao was interviewed for Gensler\u2019s MIT cryptocurrency course. The exchange added that prior to Gensler\u2019s 2019 appearance in front of the House Financial Services Committee, he sent Zhao an advanced copy of his testimony.","For these reasons, the exchange argued the chairman should recuse himself.","Gensler has previously testified that he does not serve as an advisor to any crypto exchange.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With additional reporting by Colin Wilhelm.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["BINANCE","BNB CHAIN"]}
