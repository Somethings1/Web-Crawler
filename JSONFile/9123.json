To do that, its team is focused on building intent-based infrastructure \u2014 a relatively new technology that proponents hope will bring user experience and efficiency gains to blockchains.","According to today\u2019s announcement, so-called \u201Cintents\u201D describe a desired end state rather than a set of instructions to be executed. What that means for users is that they are exposed to many different on-chain solutions rather than a single pathway provided by whatever app they happen to be interacting with.","In an interview, co-founder and CEO Liesl Eichholz gave the example of swapping tokens on a decentralized exchange. In that scenario, users are typically exposed only to that DEX and whatever smart contract they\u2019re interacting with. \u201CWith an intent-based system, a user can just say this is what I want to do,\u201D Eichholz said. \u201CThe services are specialized in finding the best solution that exists on-chain.\u201D","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The core bits of infrastructure Essential is building currently include an intent standard for <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248349\/ethereum-eth-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ethereum.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">ETH<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -0.69%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span>, a domain-specific language (or DSL) for intent expression and a \u201Cfully intent-centric blockchain protocol,\u201D per the announcement.&nbsp;<\/span>","Since closing the seed round in April, the startup <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.essential.builders\/introducing-erc-7521-generalized-intents\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">designed and proposed an ERC<\/a> (Ethereum request for comment) to bring composability to intent-centric products on Ethereum and other EVM chains while making \u201Csignificant progress\u201D on the DSL, which would form the basis of its planned protocol.","\u201CThe Essential team realizes that the current transaction-based model of interacting with blockchains results in poor UX,\u201D said Balder Bomans, managing partner at Maven 11, in a statement. \u201CThe better alternative is to instead work based off of user-expressed intents, which we believe will pave the way for UX that rivals Web2 UX \u2014 but without the intermediaries and walled gardens that are inherent to Web2.\u201D","Essential did not disclose a valuation for the seed round.","Â© 2023 The Block.
