Then the Terra collapse \u201Csparked contagion\u201D in the markets, and in the aftermath of the collapse, the amount of interest the regulator has seen in digital assets from the banking industry began to cool. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hsu said that an interagency regulatory process to create broader ground rules for banks to interact with cryptocurrencies remains active, but at a slower pace. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe general road map is the same. But now there\u2019s a little more breathing space to get that right,\u201D said Hsu. \u201CIf it can be safe, sound, and fair, it will happen, and we want it to happen. But it\u2019s got to be there, and for those that are in that industry, there are a lot of red flags for what\u2019s going on.\u201D <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hsu added that regulators had to be conscious of the fact that \u201Ccrypto is a very hype-driven thing,\u201D and that they should avoid the appearance that they are endorsing or promoting it while talking about how to regulate it. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After his talk, a banking industry representative pressed Hsu about a Securities and Exchange Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/oca\/staff-accounting-bulletin-121\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">guidance memo<\/a> issued earlier this year pertaining to custody of digital assets and how to account for crypto-related business. The questioner said the guidance discourages most banks from participating in cryptocurrency custody. Hsu declined to comment directly on the work of another regulatory agency but cautioned that custody for cryptocurrencies is more complicated than for other securities. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCustody for crypto is different than custody for other assets,\u201D Hsu asserted, because of the keys that have to be handled for digital wallets, and the decentralized approach of blockchains. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s not that it can\u2019t be solved, It requires a lot of careful thought,\u201D Hsu added.<\/span>"],"hashtag":[]}
