Exchanges Kraken, Gate.io and Crypto.com, meanwhile, hold just over 7% of the supply.&nbsp;","Less than ten holders that aren't contracts or exchanges have balances of more than $1,000. The top holder in that category has less than $10,000 and bought the token after selling three different memecoins, according to Nansen.","PayPal did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Block.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
