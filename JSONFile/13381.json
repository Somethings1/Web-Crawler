The crypto-powered, play-to-earn game \u2014 which stars a cast of 10,000 cartoon chicks in an array of costumes \u2014 was one of the hottest prospects to have been built on the Solana blockchain. Through a sale of its chicks tokens in November 2021, the game\u2019s Hong Kong-based developer Catheon Gaming raised $55 million.

The startup\u2019s headcount shrank rapidly over the summer thanks to a combination of layoffs and executive departures, according to people familiar with the matter. William Wu, Catheon\u2019s CEO, confirmed that the number of full-time employees at the firm fell from 80 people to around 40.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe are now in a bear market and practically all revenue generating avenues have collapsed,\u201D he said in an emailed statement. \u201CGiven the above, Catheon Gaming took prudent and proactive measures in August to right-size the headcount and prepare for a potentially long bear market, similar to what has taken place at many other tech companies both in crypto and elsewhere.\u201D<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Several top executives are among those who have left the company, including Mark Aubrey, who joined the outfit in July from gaming giant Activision Blizzard, where he was a vice president and managing director in the Asia Pacific region.

Catheon was no different. Before the trouble sparked by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem \u2014 an implosion that evaporated some $40 billion in value overnight \u2014 Catheon's treasury held a diversified pool of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, BNB, SOL and various stablecoins, according to Wu. A small amount of those stablecoins were parked in Anchor Protocol, the lending and borrowing platform built on Terra, according to people familiar with the matter. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe downturn in market prices for the cryptocurrency assets has reduced the value of the treasury but the company still has a significant amount of treasury and runway remaining,\u201D Wu said.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Catheon had hoped, earlier this year, to land <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.afr.com\/street-talk\/solchicks-founder-rattles-us100m-tin-for-new-crypto-project-20220712-p5b0zh\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">at least $100 million<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> through an equity-based fundraising effort, for which it had hired the investment bank Lazard.
