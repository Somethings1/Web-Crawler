He also agreed to pay a $50 million fine. The U.S. Department of Justice <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264010\/justice-department-set-to-announce-settlement-with-binance-bloomberg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">settled<\/a> the connected criminal case with Binance, which probed into alleged money laundering, fraud and sanctions violations. The crypto exchange will pay a $4.3 billion fine, marking one of the largest corporate settlements in U.S. history.","The defense argued against the motion on the basis of legal standards and Judge Brian Tsuchida previously finding Zhao wasn\u2019t a flight risk, according to a court <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/11\/zhao.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filing<\/a> yesterday. It also claimed the government had insufficient grounds for appeal.","Arguing against the motion, Zhao\u2019s legal team said a defendant awaiting sentencing must be released if they are not a flight risk or a danger to the community. The defense claimed Zhao met this criteria, highlighting that Judge Tsuchida previously found he wasn\u2019t a flight risk at his bail hearing and reiterating his lack of prior criminal history, the non-violent nature of the crimes and his willingness to plead guilty. Zhao is a recognizable figure in the global spotlight, making evasion of the U.S. justice system impossible, the defense added.","Furthermore, Zhao's defense also argued that since he could be eligible to serve half of any term of imprisonment \u2014 potentially up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264283\/jpmorgan-binance-settlement-positive-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">18 months<\/a>, in a non-jail setting, such as home detention or community confinement \u2014 there was no incentive to flee that would risk additional charges. They also argued that Zhao\u2019s home and his family being in the UAE did not make him a flight risk and preventing him from returning would be punitive. \u201CTo return, however, would be to potentially serve a brief or possibly no prison term and then return to his family with this matter behind him,\u201D they said.","The defense contended that the prosecutors provided no substantial evidence to challenge Judge Tsuchida\u2019s decision to allow Zhao to reside in the UAE pending sentencing, arguing that the government's suggestion that Zhao's wealth and foreign citizenship make him a flight risk is unfounded. The defense also addressed the prosecutors' concerns about the lack of an extradition treaty between the U.S. and the UAE, noting that Zhao voluntarily returned to the U.S. to plead guilty.","Zhao\u2019s legal team reiterated that his bail conditions were substantial, agreeing to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264191\/binance-ex-ceo-cz-released-on-175-million-bond-after-u-s-criminal-charges\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$175 million<\/a> personal recognizance bond. His return is also secured by two guarantors pledging cash amounts of $100,000 and $250,000, and a third guarantor offering real property in the U.S. valued at over $5 million, which they said was further evidence of Zhao\u2019s commitment to arrive in the U.S. two weeks before his sentencing in February.","\u201CFor these reasons, Mr. Zhao respectfully requests that the Court deny the government\u2019s motion and allow him to return to the UAE pending sentencing,\u201D the defense concluded.","In a filing on Wednesday, prosecutors <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264457\/prosecutors-seek-to-keep-cz-in-the-u-s-until-february-sentencing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">had said<\/a> that Zhao, a citizen of the United Arab Emirates and Canada, should not be permitted to return to his home in the UAE before sentencing on Feb. 23 next year, given \u201Cthe substantial risk of flight posed by Zhao.\u201D","\u201CZhao\u2019s significant assets and strong ties to the UAE, as well as the government\u2019s inability to extradite him from the UAE, favor a ruling from this court that he be required to remain in the United States until his sentencing on Feb. 23, 2024,\u201D the prosecutors said in the filing.","Magistrate Judge Brian Tsuchida previously ruled that Zhao would be allowed to return to the UAE on the appearance bond \u2014 unless the court determines it will review the decision before 5 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on Nov. 27. The judge required Zhao to return to the U.S. by Feb. 9, 2024.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
