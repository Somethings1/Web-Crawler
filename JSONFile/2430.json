Despite expensive attempts this week by UST\u2019s backers to maintain the peg, the coin has fluctuated wildly in price and has failed to regain its peg.&nbsp;","As of writing, UST is now trading at around $0.68 on Binance against Tether\u2019s USDT, the most voluminous trading pair for UST. And Luna, Terra\u2019s native asset that is supposed to help UST maintain its peg, is down to around $1.25, from $84 a week ago.&nbsp;","The UST situation is complicated and has unfolded very quickly. Here\u2019s a rundown of how we got to this point \u2014 and why it all matters.","A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is supposed to maintain parity with that of a non-volatile asset, most commonly the United States dollar.","Traditional stablecoins like Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC are said to be backed by cash and other assets. There are also crypto-collateralized stablecoins, most prominently Maker's Dai.","UST, which was created by a startup called Terraform Labs, fits into the somewhat loosely defined category called \u201Calgorithmic\u201D stablecoins. Instead of relying on collateral, these coins are designed to use market incentives to maintain their pegs.","Terra <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/29\/terra\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched in 2018<\/span><\/a>, with backing from Binance Labs, OKEx, Huobi Capital and Dunamu, the firm behind Korea\u2019s Upbit. UST launched in the fall of 2020, and the stablecoin saw massive growth during the bull market of 2021.","Do Kwon, CEO of Terraform Labs, described how UST is supposed to work on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/139871\/how-bitcoin-is-becoming-the-new-decentralized-gold-standard-according-to-terraform-labs-do-kwon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a recent episode of The Scoop<\/a>:&nbsp;","That's supposed to maintain the peg. But beyond that, a non-profit based in Singapore called the Luna Foundation Guard, or LFG, had been raising enormous amounts of funds \u2014 mostly in the form of bitcoin \u2014 to serve as a \u201Cforex reserve\u201D for UST.","In February, The Block reported that LFG <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/134871\/luna-founation-guard-token-sale\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">had raised $1 billion<\/span><\/a> to form a bitcoin reserve for UST.

The plans include absorbing the increased UST supply from holders selling it off, increasing Luna minting by 400% to let more UST holders cash out, and increasing the amount of UST that can be sold for Luna each day.&nbsp;","But the collapse has left a huge amount of uncertainty and distrust in its wake.&nbsp;","It\u2019s far from clear that it will ever regain its peg \u2014 much less the trust it needs to be sustainable.&nbsp;","Besides that, the fallout will have massive implications for the cryptocurrency and DeFi scenes more broadly. To begin with, is Terra\u2019s approach to stablecoins unviable? Other Layer 1s, including Tron and the Near Protocol, plan to pursue similar designs.
