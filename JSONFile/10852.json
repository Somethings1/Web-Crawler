However, no government official announced making bitcoin nationwide, legal tender at the conference like El Salvador's Nayib Bukele did last year.","While Honduras' central bank knocked down rumors about the country making bitcoin legal tender a few weeks ago, a jurisdiction called Próspera on the island of Roatán announced that it recognizes cryptocurrency as a legal currency in its own area.","Próspera, which refers to itself as an \"enhanced Special Economic Zone\" on its website, said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/prospera.hn\/news\/press-releases\/pr%C3%B3spera-announces-bitcoin-bond-authority-in-the-first-crypto-friendly-jurisdiction-that-is-fully-aml-kyc-compliant\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">press announcement<\/a> that \"[b]itcoin and other cryptocurrencies effectively operate as legal tender within its jurisdiction.\" In addition, Próspera says it will invite municipalities, governments and international firms to issue bitcoin bonds from its jurisdiction.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Honduras Próspera Incorporated is the promoter and organizer of the Próspera jurisdiction on the Caribbean Island of Roatán in Honduras,\" Honduras Próspera Inc. president Joel Bomgar told the audience alongside Mow.<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;\"<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin within Próspera operates as legal tender -- that means no capital gains tax on bitcoin, you can transact freely using bitcoin, and you can pay taxes and fees to the jurisdiction in bitcoin,\" he said. \"Y<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ou can also start a bitcoin business in the jurisdiction using the regulatory framework of your choice, and all done in an AML and KYC-compliant manner.\" <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bomgar added that accredited investors can also invest directly in Honduras Próspera Inc. through a security<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> token convertible note offering, live on the Securitize platform.&nbsp;<\/span>","Bomgar is a Republican politician in the U.S., currently serving as a state representative in the Mississippi House of Representatives.","El Salvador was the first country to announce the adoption of bitcoin bonds, but the country has put the first issuance on hold due to international market conditions and other factors. It is unclear when that first bond would launch.&nbsp;","The next show of support for bitcoin adoption was from Miguel Albuquerque, president of an autonomous region of Portugal called Madeira. Madeira comprises a group of islands northwest of Africa, known mainly for being a popular tourist destination.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;\"I believe in the future and I believe in bitcoin,\" Albuquerque said, without specifically saying it would be legal tender there.<\/span>","Albuquerque announced that Madeira bitcoin purchases and sales are not subject to income taxes, and pointed out that it offers a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dixcart.com\/clarification-of-the-madeira-international-business-centre-regime\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> 5% tax rate<\/a> for businesses.
