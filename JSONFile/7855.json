The upgrade aims to address scalability issues within the Ethereum ecosystem by implementing an improvement proposal named <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189829\/ethereum-core-developers-signal-support-for-proto-danksharding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EIP-4844<\/a>.","The launch plan for Dencun was discussed in yesterday\u2019s Ethereum consensus-layer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7ob1JFbcwZo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">meeting<\/a>. Tim Beiko from the Ethereum Foundation, who chaired the meeting, expressed concerns about a potential delay in Dencun's deployment on the mainnet. His concerns stemmed from the fact that the upgrade has not yet been introduced on public testnets such as Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky.","He further pointed out that if the developer team doesn\u2019t introduce Dencun on a public testnet before Devconnect, an Ethereum-centric developer conference slated for November 2023, the mainnet activation of Dencun might not occur this year \u2014 which would be a departure from earlier projections. \u201CIf we don\u2019t launch a [public] testnet before DevConnect, it\u2019s probably unlikely we can go live on the mainnet before the Christmas holidays,\u201D Beiko <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7ob1JFbcwZo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>, suggesting that the Dencun upgrade might only be realized in 2024 if not introduced on public testnet by November.","Dencun's mainnet deployment will depend on various elements, including the readiness of the software code across Ethereum\u2019s execution and consensus layers and the preparedness of multiple client teams \u2014 all of which must be tested on public testnets and can demand significant time.","At present, the upgrade work is still in the \u201Cdevnet phase,\u201D with only three months remaining in the year. During the meeting, core developers mentioned a localized developer network, \u201CDevnet 9,\u201D set to test Dencun. This testing on Devnet 9 is anticipated next week before transitioning to the public testnet phase.","The upgrade will bring changes across Ethereum\u2019s two mainnet layers: the execution layer, which oversees smart contract execution, and the consensus layer, centered on blockchain consensus via staking.","For clarity, the upgrade for the execution layer will be named Cancun, while the consensus layer upgrade will receive the moniker Deneb\u2014 together forming the upgrade's name, Deneb-Cancun (or Dencun).","The most anticipated feature in Ethereum\u2019s Deneb-Cancun upgrade is the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 4844, also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189829\/ethereum-core-developers-signal-support-for-proto-danksharding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proto-danksharding<\/a>. EIP-4844 strives to augment Ethereum\u2019s scalability, surpassing the existing capabilities of Layer 2 solutions.","EIP-4844 is designed to enable temporary storage and retrieval of off-chain data by Ethereum nodes, catering to the data and storage needs of blockchain applications. Once activated, EIP-4844 is expected to reduce transaction costs on Layer 2 rollup solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, compared to their current rates.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
