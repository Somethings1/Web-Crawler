Another person close to Fnality said that a U.S. buy-side firm and a mid-tier investment bank have already quietly invested, but refused to name them due to commercial sensitivity.","\u201CFollowing on from its successful Series A investment round, Fnality is currently raising funding as part of an ongoing Series B investment round. Full details will be provided by Fnality upon the completion of the round,\u201D a spokesperson for Fnality International said. They declined to comment on the value of the raise.&nbsp;","Fnality\u2019s Series A raise three years ago saw a raft of big banks back the company\u2019s vision for a blockchain-based payments system for wholesale markets. Fnality counts 16 major financial institutions as backers: Banco Santander, BNY Mellon, Barclays, CIBC, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, Euroclear, ING, KBC Group, Lloyds Banking Group, Mizuho Financial Group, MUFG Bank, Nasdaq, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, State Street Corporation and UBS.\u202F","In March this year, Belgium-based securities settlement firm Euroclear announced that it had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/finance\/euroclear-joins-bank-backed-blockchain-payment-system-2022-03-21\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bought a small stake<\/a> in Fnality.","Fnality first made headlines as a consortium of banks \u2014 spearheaded by UBS \u2014 focused on how to use blockchain technology and tokenized assets to settle trades. At that time, the initiative was known as Utility Settlement Coin (USC). Its Series A round in June 2019 also marked <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fnality.org\/news-views\/usc-continues-to-evolve\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the formation<\/a> of Fnality as a commercial entity, which was billed as the next phase of the project.","At that time, Fnality\u2019s stated goal was to create a network of wholesale blockchain-based payments systems denominated in five currencies: U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, British pounds and yen. In each case, tokenized currencies would be fully backed by fiat currency held by the relevant central bank in whichever country Fnality set up one of its systems. The issuance and redemption of bonds is one example of a potential use case for Fnality\u2019s payment rails.","In September 2020, Reuters <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-blockchain-banks-idUKKBN2601YM\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that the project had faced delays in its bid for regulatory approval.","The following year, in April, the Bank of England (BoE) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/news\/2021\/april\/boe-publishes-policy-for-omnibus-accounts-in-rtgs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a>&nbsp;it would allow innovators to access central bank money through so-called omnibus accounts, in order to \u201Csupport a greater range of payment systems.\u201D Fnality quickly announced in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fnality.org\/news-views\/fnality-recognises-a-major-market-milestone\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a blog post<\/a> that it had applied for access.","In February this year, Fnality ran <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finextra.com\/newsarticle\/39657\/fnality-completes-testnet-transaction-with-santander-and-natwest\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a proof-of-concept<\/a> for issing a tokenized security on Ethereum, with Fnality handling the payment part of the process. NatWest and Santander were involved as issuer and investor, respectively. Fnality\u2019s CEO Rhomaios Ram, who previously spent over 19 years at Deutsche Bank, said at the time of the test that the firm was on track to finally launch its payment system in October 2022, thanks in part of the rollout of the BoE\u2019s omnibus accounts.","The pace at which the project develops is, at present, largely determined by its ability to secure the green light from regulators. Despite the delays, the person close to Fnality said that the latest £50 million fundraising effort is broadly in line with the funding plan drawn up at the company\u2019s formation. The crucial next step is to get its payments systems up and running.","Fnality is not the only bank-backed company with dreams of rewiring financial markets using blockchain technology. R3, which also began as a bank consortium, has raised more than $100 million from institutional backers to develop its enterprise blockchain Corda. R3 recently announced that DTCC, the clearing and settlement group, built its alternative settlement platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dtcc.com\/news\/2022\/august\/22\/project-ion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Project Ion<\/a> using Corda.
