HBAR has plunged by over 90% since it started trading in September this year.","\u201CThe rate of adoption and demand for [HBAR tokens] to use on the network has not been what we originally expected,\u201D admitted Harmon. He added that the proposal to SAFT holders could help grow the network, and in turn, its price.","In October, Harmon had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hedera.com\/blog\/hederas-token-economics\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> that Hedera would reassess the token\u2019s economic model and potentially change HBAR\u2019s distribution schedule. While the specifics of the proposal are not yet detailed, Harmon, in Monday\u2019s blog post, said the release of additional HBAR tokens would be based on the pace of network adoption.","\u201COn an annual basis, Hedera would calculate the total revenue from the sale of coins received as network transaction fees and from treasury sales. A pool of coins equal to 10% of these sales would be released to the participating SAFT holders,\u201D he said.","The proposal won\u2019t affect SAFT holders who don\u2019t want to participate, per the blog post.&nbsp;","Hedera has provided the following summary of the proposal, which is not the definitive offer yet. The company is expected to come up with further details in early 2020, said Harmon.","","","","","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
