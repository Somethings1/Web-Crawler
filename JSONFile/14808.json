With Enron, the examiner concluded that senior officials at the Houston energy company were in \"a circle of responsibility for Enron's financial demise,\" according to a 2003 Associated Press article. As for the brokerage firm, \"Lehman Brothers used accounting sleight of hand to conceal the bad investments that led to its undoing,\" the New York Times said of a bankruptcy examiner's report in 2010.","Read more: Crypto Lender Celsius On Pace to Run Out of Cash by October","The U.S. Trustee noted that Celsius took out a third-party loan but did not identify who the lender was, what the collateral was or what kind of loan was issued.

Irrespective of such cooperation, however, the divergent interests of the various estates, the extreme financial irregularities that have taken place, and the extensive mistrust of the Debtors\u2019 customers, all make the appointment of an independent and disinterested examiner in the best interests of creditors, equity security holders, and the bankruptcy estates,\" the filing said.","A Twitter account for Celsius' unsecured creditors tweeted that it objects to the request, saying an examiner will \"run up millions in costs when CEL should cut costs.\"","\n","UPDATE (Aug. 18, 2022, 22:35 UTC): Adds additional detail.","UPDATE (Aug. 18, 2022, 23:03 UTC): Adds comment from unsecured Celsius creditors."],"entity":[{"type":"Enron","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2003","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Associated Press","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"New York Times","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2010","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mashinsky Declaration","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States Trustee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alex Mashinsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Aug. 18, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Celsius","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Houston","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Trustee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lehman Brothers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Trustee","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Celsius","Bankruptcy","US"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De"]}
