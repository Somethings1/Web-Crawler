These blobs are designed to be an additive feature, increasing Ethereum\u2019s data availability without impacting the existing infrastructure, resulting in cheaper transactions across Layer 2s. An independent fee market for blobs ensures that costs remain low, even during periods of high network congestion.","The team also noted that the upgrade would help make transactions faster and cheaper, thereby making decentralized applications in areas like on-chain gaming and limit order book exchanges more accessible.
