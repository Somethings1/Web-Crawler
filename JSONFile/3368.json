Similar to Wall Street's fear gauge\u2014the VIX\u2014BitVol measures the 30-day implied volatility of bitcoin, leveraging LedgerX's market data.&nbsp;","This isn't LedgerX first attempt at a bitcoin volatility index. In 2019, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/ledgerx-launches-bitcoin-fear-index-to-track-market-volatility\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> the LedgerX Volatility Index (LXVX). But chief executive officer Zach Dexter said the new product will draw on data from multiple sources.&nbsp;","\"The more data we can add, the more high-quality of an index we can display,\" he said in a phone interview with The Block.","For now, the index will be visible on LedgerX's platform. It is also visible on Refinitiv's Eikon\u2014a rival to the ubiquitous Bloomberg terminals that pepper Wall Street. Dexter said it could serve as a resource for options traders, such as those who might want to buy calls if they see a dip in volatility. Call options are cheaper when volatility decreases.&nbsp;","It could also lure participants to the firm's market, which has lagged behind rivals like Deribit, CME Group, and OKEx.&nbsp;","Looking to the future, Dexter said T3 and LedgerX could \"commercialize\" the index, meaning build a tradable product on top of it. Such a product would be a first in the bitcoin market. LedgerX wouldn't move forward with listing the product on its market until it received all of the necessary regulatory approvals, Dexter stressed.","On Wall Street, traders have poured into the VIX and strategies relating to volatility have soared, as recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/volatility-is-everywhere-the-market-tactic-thats-driving-stocks-haywire-11591977978\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> by The Wall Street Journal. Specifically, more than a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of derivatives bets connected to the VIX have traded since the beginning of the year, according to The Journal.","T3's Simon Ho said that the commercialization of BitVol could lead to the development of additional products tied to bitcoin's volatility and allow traders to execute new types of strategies.&nbsp;","\"It could engender cross-asset trading between [BitVol] and the VIX,\" he said."],"hashtag":[]}
