It is not controlled by a handful of major corporations like Apple, Google, Meta and Amazon, the technology companies that build the software, devices and infrastructure users depend on. &nbsp;","Creating an open metaverse will quite possibly require negotiating a new paradigm with whatever companies are in a position to profit from providing access to this future digital realm. Through the use of blockchain technology, many believe a new, more transparent and decentralized internet can be created where average users are stakeholders and have a say in how the internet is governed.","Some argue that this era of decentralization will likely take time as companies like Meta and Apple \u201Cfavor closed ecosystems\u201D while they chase mainstream adoption of AR and VR, according to Rebecca Barkin, president of Lamina1, a blockchain company dedicated to fostering an open metaverse.
