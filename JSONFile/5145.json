The additional funding target from IP-NFTs will be determined based on Matrix Bio's needs, VitaDAO told The Block via email. VitaDAO's last fractionalization project was 1,700% oversubscribed, it said.","VitaDAO is part of a nascent movement known as decentralized science or DeSci. In contrast to the current system, which relies on centralized bodies for research and funding, DeSci aims to source research investment through crowdfunding initiatives and decentralized ownership.","The funds will be used for preclinical studies testing novel hyaluronic acid-based compounds found in long-living cancer-resistant naked mole rats. The research aims to discover an optimal drug candidate for the treatment of cancer and aging-related diseases, VitaDAO stated.","\u201CI am looking forward to beginning this partnership with VitaDAO,\u201D Gorbunova said in a statement. \u201CThe funding and support from the VitaDAO community will bring Matrix Biosciences one step closer to delivering groundbreaking treatments that will significantly improve outcomes for our vulnerable aging patient population.\u201D","\u201CThanks to the collective drug development experience from VitaDAO\u2019s online community and the collaborative nature and expertise of Dr. Gorbunova and the Matrix Biosciences team, we now have a well-designed development strategy in an area that has traditionally lacked the know-how or an established path,\u201D VitaDAO company builder Dr. Anthony Schwartz added. \u201CWe are pleased with the early data generated thus far and its potential for advancing into clinical trials.\u201D&nbsp;","The venture arm of Pfizer backed VitaDAO in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/206552\/pfizer-ventures-backs-decentralized-science-startup-in-4-1-million-round\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$4.1 million funding round<\/a> in January, following a previously announced <a href=\"https:\/\/longevity.technology\/news\/pfizer-invests-500k-in-vitadao-to-accelerate-longevity-rd\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$500,000 commitment<\/a> in September 2022.
