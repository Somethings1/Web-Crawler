If it\u2019s a normal wallet, or externally owned accounts, the transaction would automatically go through since it\u2019s impossible to tell whether someone\u2019s harmlessly swapping an NFT between their wallets or attempting a trade that bypasses royalties such as through wrapping.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">And if the allowlist detects a transaction request from the smart contract of an NFT marketplace that respects royalties, the transaction will occur.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bored Ape Yacht Club has received a total of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179004\/nft-royalties-have-generated-1-8-billion-with-nike-bayc-coming-out-top-galaxy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$147.6 million<\/a> through NFT royalties so far \u2014 the most of any collection, according to a Galaxy Digital report.
