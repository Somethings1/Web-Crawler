It targets the federal funds rate, with a 0.15% management fee, and is purchasable and redeemable by accepted investors via Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin.","\u201CUSTB is an opportunity to pilot Superstate\u2019s fund tokenization platform, and is the first of many steps to develop regulated investment tokens,\u201D Superstate CEO and co-founder Robert Leshner said.

Peer-to-peer transactions will also be possible in the future, according to the firm.","Investors can self-custody USTB in an on-chain address of their choice, such as a single-signature, multi-signature or multi-party computation wallet. Those who do not want to custody their own assets also have the option to use the U.S.-based qualified custodian and federally chartered crypto bank Anchorage Digital Bank National Association, or BitGo, a qualified custodian and New York state chartered trust.","The fund is similar to Franklin Templeton\u2019s on-chain U.S. Government Money Fund, launched in 2021 to become the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/228445\/franklin-templeton-fund-polygon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">first<\/a> U.S.-registered mutual fund using a public blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership.","Superstate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236966\/superstate-files-plan-to-launch-a-tokenized-municipal-bond\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fund in July 2023, following the announcement of raising $4 million in seed financing a month prior. \u201COur vision is to create an SEC registered investment product that over time, competes with stablecoins to become the reserve asset and settlement choice of crypto,\u201D the firm said at the time.","In November, Superstate closed a <a href=\"https:\/\/superstate.co\/blog\/superstate-announces-series-a-financing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$14 million<\/a> Series A funding round co-led by Distributed Global and CoinFund."],"hashtag":["ETHEREUM","INVESTMENT FIRMS","TOKENIZATION","USDC"]}
