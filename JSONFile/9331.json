In February, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210665\/security-firm-unciphered-hacked-into-popular-hardware-wallet-onekey\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">demonstrated<\/a> a similar hack on a wallet manufactured by Hong Kong-based OneKey.","Hardware wallets, which store private keys offline and are designed to protect crypto assets, are generally considered highly secure. Unciphered said, however, that the hardware security mechanisms of the Trezor T model can be theoretically bypassed if a hacker had a T wallet in possession.","The type of exploit depicted by Unciphered would only be feasible if the attacker had physical access to the hardware wallet.","In the video, the Unciphered team said it developed an \u201Cin-house exploit\u201D that allowed them to extract the wallet\u2019s firmware. Eric Michaud, co-founder of Unciphered, claimed that by leveraging specialized GPU chips, they were eventually able to crack the device\u2019s pin seed phrase.","\u201CWe uploaded the firmware we extracted onto our high-performance computing cracking clusters,\" Michaud explained in the video. \"We have about 10 GPUs, and after some time, we extracted the keys.\u201D","Michaud further claimed that fixing this exploit for Trezor T would require a recall of all their products.","Trezor acknowledged that Unciphered\u2019s demonstration had similarities with the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.trezor.io\/our-response-to-the-read-protection-downgrade-attack-28d23f8949c6\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Read Protection Downgrade (RDP) vulnerability<\/a> discovered by Kraken Security Labs researchers that affected both the Trezor One and Trezor Model T.
