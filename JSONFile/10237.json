VARA is unusual in that it was formed specifically to oversee crypto firms.","From Sept. 2020, Orser spent nearly two years as president of Komainu, the crypto custodian formed as a joint venture between Nomura, CoinShares and Ledger. Before that, he spent some six years in senior roles at Nomura, including stints as head of global markets sales in the Americas and global head of wholesale SRM.","VARA is currently working towards the start of its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) phase, meaning any crypto business that wins a license may not yet offer regulated services in the region. Licensed firms will be able to begin offering regulated products once the MVP phase is operationalized, according to VARA\u2019s website.","Late last year, VARA dished out provisional licenses to Binance, Komainu and Hex Trust. It had also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/160336\/ftx-garners-green-light-to-operate-fully-in-dubai\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">granted<\/a> an MVP license to a subsidiary of FTX, the collapsed crypto exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried. That license was revoked in November.","Orser told The Block that finalized rulebooks for crypto firms will be published on VARA\u2019s website \u201Cwithin weeks.\u201D","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
