First, the New York Department of Financial Services hit the company with a $30 million fine, followed by the company's CEO announcing layoffs for about one-quarter of its staff.","After the layoff announcement, Robinhood released its second-quarter earnings, reporting net revenues were up 6% to $318 million. Still, it's a far cry from Q2 2021, when the firm raked in over $233 million in crypto transaction revenue and $565 million in net revenues.&nbsp;","Crypto transaction revenue saw a slight increase from Q1, from $54 million to $58 million. Despite the uptick, overall transaction revenues were down 7%. Today's figure marks the most the firm has made on crypto since the mania of 2021.&nbsp;","The firm touted its introduction of a number of new coins and wallet offering, saying in a statement that it plans to continue building momentum in crypto.&nbsp;","Like last quarter, the earnings figures came hot off the announcement of layoffs.

At the time, it cited a period of significant growth that led to duplicate roles and needless layers of complexity. Today, the firm made similar moves, announcing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/161052\/robinhood-announces-approximately-23-layoffs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a fresh round of layoffs<\/a>.&nbsp;","\"As part of a broader company reorganization into a General Manager (GM) structure, I just announced that we are reducing our headcount by approximately 23%. While employees from all functions will be impacted, the changes are particularly concentrated in our operations, marketing, and program management functions,\" Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, said in a blog post.&nbsp;","Separately, and before the layoff news, the crypto business hit a speed bump today when the New York Department of Financial Services <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/160891\/robinhoods-crypto-division-slapped-with-30-million-fine\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fined<\/a> Robinhood for allegedly failing to comply with anti-money laundering and cybersecurity regulations. It will now be required to retain an independent consultant to evaluate its crypto business's compliance.&nbsp;","Robinhood will host its second-quarter 2022 earnings call tomorrow at 5 p.m. EDT.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
