They included the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), the Construction Bank of China (CBC), Postal Savings Bank of China, the Industrial Bank, as well as mobile payments app AliPay.<\/span>","The PBoC said the speculative activities around crypto trading has severely disrupted the balance of China's financial system, creating the risk of illegal capital outflow across the border and money laundering. It reiterated its 2017 stance that no financial institutions should provide banking and settlement services for crypto-related transactions.&nbsp;","The PBoC added that the banks should check if any OTC traders are using their services to provide on- and off-ramps for Chinese traders in a peer-to-peer fashion. \"The institutions should immediately cut off their payment and funding channels,\" the central bank said.&nbsp;","The central bank also demanded that the attendees improve their internal monitoring algorithms to better analyze the characteristics of crypto-related transaction.","Shortly after the PBoC's statement, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icbc.com.cn\/icbc\/%e9%87%8d%e8%a6%81%e5%85%ac%e5%91%8a\/%e5%85%b3%e4%ba%8e%e7%a6%81%e6%ad%a2%e4%bd%bf%e7%94%a8%e6%88%91%e8%a1%8c%e6%9c%8d%e5%8a%a1%e5%bc%80%e5%b1%95%e8%99%9a%e6%8b%9f%e8%b4%a7%e5%b8%81%e4%ba%a4%e6%98%93%e7%9a%84%e5%a3%b0%e6%98%8e20210621.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ICBC<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.abchina.com\/cn\/PersonalServices\/SvcBulletin\/202106\/t20210621_2011168.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ABC<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www1.ccb.com\/cn\/v3\/include\/notice\/20210621_1624266880.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CBC<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yicai.com\/brief\/101087999.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AliPay<\/a> all issued a similar notice, stating that if any users were found dealing with crypto transactions, they will terminate the relevant customer accounts and will report the issue to the relevant authorities.","Although various Chinese banks have sent out similar notices before since 2013, the exact wordings in the Monday statement are different in a nuanced way. In all previous notices, Chinese banks said if a customer was found with using their banks to make crypto transactions, the banks would retain the right to close down their accounts \u2013 implying they may not necessarily do so.&nbsp;","Bitcoin's price dropped below $34,000 shortly after the ABC released the now-deleted announcement. Following the PBoC's official statement, bitcoin's price dropped further towards $32,000 but has bounced back to above $33,000 at time of writing.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ever since the PBoC issued a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017 and cut off fiat on-ramp channels for crypto exchanges, a lot of the bigger exchanges have largely switched to crypto-to-crypto-only order books.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As a result, Chinese crypto investors have been relying on OTC merchants to get between fiat and crypto in a peer-to-peer fashion. For instance, User A would send crypto assets to User B after User B wires an equivalent amount of the Chinese yuan through mobile payment apps or bank transfer.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It appears the latest measure would likely target such funding methods to prevent the Chinese yuan from flowing into the crypto markets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The PBoC\u2019s new measure comes after the State Council\u2019s meeting last month that mentioned escalating the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/105708\/china-bitcoin-crackdown-usdt-otc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crackdown on bitcoin<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> trading and mining activities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Following the central government\u2019s high-level comment, provincial and municipal government agencies in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/105973\/china-inner-mongolia-crypto-bitcoin-mining-ban-measures\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Inner Mongolia<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/107707\/xinjiang-bitcoin-miner-shut-crackdown-china\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Xinjiang<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, Qinghai and Sichuan have all issued orders to their local state-owned power grids to cut off electricity supply to bitcoin mining facilities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Earlier this month, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/108977\/chinas-shutdown-bitcoin-miners-xinjiang-sichuan\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">nearly two gigawatts<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> of energy capacity that had been powering up bitcoin miners in Xinjiang was shut down.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sichuan made a similar move last week by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/108916\/sichuan-orders-state-power-grid-to-cut-supply-for-26-bitcoin-mining-farms\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shutting down 26 bitcoin mining farms<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> as an initial target and ordering local power plants to expand their inspections.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin\u2019s total network hash rate has declined by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/109030\/chinese-bitcoin-mining-pools-hash-rate-plunge-sichuan-shutdown\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">more than 30%<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> since the shutdown orders in the two major mining hubs, putting pressure on Chinese miners to either be done with mining or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/107104\/china-bitcoin-miners-state-council-crackdown\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">migrate overseas<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
