While these things aren\u2019t quite an Everyday Thing just yet, the SEC\u2019s enforcement activity in the fraught 2017\/18 ICO space has shown no sign of letting up. This latest consent order reflects that. It also shows the potential benefit of working with the commission to voluntarily resolve failure to register a token that is actually probably really a security, whatever the terms and conditions said.","Before we dig into the Order, it\u2019s worth remembering that an SEC consent order is exactly what it sounds like: the respondent (here, a corporate entity that ran an ICO) has consented to the entry of the Order and to the \u201Cundertakings\u201D (things it has agreed with the SEC that it will do). There was no litigation. A court didn\u2019t rule on whether or not the ICO was a securities offering. The order is not judicial precedent, though (as discussed below) it\u2019s an indication that the SEC might go easier on people who didn\u2019t commit outright fraud, screwed up by not registering, but came to the SEC voluntarily and worked with it to fix their problem. But, again, it\u2019s not precedent and so far there isn\u2019t very much of that.","The order describes the facts as follows\u200A\u2014\u200AGladius developed a network to rent spare bandwidth and and storage space to use to defend against cyberattacks to to enhance content delivery speed:","\u201CThe Gladius Network was to be a decentralized, peer-to-peer node network that offered internet content providers faced with a DDoS attack or increased traffic the ability to access spare bandwidth and storage space belonging to organized \u2018pools\u2019 of individuals and businesses (called \u201Cnodes\u201D). Gladius Network participants were able to purchase the excess bandwidth and storage these pools would provide.\u201D","As part of this, they created GLA tokens to be issued on a blockchain, and the tokens would be used as the sole currency for services on the network. Gladius raised almost $13 million worth of Ether in a fall 2017 ICO.","There was, of course, a whitepaper. And the whitepaper said that the tokens weren\u2019t a security and that purchasers of the tokens were buying it for services:","\u201CThe Terms also stated that GLA Tokens were \u201Cnot being structured or sold as securities or any other form of investment product,\u201D and required purchasers to warrant that ownership of GLA granted access to the Gladius Network, but conferred no equity or other rights (including ownership rights) as to Gladius. Similarly, Gladius required purchasers of GLA in the ICO to warrant that their purchases were made \u201Csolely for the purpose of accessing Services&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [and not for] any investment, speculative or other financial purposes.\u201D","The SEC didn\u2019t buy this, and the Order includes the SEC\u2019s Howey analysis, in which it concludes that the token sale was an unregistered securities offering, in violation of the Securities Act of 1933.","What\u2019s interesting about this Order isn\u2019t really the securities analysis which is by this point\u200A\u2014\u200Aeven for non-lawyers who follow the space\u200A\u2014\u200Apretty cut and dried. People invested money with Gladius so that it could build the network and reasonably expected profits from Gladius\u2019s managerial efforts, \u201Cwhether or not they used the planned...network\u201D and Gladius offered, sold and distributed the tokens without registration or an applicable exemption.","Realizing that they had a problem, though, Gladius \u201Cself-reported to Commission Enforcement staff. From the beginning of its discussions with Commission staff, Gladius expressed an interest in taking prompt remedial steps and complying with the federal securities laws going forward.\u201D Instead of imposing a penalty, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2018\/11\/17\/the-sec-cracks-down-on-two-icos-creates-a-template-for-future-enforcement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as it has in other cases<\/a>, the consent order requires Gladius to register the tokens as a security and give investors the opportunity to get their investment back by filing a claim form.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
