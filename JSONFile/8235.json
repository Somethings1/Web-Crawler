VanEck was one of the first to file an application for a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., with its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278250\/vanecks-spot-bitcoin-etf-volume-skyrockets-over-1000-day-before-lower-fee-comes-into-effect\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HODL<\/a> product launching alongside nine other spot bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11.","The platform was born out of VanEck\u2019s digital assets research effort, designed to improve accessibility and security in the space via its \u201CLock &amp; Key Model,\u201D according to a statement shared with The Block.","SegMint\u2019s model aims to simplify the self-custodial sharing of digital assets. The process is akin to having a secure vault to store digital assets and issue keys to others, granting them shared access and ownership without compromising security, according to the firm.","\u201CWe identified a significant pain point in the digital assets ecosystem \u2014 the challenge of sharing access and ownership in a self-custody world,\u201D SegMint founder Matt Bartlett said. \u201CThe Lock &amp; Key Model addresses this by offering a user-friendly solution that empowers individuals to securely share their assets while retaining control.\u201D","Additional SegMint features include a custom multi-sig wallet solution, NFT minting capabilities and token-gated utility \u2014 initially offered for free, VanEck said.","The idea isn\u2019t new, with one of VanEck\u2019s technology partners, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207581\/delegate-cash-hits-400-million-milestone-as-lesser-known-project-finds-real-adoption\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Delegate<\/a>, previously gaining rapid adoption for delegating certain rights for NFTs and other tokens to other wallets \u2014 reducing the risk of theft.","The platform\u2019s initial focus would be on crypto-native users who own or want access to NFTs and have some familiarity with blockchain concepts. Those among the first to use SegMint, who have completed the ID verification process, will receive also a complimentary \u201CAdventurer NFT\u201D \u2014 able to engage in \u201Cquests\u201D and rewarded with additional benefits, VanEck said.","VanEck argues the model also creates use cases for organizations with a community of users who need an asset-sharing solution, such as NFT holders collaborating on creative projects or businesses sharing digital resources, bridging the gap between digital and real-world assets and ultimately opening up applications like tokenized real estate.","However, access to the platform is not universal, excluding residents or citizens of the United States, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.segmint.io\/terms\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to the platform's terms and conditions. \u201CDepending on the user's country of residence, access to the platform may be limited. We expect interest in Europe and Asia,\u201D Bartlett said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Initially, Bartlett said, VanEck will mainly focus on helping holders of PFPs from top-shelf NFT collections, like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Pudgy Penguins, fractionalize ownership of those digital assets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But he<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> also said VanEck plans to slowly grow the platform\u2019s range of services and help users fractionalize ownership of tokens which back real-world assets, such as real estate. Bartlett said in an interview with The Block that splitting ownership of tokens which back real estate may take a while to bring to market in light of regulatory challenges. \u201CThat will be a grind,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By the end of March though, Bartlett said SegMint users should be able to fractionalize <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ownership of tokens which back luxury items like Rolex watches and fine wine. But he stressed that as SegMint\u2019s services grow it will only allow for the fractionalizing of real-world assets if done through an approved provider.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe want to be thoughtful about the collections we put on the platform,\u201D he added.<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
