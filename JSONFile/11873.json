Led by general partners Li Jin, Jesse Walden and Spencer Noon, Variant closed its first fund in 2020 and most recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/121168\/variant-closes-110-million-fund-after-merger-deal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> a $110 million fund following a merger with Atelier Ventures in 2021.&nbsp;","Variant's portfolio includes a wide-range of companies in the crypto space, including NFT platforms like Magic Eden, decentralized credit platform Goldfinch, and decentralized exchange Uniswap.&nbsp;","The two new funds will have a mandate that's breadth reflects Variant's investing history, with the firm noting in press materials that it will look at four specific buckets of investment opportunities: decentralized finance, blockchain infrastructure, consumer applications in Web3, and projects experimenting with new forms of ownership.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Tokens and NFTs enable net-new user experiences that satisfy diverse motivations and 'jobs-to-be done,' from control to belonging, to financial alignment with the products you use everyday,\" the firm explained. \"Ownership is a design space for new product features and experiences.\"<\/span>","The two new funds launch amidst an unsavory backdrop for the crypto market, which has seen volumes across various platforms decline, users retreat, and prices broadly sink. Yet Variant isn't alone among investors in forging ahead with fresh fundraising.

So the tech is working, and again, I think that means it's only going to be more pervasive.\u201D","As noted by The Block Research, venture funding in the blockchain sector declined roughly 22% in the second quarter of this year, from $12.5 billion the previous quarter to $9.8 billion.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
