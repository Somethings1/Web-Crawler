It attempts to take some elements of the Olympus DAO project \u2014 which rose quickly in price before eventually collapsing \u2014 but with a few changes hoped to make it more sustainable. The core idea is to use the project's own liquidity to support its price, in combination with taxes and incentives.","The project initially launched on May 16 but shortly after the launch, a smart contract bug stopped the protocol from working as expected. Users were told to not interact with version 1 and wait for version 2. Following today's exploit of version 2, the token's price has collapsed from $0.24 to $0, <a href=\"https:\/\/traderjoexyz.com\/arbitrum\/trade?outputCurrency=0xc3813645ad2ea0ac9d4d72d77c3755ac3b819e38\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to decentralized exchange TraderJoe.","On the project's website, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.v2.docs.jimbosprotocol.xyz\/history\/issues-with-jimbo-v1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">notes<\/a> that \"these mechanisms are experimental, the contracts are unaudited, and that any amount of money you put into this protocol can be lost due to unforseen circumstances at any time.\"","On May 25, popular crypto investor DCF God said he had bought some jimbo tokens, before realising it lacked the feature he had bought them for.
