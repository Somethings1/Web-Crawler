Though technological innovations repeatedly disrupt incumbent business models, centralization still tends to reemerge,\u201D Gensler said in remarks prepared for a virtual appearance at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association\u2019s annual meeting in New York City.","\u201CWe\u2019ve even seen centralization in the crypto market, which was founded on the idea of decentralization,\" Gensler warned. \"This field actually has significant concentration among intermediaries in the middle of the market.\u201D","Added the SEC chair: \u201CThus, we must remain vigilant to areas where concentration and potential economic rents have built up, or may do so in the future.\u201D","Gensler suggested in a question and answer session during his virtual appearance that most, if not all, crypto exchanges violate securities law by listing unregistered securities.","\u201CAs it relates to the intermediaries, the so-called crypto exchanges or lending platforms and the like, they\u2019re highly centralized,\" said the SEC chair. \"They tend to have hundreds of tokens. It\u2019s sort of beyond probabilities that there\u2019s some securities tokens on them.\u201D","Gensler asked exchanges to come in and ask the securities regulator if they are unclear as to whether a cryptocurrency or token could be viewed as a security, and said the SEC could work on a case-by-case basis as to whether or not an exemption is needed to be made for a particular project.","Though the SEC chair is part of the super committee of regulators that asked Congress for legislation on stablecoins and other digital asset areas, he cautioned against lawmakers creating a new definition or structure around cryptocurrencies that \u201Cundermines the competitiveness of our equity markets or fixed income markets that are regulated,\u201D by changing definitions around brokers or exchanges to accommodate the new financial asset class.","\u201CIf you\u2019re raising money from the public and you call it crypto, but you\u2019re raising money from the public and they\u2019re anticipating profit, then register and have the full fair and truthful disclosure,\" added Gensler.","Much of the digital asset industry has chafed at Gensler\u2019s stance toward cryptocurrencies during his tenure as leader of the securities regulator, and he and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam have not always appeared to be on the same page. Though the two appear to be in agreement on an expanded role for the CFTC in regulating markets for digital commodities like bitcoin, they may not agree on what cryptocurrencies fall under that definition.","Without addressing crypto in particular, Gensler emphasized the importance of treating market participants alike, to focus \u201Ccompetition on price, service, and other key factors,\u201D rather than market manipulation or \u201Cwhether the game is fair.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updates with additional Gensler comments.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
