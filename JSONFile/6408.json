It is typically expected to be filed within four months. The lender already <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/192418\/celsius-extension-chapter-11-reorganization\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">received<\/a> court approval to extend its exclusivity period to Feb. 15 after filing a motion in November 2022.","\"This extension is critical to allow the debtors to reach the finish line of these Chapter 11 cases swiftly and efficiently, unobstructed by the disruption of competing plans,\" said Celsius's lawyers in the motion filing. \"The debtors are well on their way to a value-maximizing conclusion to these Chapter 11 cases with the imminent filing of the plan.\"","There will be a hearing on the motion on Feb. 15.","Â© 2023 The Block.
