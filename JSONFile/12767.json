But contrary to the plan, MDC staff told Mr. Bankman-Fried that he had to leave the visiting room at around 2:30pm and return to his unit for the count. This deprived him of 4.5 hours of possible work time,\" his lawyers said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sam Bankman-Fried's attorneys have been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247689\/sam-bankman-frieds-lawyers-ask-for-temporary-release-from-jail\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">urging the district court to grant the former FTX CEO's temporary release<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> from jail to review documents ahead of his upcoming trial.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">His attorneys on Tuesday reiterated their request for Bankman-Fried\u2019s temporary release.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another point of the argument centers around the conditions at the 500 Pearl Street cell block. Prosecutors said Banman-Fried has access to an internet-enabled laptop at least two days per week at the cellblock, and the laptop has been \"updated with a new 9-cell battery provided by defense counsel that has approximately 8 hours battery life.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Banman-Fried\u2019s attorneys argued that it is too soon to know whether the procedures in the 500 Pearl Street cell block will work as promised. \"[The] last time he was produced to the cell block, it was effectively wasted time because the internet was unreliable and intermittent at best and the battery life of the laptop he was permitted to use there did not provide enough charge for a full 5 hours of work.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Hence, we are similarly skeptical that the cell block procedures will work as promised,\" the lawyer said.<\/span>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
