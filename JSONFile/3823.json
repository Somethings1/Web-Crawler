They featured a cartoon image of a bitcoin with the message, \u201CIf you\u2019re seeing bitcoin on the Underground, it\u2019s time to buy.\u201D","On May 26, the Advertising Standards Authority, the U.K.'s advertising watchdog, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.asa.org.uk\/rulings\/luno-money-ltd-g21-1101558-luno-pte-ltd.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">published a ruling<\/a> on Luno\u2019s ads. It found that the placement of the ads meant they were untargeted and \u201Clikely to have been seen by consumers who did not have extensive financial knowledge and experience of bitcoin.\u201D","The regulator also stated that bitcoin is a complex investment that is unregulated in the U.K. and prone to high levels of volatility.","\u201CWe concluded that the ad irresponsibly suggested that engaging in bitcoin investment through Luno was straightforward and easy, particularly given that the audience it addressed, the general public, were likely to be inexperienced in their understanding of cryptocurrencies, and was therefore in breach of the Code,\u201D the ASA stated.","In consequence, the watchdog ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form. Further, Luno must ensure that its next set of ads clarify that the value of bitcoin is variable, that neither Luno nor bitcoin is regulated, and that it does not seek to exploit consumers\u2019 lack of experience by oversimplifying the process of investing in cryptocurrency.","\u201CWhile we welcomed Luno\u2019s assurance that their future ads would feature risk warnings to consumers, at the time the ad appeared it had not featured any risk warning making sufficiently clear to consumers that the value of bitcoin could go down as well as up, or that the bitcoin market was unregulated in the U.K. We therefore concluded that the ad was misleading,\u201D said the ASA in its statement.","Luno was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/77244\/digital-currency-group-acquires-luno-crypto-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acquired by Digital Currency Group<\/a> (DCG) in September, 2020, for an undisclosed sum. At the time DCG said it would make a \u201Csignificant financial commitment\u201D to the exchange.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
