Bankman-Fried takes aim at FTX's massive advertising blitz, including sponsorship deals with stadiums and professional sports teams, particularly the Golden State Warriors. The case argues that the ad campaign presented FTX and, particularly, its yield-bearing accounts, or YBAs, as safe investments.","\"Defendants\u2019 claims that YBAs and FTX were viable and safe for investing in crypto <span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">are untrue due to the house of cards nature of FTX\u2019s business and movement of funds, as evidenced <\/span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">by the immense collapse in fall 2022,\" the complaint reads.
