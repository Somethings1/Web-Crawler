However, the bottom line was that Binance would survive.","A Binance spokesperson told Bloomberg the depiction of the event was inaccurate but declined to identify which aspects were wrong. Binance did not respond to a request for comment from The Block.","Two months later, U.S. authorities, including the Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264010\/justice-department-set-to-announce-settlement-with-binance-bloomberg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">settled<\/a> with Binance last week, concluding a criminal investigation into allegations of money laundering and sanctions violations \u2014 marking one of the largest corporate settlements in U.S. history. The settlement involved $4.3 billion in penalties and included criminal charges against Zhao.","The DOJ had been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/193988\/justice-department-weighs-charging-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">investigating<\/a> Binance and its executives since 2018 over concerns about money laundering and sanctions violations, with scrutiny on the firm increasing throughout 2023 from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233154\/sec-files-suit-against-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">additional<\/a> financial regulatory bodies, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233146\/us-sec-sues-binance-ceo-zhao-for-breaking-securities-rules\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lawsuit<\/a> filed in June by the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 though the SEC wasn\u2019t part of the $4.3 billion settlement deal.&nbsp;","Zhao also agreed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/253681\/changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down-as-binance-ceo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">step down<\/a> as CEO as part of a deal with the DOJ. He pleaded guilty to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and will pay a $50 million fine. Zhao also posted a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264191\/binance-ex-ceo-cz-released-on-175-million-bond-after-u-s-criminal-charges\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$175 million<\/a> personal recognizance bond and faces a potential prison sentence of up to 18 months.&nbsp;","His sentencing is scheduled for February 2024, and he will have to stay in the U.S. ahead of the hearing, at least until a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264875\/judge-says-cz-cant-return-to-uae-ahead-of-sentencing-for-now\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">further review<\/a> is conducted. If Zhao fails to show up at the court in February 2024, he will face up to 10 years' imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.","Zhao's absence was not just confined to this event; he also missed Binance\u2019s conference in Istanbul last month, choosing instead to stay near his Dubai residence in the United Arab Emirates. The UAE doesn\u2019t have an extradition agreement with the U.S., but Zhao voluntarily flew to the U.S. to attend last week\u2019s hearing.","Zhao had been preparing to step down since May, according to four people familiar with conversations during Binance\u2019s leadership calls. A possible deal with the DOJ earlier in the year fell through after some officials pushed for him to personally face a stiffer penalty, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, Bloomberg reported.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
