However, answers among those familiar with the technology could have shifted.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think coming off the crest of a big price drop or any big price movement, really, I would guess that these price volatility concerns would probably be a little bit higher now,\u201D <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chacon told The Block. \u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But again, given that the biggest chunk of people just don\u2019t know enough about it or haven't heard much about cryptocurrencies in general or bitcoin specifically, I would guess that a lot of people have been fairly insulated from recent price movements.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The study also found that a person\u2019s level of knowledge about cryptocurrencies \u2014 or at least how much they think they know about them \u2014 is the strongest indicator of whether someone is likely to buy bitcoin in the next year. Forty-one percent of respondents who said they had \"fair to expert\" levels of crypto knowledge also said they were likely to buy bitcoin in the next year, compared with 7.9% of people who do not know about it or have very limited knowledge. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Of the countries surveyed, four stood out as being the most optimistic about bitcoin's future: Nigeria, India, Vietnam and Argentina. These countries also had the highest levels of crypto knowledge reported among survey participants.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The study also looked at other areas, including perceptions of bitcoin based on income level, optimism about bitcoin by country and the gender divide in the crypto industry. For example, while respondents with higher incomes cited investment-related reasons driving their bitcoin purchases, lower-income respondents more often mentioned reasons like using the cryptocurrency as a payment method and sending remittances. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The research also found that women respondents in Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific regions claimed \"to have expert levels of knowledge at higher rates than men\" regarding crypto.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Block partnered with Wakefield Research on the study to survey 9,500 people in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. It focused on 14 countries for the survey, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and South Africa.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Block, formerly known as Square, chose these countries for factors such as being big population centers or economic powerhouses in the region, Chacon told The Block, as well as current events.<\/span>","Block, Inc. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/145363\/block-reports-1-73-billion-in-bitcoin-sales-via-cash-app-during-q1-2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported earlier this month<\/a> that it recorded $1.73 billion in bitcoin sales through its Cash App in the first quarter.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
