Coinbase, E.D.N.Y., 18\u2013934, 1\/24\/19. [SDP]<\/strong><\/em>","You know those \u201Caccept\u201D or \u201Cagree\u201D buttons you click on websites and agree to terms of service that you\u2019ve never actually read? Are they actually enforceable? Ask a lawyer and you will probably get \u201Cit depends.\u201D (Facts and circumstances, the terms at issue, jurisdiction, etc etc yada yada lawyer hedging). We\u2019ve talked about these so-called clickwrap agreements in prior CCM\u2019s, and this case particular case involves the enforceability of an arbitration clause in Coinbase\u2019s click wrap terms of service.","The plaintiff sued Coinbase, alleging that it \u201Cnegligently failed to prevent a scam that allowed a third party to steal more than $200,000 from his account. Coinbase moved to compel arbitration pursuant to a mandatory arbitration clause in its user agreement.\u201D","When Plaintiff signed up on the website he checked a box that included next to it the statement \u201CI certify that I am 18 years of age or older, and I agree to the User Agreement and Privacy Policy.\u201D User Agreement and Privacy Policy were underlined and links that connected to the referenced docs. The User Agreement had an arbitration clause with bold-font words in it.","The Court said that the \u201Cexplicit acceptance here\u201D was a clear signal that use of the site would be subject to the referenced terms and \u201Can even stronger prompt to a reasonably prudent user to click on the link to see what those terms and conditions were before agreeing.\u201D Thus, the plaintiff was on \u201Cinquiry notice\u201D of the terms. Although he didn\u2019t remember clicking the \u201CI certify etc\u201D box, the website layout was clear enough to give him notice that his use was conditioned on acceptance of the User Agreement, with its arbitration clause.","From a design standpoint, the case is instructive because it describes layout that in the Court\u2019s view makes acceptance of the terms as a condition of creating an account easier to understand: \"The account creation screen contains only five fields and two checkboxes.\" As in Meyer [a similar case], the \"entire screen is visible at once,\" id., with a minimalist layout and no distractions. The request to accept the user agreement and privacy policy appears to be in a slightly smaller font than other text on the screen, but it is immediately above the \u201CCreate Account\u201D button and \u201Cprovided simultaneously to enrollment.\u201D Furthermore, account creation required explicit acceptance of the terms by clicking the checkbox.","In short, the case was stayed, and arbitration compelled. (As a closing aside: whether arbitration is better or worse is a matter of opinion. In some cases, plaintiffs who have weaker arguments can actually do better in private arbitration. So this is not necessarily a loss for the plaintiff in the long run. It \u2026 depends : )","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
