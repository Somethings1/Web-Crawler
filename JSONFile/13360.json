The project uses an NFT minting process called <a href=\"https:\/\/jpegmining.live\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JPEG mining<\/a>, which stores image data on-chain as opposed to a typical NFT that only stores metadata on-chain.","\"To prevent miners from uploading arbitrary data, the smart contract verifies the data's correctness by computing its hash. Thanks to progressive JPEG technology, the NFT image is gradually revealed as it is mined,\" the project's website states.","\"In return for their work, miners receive a card featuring an image of Vitalik Buterin at varying quality levels,\" it added.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
