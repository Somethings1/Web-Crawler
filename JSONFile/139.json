Per E.U. procedure the document must be translated into member country languages. Provisions for stablecoins are expected to come into force in January 2024, and the rest of the provisions in June 2024.","&nbsp;\u201CIt is now clear that transactions for trading are not to be counted to reach those thresholds,\u201D said Tommaso Astazi, head of regulatory affairs at the Blockchain for Europe lobbying group. \u201CIt could have been a real problem for the whole trading market for cryptocurrencies in Europe.\u201D","The legislation focuses more on stablecoins and other digital asset trading, but leaves the door open for further rulemaking on decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by the European Banking Authority and other financial regulators. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;","The rulemaking is the result of official \u201Ctrilogue\u201D discussions between the European Parliament, European Commission and European Council, which concluded on June 30. Unusually, parts of the text were intentionally left open for further discussion despite receiving initial tri-institutional approval.","European officials began the rulemaking process in response to the Facebook-supported Libra digital currency initiative, which has since stalled, though other stablecoins have since proliferated."],"hashtag":[]}
