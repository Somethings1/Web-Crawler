It\u2019s also where Reality Labs, a division of the company focusing on the metaverse, is located.","\u201CIn the Meta Store, you\u2019ll be able to get hands-on experience with all our hardware products,\u201D said a statement from the company. \u201CWe want you to interact with everything. We want you to pick stuff up. We want you to feel it.\u201D","The store will include devices like Ray-Ban Stories <a href=\"https:\/\/store.facebook.com\/glasses\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">smart sunglasses<\/a>, and customers will be able to call retail associates using Meta\u2019s Portal device, which allows video calling. There will also be a demo of the virtual reality headset Quest 2.","The goal of the store, according to the company, is to give the public a glimpse of \u201Cthe future as the metaverse comes to life.\u201D","\u201CWe\u2019re not selling the metaverse in our store, but hopefully people will come in and walk out knowing a little bit more about how our products will help connect them to it,\u201D said Martin Gilliard, Head of Meta Store, in a statement.","Tech companies opening their own physical stores isn\u2019t new, as seen with Apple, Google, and Microsoft. But this is a first for Meta, which had previously tried selling VR headsets in physical stores like Best Buy and Oculus products in pop-ups around New York City.","The company has created a lot of hype around the so-called \u2018metaverse\u2019 since rebranding to Meta back in 2021. Despite the hype, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs lost more than $10 billion in 2021.","The plan for a physical store had apparently been in place since 2020, according to one 2021 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/11\/05\/technology\/facebook-stores-meta-metaverse.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a> from the New York Times.","Â© 2023 The Block.
