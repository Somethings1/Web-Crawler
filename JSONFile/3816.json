All of the top four memecoins by market cap on the blockchain have posted impressive gains in the past 24 hours. Dogwifhat has gained 28%, Bonk is up 12%, and Myro and Popcat have increased by 27% and 67%, respectively. \"Meme coins are clearly having a moment on Solana because they are fun and easily accessible,\" Colosseum Co-founder Clay Robbins told The Block.","According to Zeta Markets CEO Tristan Frizza, Solana's rally amidst a broader crypto pullback is not an anomaly but a harbinger of its increasing relevance in the space. \"The blockchain's ascent is not merely speculative\u2014it's rooted in genuine user engagement. Its potential has only been reinforced as we witness its transaction volumes and DeFi applications flourish, Frizza told The Block.","The seven-day moving average of daily active addresses on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/274760\/solana-signups-surge-to-record-highs-while-wen-token-airdrop-nears-close\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Solana blockchain<\/a> has reached a multi-year high, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/solana\/number-of-active-addresses-on-the-solana-network-daily-7dma\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block\u2019s Data Dashboard<\/a>.

The Binance exchange token has posted a more muted 1% increase in the past 24 hours.","QCP Capital analysts have observed a notable trend of capital rotation from bitcoin and ether into large-cap altcoins, highlighting significant overnight increases in SOL and BNB.","\"An interesting observation is the rotation of capital into large cap alts with SOL and BNB significantly higher overnight. BNB in particular has managed to create a virtuous self-reinforcing cycle through its launchpool as BNB stakers sell their hefty airdrops and buy even more BNB to compound returns for the next launchpool release,\" QCP Capital analysts said.","Compared to Sol's gains, the price of bitcoin has experienced a pullback after its early-week rally.","The largest digital asset by market capitalization decreased 3% in the past 24 hours and was changing hands for $70,825 at 1:55 p.m. ET, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's Price Page<\/a>.","Also, the seven-day moving average for bitcoin trading volume across all major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges has dropped from a multi-month high of $27.64 billion at the beginning of this week to $22.94 billion, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/btc-and-eth-total-exchange-volume-7dma\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's Data Dashboard<\/a>.
