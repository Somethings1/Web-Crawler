Delegates with major voting power including Ethereum software company ConsenSys and Compound Finance founder Robert Leshner voted in favor of the proposal. Meanwhile, venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz voted against the proposal, deploying 15 million votes in the process.","This particular vote has created a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/news\/post\/207297\/uniswap-temperature-check-spurs-feverish-backroom-maneuvering-among-crypto-vc-heavyweights\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">significant debate<\/a> about the governance process for cross-chain app deployments.

A bridge provider is a protocol that is used to send crypto tokens across supported networks. They instead advocated for a bridge-agnostic solution. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/news\/post\/208729\/a16z-votes-against-proposal-to-deploy-latest-uniswap-iteration-on-bnb-chain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Andreessen Horowitz<\/a> for its part was in favor of LayerZero being chosen, rather than Wormhole.","These debates have led to the creation of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/news\/post\/208095\/uniswap-foundation-charts-path-forward-amid-cross-chain-bridge-governance-debate\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bridge assessment committee<\/a> for Uniswap. This committee will develop a framework for the governance proposal that will guide future cross-chain deployments.","With the vote finalized, Plasma Labs will be looking to deploy Uniswap v3 on the BNB Chain. This execution could happen after the governance process passes a temporary waiting period.","Plasma Labs, in its proposal, said that Uniswap may target as much as half of PancakeSwap\u2019s market share. PancakeSwap is the leading decentralized exchange on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/news\/post\/208772\/bnb-chain-looking-to-grow-remain-competitive-in-2023-messari\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BNB Chain<\/a>. The platform controls $2.4 billion in total value locked, <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/pancakeswap\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to DeFiLlama.","Uniswap\u2019s proposed deployment on BNB Chain arguably comes with a sense of urgency. This is because Uniswap\u2019s business license for its v3 iteration expires on April 1. The license prevents other platforms from launching copy-cat protocols.","PancakeSwap, during a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PancakeSwap\/status\/1620427176356216835?t=HVTocoek1k_B4AojqwCYog&amp;s=19\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent<\/a> ask-me-anything session, expressed plans to launch a third version of its protocol.
