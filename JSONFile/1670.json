It would see the beacon chain \u2014 a kind of backbone for Eth2 \u2014 go live.","\"This is a huge milestone in 80 years of computer science and proves confidence in the progress Ethereum and blockchain technology has made in the decade to date. I'm looking forward to the next ten years,\" Afri Schoedon, pioneer of Eth2 multi-client testnets, told The Block.","<iframe title=\"ETH in ETH2 Deposit Contract\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/asset-management\/eth-in-eth2-deposit-contract\/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"420\" frameborder=\"0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Once the beacon chain gets activated, the Eth2 transition process will move on to the next stage of its multi-phase approach, to complete the full upgrade. There are four more phases left for Eth2. The estimated timelines say the full upgrade would take at least until 2022. However, in reality, it could take more time, since the development journey won\u2019t be without its challenges, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/85771\/eth2-phase-0-roll-out-long-way-to-go\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as The Block reported in detail last week<\/a>.","\"Longer term, we will need at least 10x the amount staked for robust security,\" said Drake.","The development of Eth2 has been in the works for years. Once fully completed, Ethereum will move from its current proof-of-work model to function as a proof-of-stake network.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
