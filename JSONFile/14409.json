Garland said. CEO Changpeng Zhao also pled guilty to willfully violating the Bank Secrecy Act and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264120\/binance-names-richard-teng-as-new-ceo-as-founder-cz-admits-mistakes\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stepped down<\/a>.&nbsp;","\"From the very beginning, Zhao and other Binance executives engaged in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the U.S. market without implementing the controls required by U.S. law,\" Garland said, adding that the exchange enabled transactions between American users and sanctioned entities.&nbsp;","Specifically, Garland said Binance facilitated $900 million in transactions between U.S. and Iranian users, while also supporting transactions between U.S. users and entities in Syria and in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk. &nbsp;","\"Its platform accommodated criminals across the world who used Binance to move their stolen funds and other criminal proceeds,\" he continued. \"Binance prioritized its profits over the safety of the American people.\"","\"Binance also did more than just fail to comply with federal law \u2013 it pretended to comply,\" he added.","Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman Rostin Behnam said that Zhao will have to pay <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cftc.gov\/PressRoom\/PressReleases\/8825-23\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$150 million<\/a> in penalties to the CTFC. The regulator also announced that former Binance Chief Compliance Officer, Samuel Lim, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cftc.gov\/PressRoom\/PressReleases\/8826-23\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">agreed to a proposed consent<\/a> order for permanent injunction that will see him pay a $1.5 million civil monetary penalty.&nbsp;","\"The message here should be clear: Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor. It makes you a criminal,\" Garland said. \"This Justice Department has no tolerance for crimes that threaten our economic institutions and undermine public trust in the fairness of those institutions. And we will hold accountable the individuals who commit and profit from them.\"","Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/speech\/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-delivers-remarks-announcing-binance-and-ceo-guilty\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> the case should serve as a lesson to the industry that ignoring laws \"is not a path to riches but a path to federal prosecution.\"","\"Rather than implement the basic anti-money laundering safeguards that his team recommended \u2013 safeguards required by U.S. law \u2013 Binance and its founder operated as though the rules didn\u2019t apply,\" she said. \"Crypto assets may be advertised as borderless in nature, but the Department of Justice will enforce U.S. law across and throughout crypto markets, even in their darkest corners.\"","U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that FinCEN, OFAC and the IRS Criminal Investigation division have been investigating Binance for three years. The enforcement actions the U.S. government is taking against crypto exchanges are \"not meant to end cryptocurrency activities but they must comply with the U.S. law,\" Yellen added.","Binance came under scrutiny by the U.S government earlier this year.","In May, the DOJ began <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229711\/doj-binance-russia-sanctions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">investigating<\/a> Binance over whether it allowed Russian users to evade sanctions.
