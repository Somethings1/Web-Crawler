The bearish sentiment is likely tied to the lack of predictability in Coinbase\u2019s revenues, which are volatile and heavily dependent on trading fees.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During the latest episode of The Scoop, Coinbase president Emilie Choi said that Wall Street is focused too much on the predictability of short-term revenue rather than the much broader gameplan the company has for becoming a foundation for the emerging crypto-economy.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe have obviously our flagship brokerage, and then we have the exchange and those are reinventing what a financial system can mean,\u201D she said. \u201CAnd then the final part of this strategy is about crypto as a new form of App Store, and there\u2019s so much to tap into there.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That shift could help diversify its revenue model, she added.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe have largely a trading model that generates a ton of revenue for us, and we love that model and we\u2019re totally OK with the volatility of it. And at the same time, we\u2019re investing very heavily in the subscription and services model, and you\u2019re seeing a lot of growth from that because it\u2019s the thing that helps us control our own destiny.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To that end, Choi said the firm plans to pour more resources into its Coinbase Wallet. It is also expanding its subscription businesses \u2014 like Coinbase Cloud \u2014 as a means to grow its non-transaction-based revenue.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As such, it might not make sense for the exchange to be compared by financial analysts to exchanges like Nasdaq or brokerage firms like Interactive Brokers \u2014 at least not in Choi\u2019s view. That said, it\u2019s not easy for her to pinpoint exactly how investors should think about Coinbase \u2014 a fact that stems from the maturity level of crypto and web3. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Here\u2019s Choi (emphasis is our own):&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis goes back to what we were talking about with Tesla. Yeah. Is it a car company? And was Amazon like a book company? Was Square a purely financial services company?
