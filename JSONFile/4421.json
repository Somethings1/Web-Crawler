Bankman-Fried could argue that Celsius was not defrauded and not entitled to restitution in a future appeal, while Mashinsky could argue the opposite, the prosecutors explained. Both FTX and Celsius have since filed for bankruptcy.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The relationship between Alameda Research and Celsius creates the potential for conflicts in several respects,\" the U.S. prosecutors said in their letter.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bankman-Fried said he had discussed the potential conflict with appellate counsel Alexandra Shapiro who will be a part of his eventual appeal, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/1-sam-bankman-fried-stick-192240810.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reuters<\/span><\/a>.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ira Lee Sorkin, who represented the infamous Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernie Madoff, said <\/span><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">new lawyers often come in after a trial who have appellate experience.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"To the extent that the court and the lawyers want to make sure that any communications that Mr. Bankman-Fried had with the Cohen firm, he's going to waive the attorney-client privilege so that the Cohen firm can communicate with the Mukasey firm with respect to the appeal.
