The price of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.","Altcoins added to the declines on Monday. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/bnb\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BNB<\/a> token slipped to $209 at 7:30 a.m. ET, according to CoinGecko, down over 12% in the past week.

The first is the attraction of U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, now at highs not seen since 2007. Secondly, there is the possibility of a hawkish statement from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234729\/bitcoin-price-swings-as-federal-reserve-opts-to-hold-interest-rates-in-place\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Federal Reserve<\/a> Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday.","One analyst told The Block that ahead of Friday\u2019s speech, \u201Cinvestors might now be transitioning from these riskier assets in favor of bonds.\u201D","\u201CIt remains to be determined whether this shift is temporary or indicative of a longer-term strategic realignment due to macroeconomic uncertainties,\u201D said Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Labs.","Feng added that, given the current inflationary environment, \u201Cmany anticipate a moderately hawkish tone at Jackson Hole, signaling a commitment to addressing these concerns.\u201D However, Feng acknowledged that the Fed is wary of the potential for recession and may avoid explicitly signaling more aggressive rate hikes.","Ravi Doshi, global head of trading at Genesis, told The Block that Powell might use Friday\u2019s announcement as a way to transmit the Fed\u2019s desire to keep rates higher for longer. \u201CBut, ultimately the market is expecting rate cuts in 2024,\u201D he added.","There is the potential for a massive wave of dollar strength after Jackson Hole. A strengthening U.S. dollar index (DXY) can create headwinds for risk assets. If the greenback\u2019s attractiveness as a safe haven increases further, the risk-adjusted return associated with bitcoin becomes less palatable.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
