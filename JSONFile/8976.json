This release will be followed by Rugpull Guys and a platform fighting game. Oh Baby Games plans to launch cross-game collectibles as part of its rollout strategy and launch these games in 2023.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CThe Kart genre hasn\u2019t innovated for decades. Equipment should matter. Custom garages to personalize and show off. Ghost battles against others. Player made bounties. The tracks should tell a story, not just be a continuous 3 lap loop all the time,\u201D said Pas Tran, founder of Oh Baby Games.","Oh Baby Games has been quiet about what it has been working on, but has released teasers of the game leading up to this announcement.

This raise allows us to move even faster,\u201D said Tran.&nbsp;","Oh Baby Games emphasized one of its core focuses as a gaming platform is integrating the lore, community and stories of crypto Twitter. This is showcased in their in-game usage of the profile picture characters from some of their seed investors. Games are a great way to tell stories, and this aspect of its gaming platform will play a role in their user growth strategy, the company said.","&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
