He\u2019s based in the U.S., but insists he has nothing at all to do with Binance US, the exchange\u2019s American unit. His remit covers the rest of the world, outside the U.S.","He agreed to come aboard after CZ, as Zhao is often known, convinced him that Binance has \u201Cturned the corner\u201D on compliance. According to Perlman, those words have also been matched with action. The company has grown its compliance team to about 750 people and added new tools for checking clients' identities as they\u2019re onboarded.","Perlman likens the challenge of regulatory compliance to adjusting a dial to find an \u201Cequilibrium.\u201D","\u201CYou can turn the dial one way or another. I want to protect Binance from bad actors. Easy to do: just turn the dial all the way, then we've got no users. And so how to calibrate that is a challenge.\u201D","To reassure regulators that Binance\u2019s culture has indeed changed, Perlman says it\u2019s important to \u201Covercommunicate\u201D with them and ensure all decisions are clearly documented.","Binance\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, who sat in on the interview, doubled down on the idea that Binance needs to overcommunicate to reassure both regulators and users. He added that the company is also trying to give more information when technical faults halt trading, for example.","\u201CWe've gotten the leadership team in the mindset \u2014 on the tech side too \u2014 that you have to go above and beyond,\u201D Hillmann said. \u201CJust tell them what is the issue, even if it's stupid, if it's embarrassing, it's better to be out there and to explain this to people and make them understand.\u201D","When Binance leaves a \u201Cvacuum of information out there\u201D it can \u201Cfill with speculation,\u201D he added.","Perlman expressed optimism that, while financial regulators are currently on the warpath following <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185083\/ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">November\u2019s collapse of Binance rival FTX<\/a>, their concerns will wane in time.","\u201CRegulators are burned by something that's happened in the industry and so they're going to naturally calibrate tighter. And then it'll subside \u2014 and that's the equilibrium,\u201D Perlman said. \u201CWe're right now in a sort of post-FTX world where I can understand the focus being like, \u2018we don't trust you.\u2019\u201D","Binance has had a wild ride since its inception in 2017, with its share of trading volume peaking at 62% in February \u2014 up from 20% five years earlier.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/the-block-legitimate-index-market-share\/embed\" title=\"Monthly Exchange Volume Market Share\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","While Hillmann is keen to stress the exchange\u2019s breakneck growth from a 30-person startup to its current headcount of more than 8,000, that growth has created some disgruntled employees along the way.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/Overview\/Working-at-Binance-EI_IE1816824.11,18.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance\u2019s rating<\/a> on the company review site Glassdoor sits at 3.2 stars, compared with 3.7 stars for Coinbase and 3.4 stars for Gemini. Kraken, another crypto exchange, boasts 4.4 stars, although its listing comes with a warning that \u201Cthis employer has taken legal action against reviewers.\u201D","Common complaints about Binance on Glassdoor concern its long hours, \u201Ctoxic\u201D culture and a perceived necessity to speak Chinese to get ahead. On the other hand, its high pay is almost universally praised.","Asked about how he\u2019s found Binance\u2019s culture since joining, Perlman\u2019s only comment is that \u201CI've never seen a company so user-focused.\u201D","Hillmann gave an example to illustrate that commitment to users, enthusing that all members of the executive team \u2014 including CZ \u2014 have to spend time every month answering customer support tickets.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/blog\/leadership\/finding-focus-with-the-binance-compliance-team-128502948348993411\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stronger compliance measures<\/a>, of course, create pain for users, although Perlman is excited to make the process as slick as possible as Binance grows. \u201CCan we make what is arguably a friction \u2014 maybe an unpleasant experience because we need [to ask about] your source of wealth \u2014 can we make that better?\u201D","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
