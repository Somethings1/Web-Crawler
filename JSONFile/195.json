Luxor appears to be making the case that these belong on Bitcoin.","Digging into the project a bit more, it seems to be some sort of a collaboration between the mining company and well-known crypto developer Udi Wertheimer. A dedicated Discord server has been set up for the project where Wertheimer outlined the dilemma facing the community.","\"Will you join the Keepers and try to revive the Curse? Or will you join the Taproot Wizards and storm the Gates?\" he said in the server.","Wertheimer added that the project's followers should stay tuned with updates to be posted in the Discord server \u2014 suggesting this may not be a one-off.
