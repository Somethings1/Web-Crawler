Criminal charges were filed against them on Feb. 28.","\u201CWhile it is inappropriate for us to comment on the substance of the claims at this time, we can say that we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to bring Nadeem and Tigran back home safely to their families,\u201D a Binance spokesperson told The Block at the time.&nbsp;","However, one of the executives, Anjarwalla, escaped the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Friday, Nigeria\u2019s Premium Times <a href=\"https:\/\/www.premiumtimesng.com\/news\/top-news\/680511-exclusive-detained-binance-executive-escapes-from-custody-in-nigeria.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a>. Anjarwalla was being held at a guest house with colleague Gambaryan but reportedly escaped after guards had escorted him to a nearby mosque for Friday prayers.","Anjarwalla is a British national who also holds a Kenyan passport and is thought to have fled the country via a Middle East airline. Anjarwalla boarded the international flight despite his British passport being confiscated by the Nigerian authorities. However, an immigration official reportedly said he used his Kenyan passport instead.","\"We were made aware that Nadeem is no longer in Nigerian custody,\" a Binance spokesperson told The Block. \"Our primary focus remains on the safety of our employees and we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to quickly resolve this issue.\"","Nigerian authorities are now investigating how he obtained the passport, as it was not on his person at the time of arrest, and his intended destination to try and bring him back into custody.","Earlier this month, Binance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/280577\/binance-nigeria-naira-support\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cut support<\/a> for the Nigerian naira on its platform amid numerous reports of its conflicts with the Nigerian regulators and requests for information on its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/282164\/nigeria-binance-user-data\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">top 100 users<\/a> in the country.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
