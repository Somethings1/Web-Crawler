Oh, and then send bitcoin to the moon.","Those were among the ideas batted around at the Bitcoin Builders Conference in Miami today, ahead of the Bitcoin 2023 Conference.","\u201CPeople in crypto are not the most hygienic, I don't know why,\u201D Udi Wertheimer, co-founder of Taproot Wizards, said jokingly. \u201CIt's just not always a very good experience to be next to crypto people. So we thought it's time to fix it. If we want to go mainstream and we want people to adopt crypto, we need to be presentable. We were like, ok, let's get people to take showers and we asked people, in order to get into the Taproot Wizard community, we asked them to take a shower, wearing a wizard costume.\u201D","Ordinals and BRC-20 were the talk of the event, with attendees saying new developments can bring some of the fun back that had some people turn to other blockchains over recent years.","Fun is also a good way to go mainstream, enthusiasts agreed. The crypto industry is also eager to find new adopters amid a slide in interest, with cryptocurrency prices nowhere near their 2021 highs and the industry digesting a spectacular parade of corporate collapses.","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's George Calle, Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at Coinshares, Muneeb Ali, CEO Trust Machines<\/em><\/span>","Ordinals recently led costs to spike and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230911\/bitcoin-addresses-volume-transaction-fees\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">concerned some over the cluttering of the blockchain<\/a>.","There were also very serious discussions at the Bitcoin Builders event, where panels included chats about rollups and ZK proofs.","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aubrey Strobel, host of the Aubservation, Udi Wertheimer, co-founder of Taproot Wizards, Joe Vezzani, co-founder &amp; CEO of LunarCrush, Danny Yang, founder, OnChainMonkey, <\/em><\/span>","Earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.taprootwizards.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Taproot Wizards<\/a>, an NFT collection, gave people the opportunity to complete quests to acquire a Taproot Wizard.
