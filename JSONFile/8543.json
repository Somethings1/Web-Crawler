For institutional clients, possibly avoiding a lengthy onboarding process. And for Binance, it could mean access to institutional clients and&nbsp; a top-notch engineering team. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For FTX.com\u2019s existing institutional clients, a buyout by Binance \u2014 including acquisition of the company\u2019s technology and employees \u2014 could be a boon. If FTX were to fold, the institutional clients that eventually moved to Binance would need to go through a potentially drawn-out onboarding process. But rather than allow that to happen, Binance CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao instead pledged support for beleaguered FTX.com. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A buyout of FTX.com, including access company\u2019s technology and employees would provide Binance a means to acquire these institutional clients and avoid prolonged onboarding. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The mixture of technology and access to FTX.com\u2019s engineering team are among factors that Steven Zheng, a researcher at The Block, said support Binance\u2019s motivations to purchase its competition. \u201CThe political points of not letting a massive exchange like FTX fail is also a good add-on. FTX is historically the second- to third- largest exchange by volume. The acquisition of FTX would push Binance\u2019s market share to over 80%,\u201D Zheng said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So, for CZ, although the implosion of FTX.com would see a serious competitor put out of commission, there may also be real benefits to stepping up and buying the company out.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance did not immediately respond to The Block\u2019s request for comment.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, Binance\u2019s letter of intent is not an absolute, and should Binance choose to renege, FTX.com will be forced to plug a nearly $3 billion hole. \u201CIf Binance backs out, I don\u2019t think FTX can do much except paying out only a fraction of what their customers deposited,\u201D said Zheng.<\/span>","On whether or not Binance may go through with the deal, CEO of Coinbase Brian Armstrong is said to have commented that there are a number of reasons why it might not make sense, although he added he was not at liberty to share why. \"It'll probably come out eventually,\" Armstrong is quoted as saying on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sonalibasak\/status\/1590118521757134848?s=20&amp;t=9buBbmGYwned2kAhVwQefQ\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a>, adding that \"it may be a bad situation if this deal doesn't go through for the customers involved.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTT\u2019s falling price previously prompted Armstrong to release a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/184435\/coinbase-says-it-has-no-material-exposure-to-ftx-or-ftt\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> saying Coinbase is not materially exposed to FTX or FTT.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Not included in the proposed acquisition is FTX\u2019s U.S.-facing marketplace, hosted on FTX.us, nor Binance.us, which founder of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sbf_ftx\/status\/1590012133307478016?s=46&amp;t=k3pvw9jQNzSBpJ10RzOfnA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> are both completely separate entities.
