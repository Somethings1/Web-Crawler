While Hashed is actively investing in the emerging Web3 gaming ecosystem, their ambitions don't stop there.","In this episode of The Scoop, Baek Kim, general partner at Hashed, joins host Frank Chaparro to explain how Hashed has taken additional steps to help shape the future of crypto gaming.","As Kim explained during the interview:","\u201CWe realized that there are so many gaps in the industry where we don\u2019t want to be just waiting, as investors, for founders to show up to solve those problems, but we want to do more and be hands-on in a product building manner.\u201D","According to Kim, one of the main problems currently facing crypto gaming is sustainability. Indeed, existing crypto gaming projects are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/gaming\/gaming-nft-trade-volume\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fading<\/a> in popularity, according to data collected by The Block Research.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/gaming\/gaming-nft-trade-volume\/embed\" title=\"Gaming NFT Trade Volume\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","While projects such as Axie Infinity have tried to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/135884\/axie-infinity-maker-poaches-jump-director-as-part-of-bid-to-draw-in-more-game-developers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">poach<\/a> outside talent to reverse shrinking user bases, Hashed has created its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unopnd.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">own<\/a> \"metaverse ventures studio\"&nbsp;with a team of over 80 people in order to help talented game developers incubate more sustainable Web3 games.","According to Kim, the sustainability of a Web3 game comes down to content:","\u201CI think crypto and the Web3 space at the current moment of growth, is a very unique opportunity for our generation. It\u2019s a unique opportunity to create original IP success. When we look at the history of the number one success stories, it is always original content.\u201D","While existing crypto games largely rely on financial incentives instead of sustainable content to retain their users, Kim notes that games like Axie Infinity are \u201Cfun enough to hang out in the Discord channel.\u201D","In fact, Kim suggests that interacting with crypto gaming communities outside of the game can be even more fun than actually \"playing games.\" This is a phenomenon that Kim believes is \u201Cquite unique about crypto gaming.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro and Kim also discuss:<\/em>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fireblocks.com\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/coinbase.com\/prime\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase Prime<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/Chainalysis.com\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.
