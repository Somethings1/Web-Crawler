It also raised previous support from Y Combinator and others.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The startup largely focuses on helping crypto firms and financial institutions comply with the FATF\u2019s \"travel rule,\" which <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fatf-gafi.org\/media\/fatf\/documents\/recommendations\/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">requires<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> so-called virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to \u201Cobtain, hold, and transmit required originator and beneficiary information.\u201D FATF released its finalized crypto guidance on Oct. 28 after issuing a draft in 2019. Compliance with the guidelines will be crucial for exchanges seeking operating licenses.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CReally what it says is that if you\u2019re a crypto exchange, and you are sending funds on behalf of your customer to another crypto exchange, you need to understand who is the ultimate beneficiary of that transaction,\u201D Notabene CEO<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pelleb\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Pelle <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Braendgaard<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> told The Block. These include withdrawals and deposits to exchanges, he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Notabene estimates that more than 80% of the world\u2019s exchanges will have to implement the travel rule by the second quarter of 2022.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s really difficult \u2014 it\u2019s not an easy thing to do,\u201D Braendgaard said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Notabene already counts exchanges like Bitso, Crypto.com, Luno and Paxful among its customers.

VASPs are not just faced with the challenge of appeasing their own regulators \u2014 they also have to figure out how to not lose overseas transaction volumes in the process, Braendgaard explained.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For example, South Korean exchanges will be required to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/notabene.id\/world\/south-korea\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">implement the travel rule by March<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. But now, any exchanges sending large amounts of transaction volumes from South Korea \u2014 whether or not they\u2019re based in the country \u2014 also have to heed those regulations.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSo, we\u2019re seeing a large influx of companies that are moving up their own internal travel rule compliance so they don\u2019t lose transaction volume,\" Braendgaard said.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
