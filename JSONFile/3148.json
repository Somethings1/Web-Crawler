Level 0 \u2014 for withdrawals of up to 1 bitcoin and 50 ether \u2014 requires basic information such as name, email, date of birth, address, and country of residence. Level 1 \u2014 unrestricted withdrawals \u2014 needs basic information plus a passport or government ID.

Meanwhile, the DOJ filed criminal charges against Hayes, Delo, Reed, and BitMEX head of business development Greg Dwyer for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.","Deribit appears to be taking extra caution with its upcoming mandatory verification plan, although the Panama-based exchange does not allow U.S. residents to trade on its platform.","\"Over the years, we have been quite vigilant in blocking account openings by U.S. persons,\" Jansen told The Block. \"We perform IP access checks on a regular basis, and, actually, we continue to do this as we speak.\"","Indeed, earlier today, some users <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/loomdart\/status\/1318691232315592704?s=21\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">highlighted<\/a> that they received a notice from Deribit, saying that they could be located in the U.S., and thus aren't allowed to access the platform. \"These users could be from the U.S., or at least from an IP known to us as a U.S. IP,\" said Jansen.","\"Our experience is that the vast majority of affected users of such checks are actually not U.S. persons at all, but we have to take those actions to do what we can to not have actual U.S. persons on the platform,\" said Jansen.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/options\/aggregated-open-interest-of-bitcoin-options\/embed\" title=\"Aggregated Open Interest of Bitcoin Options\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>"],"hashtag":[]}
