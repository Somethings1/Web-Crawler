In the same year, before becoming SEC Chair, Gary Gensler also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/115\/meeting\/house\/108562\/witnesses\/HHRG-115-AG00-Wstate-GenslerG-20180718.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">testified<\/a> to Congress that ether is not a security, Grewal added.","Recent comparisons between ether and bitcoin by the SEC\u2019s own trial lawyers in the case against Ripple Labs, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and federal courts' confirmation of ether as a commodity and the ether futures contracts which started trading on CFTC-regulated futures exchanges in 2021, were additional arguments against the classification of ether as a security, Grewal said.","\u201CThe SEC has no good reason to deny the ETH ETP applications. And we hope they won\u2019t try to invent one by questioning the long established regulatory status of ETH, which the SEC has repeatedly endorsed. That\u2019s not how the law works. And Americans deserve better,\u201D Grewal said.","Furthermore, the Coinbase CLO added that the SEC\u2019s Howey Test doesn\u2019t determine ether\u2019s status either. \u201CDigital assets like ether that do not involve an ongoing contractual obligation related to a business enterprise are not \u2018investment contracts\u2019 or otherwise \u2018securities.\u2019\u201D Even if the test was applied, ether fails it anyway, he argued.","Yesterday, The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/283686\/ethereum-foundation-has-received-a-confidential-enquiry-from-a-state-authority-shows-github-commit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that the Ethereum Foundation \u2014 a non-profit based in Switzerland that helps support the Ethereum ecosystem \u2014 had removed a \"Warrant Canary\" from its website following a voluntary and confidential enquiry from an unspecified state authority, according to the Foundation's <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ethereum\/ethereum-foundation-website\/commit\/769b30603504b4b5e8f601f8014691a8d1821390\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">GitHub<\/a> repository.","\"This commit removes a section of the footer as we have received a voluntary enquiry from a state authority that included a requirement for confidentiality,\" said Pablo Pettinari, a front-end developer at the Ethereum Foundation, in a commit on Feb. 26.","The removed \"Warrant Canary\" image represented that the Ethereum Foundation had not been contacted by an agency in a way that required contact not to be disclosed. It also removed text that said, \"The Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum) has never been contacted by any agency anywhere in the world in a way which requires that contact not to be disclosed.\"","Historical records from the Wayback Machine indicate that the canary and its message were still visible on the Foundation's website as recently as January.","Meanwhile, Fortune <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/283753\/sec-subpoenaed-firms-that-dealt-with-the-ethereum-foundation-fortune\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that the SEC seems to be \"waging an energetic legal campaign to classify Ethereum as a security\" \u2014 citing crypto companies that have received subpoenas connected to an Ethereum-related investigation.","Individuals from companies receiving the subpoenas said the inquiries were highly-specific to the Ethereum Foundation. In addition, some firms received subpoenas recently, while others obtained theirs after Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus system in September 2022 in a transition dubbed \"The Merge.\"","In contrast to Grewal\u2019s view on the SEC\u2019s stance throughout Ethereum\u2019s history, others see the <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/CoinDesk\/status\/1552738783736512512?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">switch to PoS<\/a> as a key differentiator, with the probe raising questions about whether it is part of a broader push to classify ether as a security \u2014 potentially dashing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/275174\/sec-ethereum-etf-approval-may-standard-chartered-bank\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hopes<\/a> that the regulator will approve spot Ethereum ETFs in the coming months.","\u201CThis situation to me is a case of 'where there's smoke there may actually be fire,\u2019\u201D Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/JSeyff\/status\/1770506432976175235?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> yesterday, responding to the news.","Shortly after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/166708\/the-merge-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ethereums-big-upgrade\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Merge<\/a>, Gensler <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172097\/proof-of-security-gensler-eyes-proof-of-stake-after-the-merge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> that tokens in a PoS consensus system could be considered securities since investors rely on the efforts of others to make a profit.","However, crypto lawyer Preston Byrne <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/prestonjbyrne\/status\/1770497285224321303?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> on Wednesday, \u201CIf the SEC is going to try to undermine Ethereum's claim that it's like Bitcoin, it's going to do so by reference to the distribution of coins in the presale.\u201D","The ETF Store President Nate Geraci <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/NateGeraci\/status\/1770269002025119929?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> that when contemplating potential SEC disapproval of spot Ethereum ETFs, it is useful to look back to Commissioner Hester Peirce\u2019s comments following spot Bitcoin ETF approval.","Peirce said at the time that the agency\u2019s \u201Carbitrary and capricious treatment of applications in the area will continue to harm our reputation far beyond crypto,\u201D adding that, \u201CBy failing to follow our normal standards and processes in considering spot Bitcoin ETFs, we have created an artificial frenzy around them.\u201D","\u201CI\u2019ll remind you that investors can currently buy futures-based Ethereum ETFs,\u201D Geraci added.","Former CFTC commissioner and Global Head of Policy at a16z crypto Brian Quintenz seemingly agrees. \u201CWhen the SEC allowed ETH futures ETFs to trade on its regulated security exchanges, it explicitly acknowledged the status of the underlying, ETH, as being a non-security and outside of its jurisdiction,\u201D he <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/BrianQuintenz\/status\/1770541103667929161?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">posted<\/a> on X yesterday.","Quintenz pointed out that the Ethereum futures ETF approval decision was made in October 2023 \u2014 well after Ethereum changed to PoS in September 2022. \u201CIf the SEC had any doubt about the regulatory treatment of ETH in Oct 2023, it wouldn\u2019t have approved the ETF. Moreover, if ETH were a security, then the ETH futures ETF would be an illegal instrument. The SEC cannot approve an illegal instrument to trade over a national securities exchange,\u201D he said.","\u201CIt will be interesting to watch what, if any, excuse the SEC uses if it were to delay or deny an ETH ETF given it has already informed the market on ETH being outside its jurisdiction,\u201D Quintenz added. \u201CThe SEC's conduct in refusing to acknowledge these facts is causing confusion and actively harming the public.\u201D","Intially optimistic, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seffart recently reduced their expectations for spot ETF approvals to <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/EricBalchunas\/status\/1770453011321495889?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">25%<\/a> by May 23 \u2014 the final deadline for the SEC to rule on a spot Ethereum ETF application from Ark and 21Shares, the first that was filed.","The analysts cited differences in the comments process from the SEC leading up to the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals compared to the spot Ethereum ETF application timeline.","\u201CBitcoin spot comments from the SEC came 91 days before the final deadline. We are currently 65 days away from the Ethereum ETF deadline.
