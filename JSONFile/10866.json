This comprises the biggest protocol change to ever occur on the Lisk blockchain, and marks the beginning of a whole new era for the Lisk network as it eliminates all weaknesses of the Lisk Mainnet v2 related to fees, consensus algorithm and accounts, and also prepares and improves the Lisk blockchain for the upcoming interoperability release in many regards.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This section provides an overview of the new and updated features which are now available on the new Lisk Mainnet v3.&nbsp;<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Did you know that with Lisk v3 you have an extremely secure new account address system, with built-in error detection for typos? No need for account initialization anymore! We give our community complete security.<\/span><\/i>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The old address and ID system has been replaced and all existing accounts have been automatically migrated to the new system. This introduces a longer address, decreasing user experiences of address collisions and ensuring that such addresses are resistant to preimage attacks. In addition, this also eliminates the need to initialize a new account, as was required in the old Mainnet v2, ensuring that every new account in the Lisk network is completely secure right from the start.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The following credentials of your account have not changed:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hence, you can still use your old passphrase to log in to Lisk Desktop as before.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The following credentials of your account have changed:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The new address is created from the public key as described in the illustration shown below.

This also enables users to overwrite their transactions in the transaction pool (i.e. transactions which are not included in the block yet), by setting a higher fee and the same nonce as the transaction they wish to overwrite. The minimum fee of each transaction is always burned to secure the system against various game theoretic attack scenarios.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">More information about dynamic fees can be found in the following blog posts: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lisk.com\/blog\/research\/lisks-dynamic-fee-system\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lisk's Dynamic Fee System<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lisk.com\/blog\/research\/static-vs-dynamic-fee-system-comparison-both\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Static vs Dynamic Fee System: A Comparison of Both<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Did you know that with Lisk v3 the DPoS consensus algorithm received an entire revamp?
