Coinbase said the SEC\u2019s effort to classify \u201Ca simple asset sale as a security is an unprecedented stretch,\u201D and that a judge\u2019s recent decision with Ripple bolsters their argument.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC and Ripple have been embroiled in a legal fight since 2020, when the agency <\/span><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion in 2020 through the sale of XRP, which it says is an unregistered security.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Last month, a judge ruled that some of Ripple\u2019s sales of XRP did not violate securities laws because of a blind bid process in place for them, so buyers did not know the sales benefited Ripple. The judge ruled that other direct sales of the token to institutional investors were securities.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIn this case, by contrast, the SEC has charged Coinbase based solely on blind, bid-ask, spot exchange transactions\u2014the very sort of transactions the Ripple court recently held as a matter of law were not investment contracts because the undisputed facts showed no relevant relationship between the parties to the sale,\u201D Coinbase said in the brief.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The judge\u2019s decision in Ripple was seen as a win for the crypto industry, but a different judge slammed that decision in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/242381\/judge-slams-ripple-decision-in-secs-case-against-terraform-labs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">separate<\/span><\/a> case involving the SEC and Terraform Labs on Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase also argued that the major questions doctrine, which has been cited a few times in the crypto industry, applied to its case against the SEC. The doctrine says that if an agency wants to decide on an issue that has major national significance, it has to be supported by clear congressional authorization.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The major questions doctrine has two parts \u2014 one focused on whether the subject has a major impact on the nation\u2019s economy or on the public, and the second is whether a federal agency has explicit authority to implement new regulations.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Terraform\u2019s lawyers also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/242381\/judge-slams-ripple-decision-in-secs-case-against-terraform-labs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cited<\/span><\/a> the major questions doctrine, though the judge rejected that argument, saying that the crypto industry falls short of bearing \u201Cvast economic and political significance.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe major questions principle applies directly here,\u201D Coinbase said on Friday. \u201CThe wholesale regulation of secondary markets for trading digital assets qualifies as \u2018extraordinary,\u2019 and the digital asset industry, worth around $1 trillion, is a \u2018significant portion of the American economy.\u2019\u201D<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe SEC\u2019s authority is clear as mud,\u201D Coinbase added.&nbsp;<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
