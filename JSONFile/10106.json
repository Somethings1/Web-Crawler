Don Verrilli, lead counsel for Grayscale, said during oral arguments in March that the SEC is contradicting itself by allowing bitcoin futures ETFs, but not a spot bitcoin ETF.","The asset manager sent a letter to the SEC last month, asking to meet with regulators to discuss converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into a spot bitcoin ETF.","\"We hope you will agree that the best use of resources now is for the Commission to issue an order approving NYSE Arca\u2019s Rule 19b-4 filing and authorize the staff to work with Grayscale and NYSE Arca to finalize the prompt listing of the Trust\u2019s shares,\" lawyers for Grayscale said at the time.","The SEC has not yet greenlit a spot bitcoin ETF, though the initial Grayscale ruling was seen as a positive signal for the wave of applications for spot funds that have come over the past year from big names including BlackRock and Fidelity.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Late last month, the regulator<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/253620\/sec-continues-filing-frenzy-delaying-bitcoin-etfs-from-fidelity-vaneck-and-wisdomtree\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> moved to delay<\/a> all pending applications for spot bitcoin ETFs with an extended comment period that will keep the process going for at least another month.","Sui Chung, the CEO of Kraken-subsidiary CF Benchmarks that provides the index set to be used by some of the proposed spot bitcoin ETFs, told The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255560\/gold-etfs-could-shed-light-on-the-secs-thinking-about-proposals-for-spot-bitcoin-funds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">earlier this month<\/a> that there were a number of issues the SEC might still be looking at.&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"<\/b>BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and the respective stock exchanges, they are seeking to list the ETFs,\" he said. \"They seem pretty confident, otherwise they wouldn't have filed with what they put into their response. So they seem pretty confident that it will work.
