Despite a consistent decrease in BTC holdings on exchanges, the FTX debacle triggered an even sharper decline. Prior to its November 2022 bankruptcy declaration, exchanges held 2.511 million BTC, but withdrawals have since reached 487,000 BTC. In just the last three months (since May 23, 2023) around 184,000 BTC left centralized exchanges. The exact reasons for these withdrawals remain uncertain, but the benefits of self-custody are evident.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Forging Crypto\u2019s First Entirely-Decentralized Self-Custodial Exchange:<\/b>","<a href=\"https:\/\/wefunder.com\/swopblock\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Swopblock<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, an ember in the crypto landscape, is poised to emerge as a chosen haven for users seeking unparalleled control.
