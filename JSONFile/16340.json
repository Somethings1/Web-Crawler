{"summary":"The second-largest stablecoin in crypto has restored its dollar peg after a tumultuous weekend, but it shows how important the token is in the ecosystem.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/learn\/why-stablecoin-usdcs-unstable-weekend-matters\/","publishDate":"2023-03-14T14:22:19","id":16340,"type":null,"title":"Why Stablecoin USDC\u2019s Unstable Weekend Matters","category":["Learn"],"content":["Crypto markets are still reeling from a turbulent weekend, after one of the market\u2019s leading stablecoins, Circle\u2019s USD coin (USDC), lost its 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar and plunged to as low as 87 cents. USDC restored its peg on Monday and continues to hover close to $1 as of writing, but the crisis might have broader implications for crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi).","On Friday, Circle confirmed it had been holding $3.3 billion of its reserves at the failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Many USDC holders suspected potential consequences from the SVB crash and quickly redeemed over $1 billion of USDC for U.S. dollars, causing the USDC price to lose the peg. Late Friday, the Coinbase crypto exchange, the largest based in the U.S., paused customers\u2019 ability to convert USDC to dollars until Monday morning, when U.S. banks were open.","As a result, USDC market capitalization dropped to the lowest point over the past year, to $39.5 billion (USDC\u2019s highest point was last summer at $55.9 billion). USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, following tether (USDT) at $72.4 billion, according to CoinGecko. Tether gained about $2 billion in market capitalization since Friday, likely profiting from its closest rival\u2019s troubles because USDT was not affected by SVB\u2019s collapse.","On Sunday, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted that Circle would be transferring $3.3 billion of its funds from SVB to BNY Mellon.","Allaire also noted the problems Circle endured from the crash of another crypto-friendly bank, Signature Bank. When Signature has been shut down by state regulators, Circle could no longer use the bank\u2019s SigNet settlement network. Allaire tweeted that Circle would switch to the service by Cross River Bank immediately.","On Monday, USDC restored its dollar peg.","USDC has been a crucial part of the DeFi economy. In DeFi, people use stablecoins to buy other tokens as well as to speculate on stablecoins\u2019 own fluctuating value, said Andrew Thurman, head of content at a blockchain analytics firm Nansen.","\u201CMany of the top decentralized exchange pools have USDC in one of the [trading] pairs, cross-chain bridges are heavily weighted towards USDC, other stablecoins such as DAI and FRAX have significant (if not majority) USDC collateral and it's a popular collateral type on lending marketplaces,\u201D Thurman told CoinDesk.","Tether\u2019s USDT, despite its leading position on the market, is not as popular for those use cases, Thurman added, possibly because USDC has been traditionally perceived as more transparent and less risky than USTD. How Tether maintains its reserves has been a long-standing question in the industry, and the company has repeatedly dodged requests to reveal which assets are backing its stablecoin.","See Also: Fiat-Backed Stablecoins: What You Need to Know About Tether, USD Coin and Others","Andriy Velikiy, co-founder of token swap service Allbridge, told CoinDesk USDC is especially popular among crypto startups operating in the U.S. and Europe due to its good reputation and lack of regulatory issues to date.","\u201CUSDC is this official, fully backed stablecoin, and if you\u2019re raising funds in the U.S. an American fund would be comfortable sending you USDC and you would be comfortable keeping it,\u201D Velikiy said.","Outside of the West, Velikiy noted, the most popular stablecoin is USDT, which is broadly used in cross-border trade among China, Vietnam and Eastern Europe. \u201CTraditionally, the entire market in Eastern Europe is running on USDT on the Tron blockchain.\u201D","One man\u2019s crisis is another man\u2019s opportunity, and many traders rushed to make some money on USDC\u2019s Friday crash, Velikiy said. He said on Allbridge the daily volume of USDC went up by 10 times on Friday night.","\u201CPeople were trying to get rid of USDC at any price, they were swapping it for other assets and running between centralized exchanges and DeFi pools until the pools\u2019 liquidity was drained and USDC was trading on DeFi platforms with the same discount as on centralized exchanges,\u201D he said.","Velikiy said the wildfire did not spread with the same speed in all parts of the crypto ecosystem at once, so during several hours on Friday night there was a window for arbitrage between centralized exchanges and DeFi pools, because the price of USDC was higher on platforms where traders hasn\u2019t withdrawn liquidity yet.","Read More: Crypto Arbitrage Trading: How to Make Low-Risk Gains","The price gap closed on the most popular DeFi platforms quickly, but savvy traders were still taking advantage of a price gap on Tezos, where USDC was still trading at 96 cents while Ethereum-based USDC had slipped to 90 cents. \u201CPeople who know how to move between different chains could make money on that,\u201D Velikiy explained.","At the same time, many used an opportunity to pay back their USDC-denominated DeFi loans at a lower price; Aave and Compound repayments surged on Saturday, said Axios reporter Brady Dale. In this case, they could buy USDC to pay back their loans much cheaper than before.","\u201CThis weekend I asked if folks were paying back DeFi loans like crazy because of an effective discount on the debt. Looks like: Yes, yes they were,\u201D Dale tweeted.","There are not many alternatives to USDC\u2019s current role on the market, given all the circumstances, said Velikiy. One reason, he said, is USDT does not look reliable enough for USDC holders.","Another previously popular stablecoin, Binance\u2019s BUSD, has been in regulators\u2019 crosshairs since February, when the New York Department of Financial Services questioned its legality and ordered Paxos to stop minting the currency.","Stablecoins DAI and FRAX, on the other hand, rely on USDC for their reserves (they are backed by other cryptocurrencies, not dollars in a bank account), and algorithmic stablecoins lost trust after the crash of Terra's terraUSD stablecoin.","\"After the most reliable and regulated stablecoin lost 10% of value in one night, some people will just quit crypto,\u201D Velikiy said, which could make the USDC market cap fall by more.","According to Nansen\u2019s Thurman, classic volatile crypto assets like bitcoin and ether are currently on the rise, especially among the institutional players. \u201CUnbacked crypto assets such as BTC and ETH are ripping. Indeed, smart money is leveraging up to buy more, while they're ignoring an asset backed by the fractional reserve banking system, USDC,\u201D Thurman said.","Has the crypto industry gone full circle, going from not trusting the traditional financial system to relying on it for stability and regulatory calm to not trusting banks again? It's one possibility.","\u201CUp until very recently, investors were thrilled with the idea of having safe dollars on-chain. Now they're reconsidering what \"safe\" means in the context of banks collapsing,\u201D Thurman said.","See also: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite \u2018Moral Hazard\u2019 Dilemma Bitcoin Was Designed to End"],"entity":[{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thurman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Signature Bank Reignite \u2018Moral Hazard\u2019 Dilemma Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Silicon Valley Bank (SVB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eastern Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Brady Dale","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nansen\u2019s Thurman","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Saturday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USDT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York Department of Financial Services","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SigNet","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"night","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Signature Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SVB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Circle","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Silicon Valley Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USTD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vietnam","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"FRAX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"weekend","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$55.9 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"90 cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Andrew Thurman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"87 cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tezos","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nansen","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jeremy Allaire","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Andriy Velikiy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$39.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Coinbase crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Velikiy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"This weekend","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BNY Mellon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$72.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"CoinGecko","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cross River Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fiat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"96 cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Learn","Beginner","Circle","Stablecoin","Cryptocurrency","Explainer","USDC"],"authors":["Anna Baydakova"]}
