One software engineer, a recent college graduate, said they passed up offers from all three to work instead of at Coinbase.","Another software engineer who said he signed his Coinbase Cloud offer in mid-May was days away from leaving his job on Wall Street: He was at a going-away happy hour with work friends when the rescission email hit. Now, he\u2019s staying put.","Many of the potentially hundreds of downturned prospects weren\u2019t so lucky. The college grad was planning on starting in September.","\u201CNow I\u2019m scrambling to get something, and most companies are either filled up or frozen hiring,\u201D the grad said.","Coinbase announced earlier this year it intended to triple its headcount through the end of 2022.

One individual said they were a new graduate who interviewed in November.","According to a copy of an email sent to this person from Brock, they will receive one month\u2019s salary as severance.","Other users said their start date was meant to be June 6, just four days after Brock\u2019s blog post.","Coinbase\u2019s stock price traded around $67 Friday, down 9% over the day amid a broader fall in tech stocks."],"entity":[{"type":"Brock","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$67","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Coinbase Chief People Officer L.J.
