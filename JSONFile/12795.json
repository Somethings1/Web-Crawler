The vault relied on an admin address, which was targeted to extract the private key to move the funds.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wintermute\u2019s hacked admin account was a \u201Cvanity address,\u201D a type of crypto address containing identifiable names or numbers within them \u2014 or which have a particular style \u2014 and can be generated using certain online tools including Profanity.

The firm went on to determine that it too could extract the private key belonging to Wintermute\u2019s vanity address and estimate the hardware and time requirements to crack the address generated by Profanity.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In its independent analysis, Amber explained that Profanity relied on a particular algorithm to generate large sets of public and private addresses that had certain desirable characters. The Profanity tool created millions of addresses per second and searched for the desired letters or digits that were requested by users as custom wallet addresses. Still, the process used to generate those addresses lacked randomness, and private keys could be reverse-calculated with GPUs.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe figured out how Profanity divides the job on GPUs. Based on that, we can efficiently compute the private key of any public key generated by Profanity. We pre-compute a public key table, then do reverse computation until we find the public key in the table,\u201D Amber Group said.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
