Teneo and 3AC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The allegations were reportedly discussed during a meeting with 3AC\u2019s creditors on Tuesday. The Block was first to reveal, in July last year, that 3AC owed its creditors <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/158169\/three-arrows-capital-3ac-creditors-list-3-5-billion-crypto-affidavits\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">more than $3.5 billion<\/a> when it collapsed.","Both Zhu and Davies went quiet in the weeks following their fund\u2019s implosion, but gradually made a return first to social media and later to entrepreneurship.","The pair teamed up with Mark Lamb, founder of CoinFLEX, the crypto lender that filed for restructuring in the Seychelles last year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/224781\/su-zhu-opnx-launches-token-giveaway\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">to launch a new business named OPNX<\/a>. Among other things, it aims to allow users to trade bankruptcy claims. 3AC's liquidators, meanwhile, have repeatedly complained about Zhu and Davies' lack of cooperation.&nbsp;","According to Bloomberg\u2019s report, 3AC\u2019s liquidators accuse Zhu and Davies of taking on \u201Csignificant leverage\u201D between May and June 2022, after the fund had taken a major hit from bets on luna tokens and other crypto investments. At that point, liquidators believe 3AC was already insolvent, the report states, adding that liquidators are now taking action against the pair in a British Virgin Islands court to recover those losses.","Â© 2023 The Block.
