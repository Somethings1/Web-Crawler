It did not disclose investment amounts in the seven startups.","This marks the conclusion of the season 6 program that began last December. The incubation program initially included 12 startups but ultimately invested in seven. A Binance Labs spokesperson told The Block that the firm doesn't invest in all startups it incubates, noting that the incubation is designed to support founders, with investments not guaranteed.","Binance Labs' incubation Season 5, for instance, invested in five startups last year, including zkPass, Mind Network and DappOS, from the total 12 it first selected.","The season 7 program is set to launch soon. \"We're currently looking for forward-thinking founders of early-stage projects to join the program,\" Binance Labs said, adding that the application process \"will be open on a rolling basis.\"","A significant number of projects apply for Binance Labs' incubation programs. Binance Labs said the season 6 program received \"hundreds\" of applications and ultimately selected 12 startups, or around 3% of the applicants.","Binance Labs has recently increased its investment activity, backing Bitcoin staking protocol <a href=\"https:\/\/mta-sts.theblock.co\/post\/279344\/binance-labs-bitcoin-staking-protocol-babylon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Babylon<\/a> and Ethereum restaking protocols <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278564\/binance-labs-renzo-ethereum-restaking\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Renzo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/275102\/binance-labs-puffer-investment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Puffer Finance<\/a> this year.","Last year, Binance Labs accepted its first external capital when it closed a $500 million fund. The firm, however, began returning undeployed capital to Limited partners.
