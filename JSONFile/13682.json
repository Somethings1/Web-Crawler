They have little understanding of what it means to have some financial plans.\"&nbsp;","Despite record levels of capital <a href=\"https:\/\/www.galaxy.com\/research\/insights\/2022-crypto-vc-comes-down-to-earth\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">allocated<\/a> to web3 VCs last year, crypto projects only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/research\/january-blockchain-funding-recap-209442\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">received<\/a> $631 million in funding last month compared to $4.3 billion in February of last year, per The Block Research.&nbsp;","Web3 accelerators such as Tatum's have begun to gather steam as venture capitalists assess the market and take more time to deploy.&nbsp;","In December, Polgon co-founder Sandeep Naiwal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/196492\/polygon-co-founder-launches-web3-startup-accelerator-beacon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> Beacon, a web3 accelerator attached to his venture capital firm Symbolic Capital.&nbsp;That followed web3 accelerator initiatives by a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/197641\/hong-kong-accelerator-looking-to-help-1000-web3-startups-in-next-3-years\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council,<\/a> and even conglomerates like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179577\/meta-loreal-web3-startup-accelerator\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meta<\/a> and L'Oréal.

That's a small ticket compared to other web3 accelerators, with Outlier Ventures offering $100,000 and a16z's crypto startup school's half a million.","Kobelka was quick to note, however, that founders also receive a free Tatum license for 12 months, worth $40,000, free of charge. While the program will be less structured than a typical accelerator, there's also access to mentoring, and personalized intros to time-short investors. Also, contacts at blockchain networks and Participants can leverage Tatum's position in the market.&nbsp;","Kobelka claims that, through its product offering and the companies its serves, the firm can easily discern the latest trends and goings-on in the crypto sector \u2014 even letting participants know which chains are being used, and how, ahead of the competition.&nbsp;","The startup CEO said projects could be early stage with a working demo across any web3 subsector \u2014 \"anything which is not illegal is fine.\" Currently, there are around five projects accepted into the program with the aim of bumping that to 4o participants.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
