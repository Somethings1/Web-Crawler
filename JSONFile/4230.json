Part of this was caused by an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/223056\/binance-withdrawals-increase-after-cftc-suit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">initial flurry<\/a> of small withdrawals in the first hour following the news.","Yet, during the same time period, $1.3 billion of cryptocurrency was sent to the exchange \u2014 meaning a net outflow of $900 million.","\u201CNo real sign of a bank run yet, feels like fears around this have been much lower than the whole solvency fears period at the end of last year,\u201D said Nansen Data Journalist Martin Lee in a Telegram message.","Lee noted that Binance has seen higher than normal withdrawals over the last few weeks, with average daily withdrawals of $385 million \u2014 in terms of Ethereum-based tokens. He added that $1.3 billion of withdrawals took place on the day of the CFTC news, but this was well under the $3 billion that left the exchange on Dec. 13, 2022.","\u201CI've seen a lot of bombastic headlines about the outflows Binance has experienced but they are actually less than normal,\u201D said Tom Dunleavy, founder of Dunleavy Investment Research and former senior research analyst at Messari, in a Twitter DM.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance's inflows and outflows over the last year.

No signs of a bank run and with those numbers it would be extremely unlikely,\u201D he added.","Binance's wallets are largely filled with stablecoins and top cryptocurrencies. The stablecoin tether makes up 28.7% of its reserves, according to crypto data provider Nansen, while bitcoin makes up 23.5% and ether 12.4%. These are followed by BUSD and BNB. These five holdings make up 80% of the cryptocurrencies in Binance's wallets.","<span data-v-1830fd1a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The lawsuit claimed that Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, still served U.S. customers and tried to increase its presence in the region, despite public assertions that it was not available to U.S. customers. It claims that Binance executives replaced data referring to U.S. customers with the word \"UNKWN,\" short for unknown.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
