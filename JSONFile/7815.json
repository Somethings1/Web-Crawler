Previously, customers such as Airbnb and Carta were able to earn rewards points on Brex and the companies could redeem them for flight miles, cash or travel.","\u201CAnd now instead of redeeming them for cashback or miles you can also redeem them in crypto, in bitcoin and [ether], and we\u2019re really excited about it,\u201D Henrique Dubugras, Brex\u2019s co-founder and co-CEO, told The Block.","\u201CA lot of businesses have all these unredeemed points that just stay there doing nothing forever. So instead of having them in points, have them in crypto, a possibly appreciating asset,\u201D he added.","Brex\u2019s rewards partner Travelbank will support the new crypto functionality. Travelbank itself has a partnership with crypto exchange Coinbase, which will provide the wallets needed to store, hold or exchange any crypto accrued by Brex\u2019s customers.","More than the recent crypto bull run, the acceleration in corporate adoption of bitcoin as a treasury asset persuaded Brex to take the plunge into the sector. Companies such as Square, Tesla and MicroStrategy have been at the vanguard of this movement.","\u201CWe were always personally big believers in crypto but we didn\u2019t know when crypto would cross to the business world. And I think when big corporations like Square and Tesla started buying crypto on their balance sheet is when we said, \u2018ok, this is now getting into our world and it\u2019s time to make a move,\u2019\u201D said Dubugras.","Asked whether Brex itself holds any exposure to cryptocurrency, Dubugras told The Block, \u201CNot yet, but coming soon.\u201D","\u201CWe\u2019re still figuring out our options but it\u2019s something we\u2019re definitely considering,\u201D he added. A spokesperson would not elaborate further on Brex\u2019s plans to acquire crypto exposure.","Brex came out of the Y Combinator accelerator program in 2017 and has since grown to employ more than 600 people.
