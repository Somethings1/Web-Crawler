For a decade, the bank largely operated as a single-industry lender, and the OIG concluded that this change in course should have required a different type of registration that its government supervisors failed to demand. And there were several problems that Fed examiners were too slow to deal with as the bank headed toward its voluntary wind-down in March after last year\u2019s crypto mayhem shattered its customers.","\u201CExaminers should have taken more aggressive and decisive supervisory action to escalate several issues in light of the bank\u2019s unchecked growth; its volatile funding and deposit concentrations; and its significant, pervasive, and persistent weaknesses in key control functions,\u201D the report found.","Under the banking regulations, Silvergate should have filed an application with the Fed when it pivoted into full-time crypto, the OIG concluded. But the California bank\u2019s examiners had decided that because it was still taking in deposits and making loans to its customers, Silvergate remained a standard commercial bank and was never pushed to set up new risk protections to match its overhauled strategy.","Silvergate\u2019s problems also extended to its \u201Cineffective\u201D senior management that was beset by nepotism, according to the OIG, which issued its findings last week. The report didn\u2019t detail the nepotism allegations, but former CEO Alan Lane had taken heavy criticism for employing multiple members of his family in senior roles.","\u201CThe bank\u2019s corporate governance and risk management capabilities did not keep pace with the bank\u2019s rapid growth, increasing complexity, and evolving risk profile,\u201D the report concluded.","Its move to voluntarily liquidate means Silvergate didn\u2019t technically fail, and no government intervention was required to pay back depositors.","The OIG made several internal recommendations for how Fed examiners should handle similar situations in the future, though, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors has agreed to develop new and expanded guidance on rapidly growing banks that change their focus.","Read More: How Silvergate\u2019s Crypto Collapse Differed From Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s: No Bailout"],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alan Lane","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"OIG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federal Reserve\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March after last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"How Silvergate\u2019s Crypto Collapse Differed From Silicon Valley Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federal Reserve Board of Governors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Silvergate","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Silvergate Bank","Banking","Federal Reserve","California"],"authors":["Jesse Hamilton"]}
