Centralized exchanges, including Bybit, Binance, Bitfinex and OKX, subsequently began offering trading for the token.","JUP is currently trading at $0.60, according to The Block\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/275404\/jupiter-jup-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">price page<\/a> \u2014 up 50% from its initial trading price. That gives it a market cap of $808 million and a fully diluted value of $6 billion.","Some 1.35 billion tokens, or 13.5% of its total 10 billion supply, are in circulation at launch.","Jupiter opened its initial token airdrop at the same time. The retrospective airdrop rewards early users who traded at least $1,000 on the platform before Nov. 2, targeting 955,000 wallet addresses. Currently, 62.9% of JUP tokens have been claimed across over 450,000 addresses, <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/jhackworth\/jupiter-airdrop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to a Dune Analytics dashboard.","In total, the project plans to airdrop four billion tokens, or 40% of Jupiter\u2019s total supply, to users over four phases. According to Jupiter, future airdrop rounds will also reward new users.","The token launch has not passed without its controversy. Some users <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/Lord_Ashdrake\/status\/1752894684031008957?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">complained<\/a> about the token launch pool being used by the team to sell tokens to the public.","In response, the project\u2019s pseudonymous founder, Meow, <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/weremeow\/status\/1752954292313686178?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> the team was transparent about the mechanics of the launch pool. The founder claimed that the team\u2019s sales ratio was reduced from 20% to 5%, then to 2.5% of the token supply. Meow added that the team could have raised more funds if it had wanted to via an initial DEX offering or over-the-counter sales \u2014 implying that it chose a more transparent approach.","\u201CBy doing it this way, airdrop recipients get a massive pool to constantly sell into, while prospective buyers have assurance that there is a big pool to absorb big selling pressure from airdrops that will cause them immediate massive rekt,\u201D Meow said.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
