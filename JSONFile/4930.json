The majority of the exploits happened on Ethereum \u2014 34 to be precise \u2014 with Binance Smart Chain a close runner-up with 25 attacks. We also saw three on Polygon and two on Avalanche.","Out of the attacks, 34 of them employed flash loans. These are loans that are taken out, used for some function and repaid all in the same transaction block. This means the lender knows their money will be returned (or it was never borrowed in the first place).","As a result, flash loans can be very large at a low cost, enabling hackers to borrow huge amounts of funds in order to maximize the damage of such attacks. (For a detailed analysis of the pros and cons of flash loans, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/108081\/flash-loans-a-blessing-or-a-curse\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">see here<\/a>.)","For example, DeFi protocol xToken suffered an exploit in May. The perpetrator used a flash loan to borrow 61,800 ETH ($270 million) to upset the system and take off with $24.5 million. The sheer size of the flash loan made the attack more profitable.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/exploits\/stolen-funds-by-using-flash-loans\/embed\" title=\"Stolen funds by using flash loans\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Three of the five biggest hacks were for Poly Network, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/114045\/at-least-611-million-stolen-in-massive-cross-chain-hack\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lost $611 million<\/a> in total before it was then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/114390\/poly-network-hacker-returns-nearly-all-of-the-611-million-in-stolen-funds?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">all returned<\/a>.
