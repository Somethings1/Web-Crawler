OpenSea was contacted for comment but did not respond by press time.","One of DAO Turtles\u2019 founders told The Block that they too are unsure how they had breached OpenSea\u2019s terms, but insisted that they had done nothing illegal. The team has now altered language on its website that had promised to pay a percentage of future NFT projects to DAO Turtle owners. It still promises to give each NFT holder a \u201CTurtleshell token,\u201D and to incentivize users in a \u201Cnon-commercial manner\u201D to quiet concerns about securities rules.","OpenSea's move may have big implications for NFTs, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/nft-sales-surge-107-bln-q3-crypto-asset-frenzy-hits-new-highs-2021-10-04\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hit $10.7 billion in sales volume<\/a> in the third quarter of this year.","Since the DAO Turtle ban, Twitter users have <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Lucky5Micah\/status\/1446314740095934464\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pointed out<\/a> that other big-name NFT projects would also appear to be in breach of OpenSea\u2019s rules.","Concerns about the attachment of NFTs to financial products has led some to suggest that they could come to be viewed as securities. For its upcoming NFT marketplace, crypto exchange FTX will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/120016\/why-ftxs-upcoming-marketplace-is-avoiding-nfts-that-offer-royalties\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">eschew projects that offer royalties<\/a>.","Brett Harrison, president of FTX.US, said that \u201Ca token which guarantees you a percentage income stream from the sales of a pool of assets starts to look like a security.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
