With a CBDC, central banks and regulators could achieve greater transparency and increase the visibility of transactions while protecting the privacy of individuals,\" Demidova said in an emailed statement to The Block.","\u201CFor example, aggregated data can be used by central banks and governments in real time to analyze the health of the economy. Should the Bank of England press ahead with a Digital Pound, proper safeguards will need to be in place to respect end-user privacy,\" she added.","FIS is a global financial services company.

It\u2019s likely that the launch of a CBDC will require time and, most importantly, it will require careful planning.\u201D","Demidova\u2019s remarks come as the Bank of England\u2019s consultation on a potential Digital Pound \u2014 which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/209304\/uks-bank-of-england-launches-digital-pound-project-as-new-form-of-money\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">began<\/a> in February \u2014 came to an end on June 30. Demidova\u2019s comments echoed those of the Bank of England's head of strategy and architecture William Lovell last month in a <a href=\"https:\/\/thepaymentsassociation.org\/event\/demystifying-the-digital-pound\/?ck_subscriber_id=2103501492&amp;utm_source=convertkit&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Instructions+for+today%27s+webinar%3A+Demystifying+the+Digital+Pound%20-%2011064308\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">webinar<\/a> titled \u201CDemystifying the Digital Pound,\u201D presented by the Digital Pound Foundation and The Payments Association. \u201CNeither the government nor the Bank of England will have access to Digital Pound users' personal data,\u201D Lovell <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236124\/boe-digital-pound\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> at the time.","The Digital Pound offers a new way of providing digital money without the same risks faced under the current monetary system, according to Lovell. Under its \u201Cplatform model,\u201D the central bank wants to run the underlying ledger, leaving banks and technology companies to handle Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks while running front-end services connected to the CBDC.&nbsp;","However, the CBDC will not be completely anonymous to prevent financial crimes, would include limits on the amount of funds users can hold digitally and a final decision on its roll-out in combination with the UK Treasury may not be made for two years while it undertakes more development work, Lovell said last month.","Other countries, such as Switzerland, are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236470\/not-just-an-experiment-swiss-central-bank-to-carry-out-cbdc-pilot\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">developing<\/a> CBDC pilots and the European Commission also recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236925\/european-commission-outlines-vision-for-digital-euro\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">outlined<\/a> its vision for a Digital Euro.
