The good news?

The platform will provide developers of carbon and nature credits with a low-barrier, intuitive way to bring their projects to market, providing full data transparency and traceability for the entire lifecycle of credits. It aims to open global credit markets to all carbon and nature developers\u2014regardless of size and location\u2014and boost the availability of capital needed to scale carbon removal and nature restoration projects to the required level.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Why Centigrade and Why Now?<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the race to limit rising temperatures, the priority is to reduce emissions.

This is in part due to doubts cast on the efficacy and durability of its inventory, but also because (in its current incarnation) it is glacially slow, inefficient and not scalable.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite the earnest efforts of its early architects, today\u2019s carbon markets are bereft. There is a lack of high quality supply, as defined by important factors like provable climate impact (can you measure it?), additionality (is it new?) and permanence (will it last?). This is in part because carbon removal companies do not have the capital they need to grow their projects. Demand and the capital that flows from it is stuck; held back by outdated, overly centralized market mechanisms that have created a lack of transparency and trust, long and laborious due diligence processes and unnecessary risk. Put another way, today\u2019s carbon markets are underperforming: they are addressing less than 1% of the problem, far from their vast and vital potential.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another problem is that carbon markets are too narrow. They have been overly focused on carbon, and the role of trees\u2014reforestation, afforestation, avoided deforestation\u2014in solving the crisis. In fact, there is a broad and diverse range of climate positive activity across the elements that make up our natural world; not only carbon, but also air, water, soil, biodiversity and the human element, sometimes referred to as equity. This is a holistic ecosystem view and something markets should fully embrace and more intentionally reflect if they are to deliver the intended environmental, human and economic impacts.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Innovating the Way Forward, Together<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So, what can be done to help modernize and scale carbon markets?<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blockchain as a Catalytic Tool<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple and other industry players recognize that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/whitepapers\/recommendations-for-the-digital-voluntary-and-regulated-carbon-markets\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blockchain can be a catalytic tool for helping global carbon markets<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> reach their full potential.
