They describe how a lack of developer knowledge, gas fees and transaction failures lock out the vast majority from creating their own NFTs.&nbsp;","\"There's loads of no-code solutions out there that help but with only creating one- or two-piece collections,\" said Bentata Chocron in an interview. \"When you launch at scale \u2014 say 10,000 \u2013 you have to deploy your own smart contract, build a website and integrate the NFT fully into it, generate your artwork and decentralize it. It's a very elaborate process that can take weeks for an experienced team.\"&nbsp;","Through Fair's solution, creators can launch NFT collections in minutes, according to the founders. Its smart queuing technology also helps to reduce gas fees and the possibility of failed transactions. The team plan to monetize by taking a 6% commission on primary sales of NFTs created through the service.&nbsp;","While the current NFT market is a far cry from the heady days of January 2022 when monthly trading volume reached $5.6 billion \u2014 last month it dipped under the $700 million mark \u2014 that hasn't stopped companies from developing in this field.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/nft-marketplace-monthly-volume\/embed\" title=\"NFT Marketplace Monthly Volume\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","In June of this year, crypto payments firm MoonPay <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/153119\/moonpay-officially-launches-utility-nft-minting-service-hypermint\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> a similar service named HyperMint which allows brands and creators to mint up to 100 million NFTs at once.
