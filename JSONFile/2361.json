He went on to say the backers are going to drive the success of this project, namely the ones providing liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">People didn't trade on ErisX because there wasn't sufficient liquidity, according to Nazarali. \"We started with two of the largest market makers in the world and we said, if we put this together, will you provide liquidity?

Instead, there will be multiple multilateral settlements across counterparties, Nazarali said. The exchange\u2019s custodian will do a delivery versus payment (DVP) settlement once all the tokens are received, ensuring every counterparty is paid.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DVP is a type of settlement method, most common in securities trading, which guarantees the transfer of securities only happens after payment has been made. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Finally, the firm's partnership with a custodian will enable more firms to hold crypto on their balance sheets, the CEO said.
