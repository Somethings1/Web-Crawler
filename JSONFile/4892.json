While Ethereum transaction fees have been as <a href=\"https:\/\/bitinfocharts.com\/comparison\/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3y\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">low as a dollar<\/a> at times, they rise considerably during periods of high demand. Current fees are $25 for a simple transaction and <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/gastracker\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">over $100<\/a> for more complex transactions.","The core goal with Hedgehog is to create an asset with a price that mirrors current transaction fee prices on Ethereum. Specifically, it will reflect the moving average price over the last 50 blocks in the blockchain. Once such an asset is created, anyone can long or short it to hedge against future transaction fee prices.","The idea behind Hedgehog is similar to that of DAI, a decentralized stablecoin with its value pegged to a dollar.","DAI is created when crypto tokens are locked up in a vault. It is overcollateralized, meaning that the value of the crypto in the vault is much greater than the value of the amount of DAI created. It also has a minting and redemption process that creates an arbitrage opportunity designed to keep the value of the asset pegged to $1.","Hedgehog operates in the same way, using overcollateralized vaults to create a derivative token called BaseFee. The only difference is that instead of pegging the asset to the dollar, it uses the arbitrage mechanism to keep it tied to the average transaction fee price.","While the protocol is currently designed for mirroring transaction fee prices, it can be applied to create other on-chain derivatives \u2014 as long as there is enough demand.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
