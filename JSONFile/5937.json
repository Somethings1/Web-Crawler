Warwick suggested a 3:1 split of SNX, followed by a buyback and subsequent burn using the Treasury\u2019s fee yield.","\u201CShould we proceed with a 3:1 split, we would have approximately 90 million additional tokens for buyback and burn, with a market price of $60 million,\u201D Warwick explained. The founder further clarified that the funds required to burn these tokens would be sourced from the treasury fee yield.","Another proposal, termed the \u201Ccore contributor alignment,\u201D seeks to incentivize project contributors by distributing Synthetix Network Tokens (SNX) as quarterly bonuses. Warwick believes this strategy could secure ongoing commitment to the protocol\u2019s success from the platform\u2019s contributors.","Additionally, Warwick proposed the allocation of SNX for trading incentives. This aims to stimulate trading volume and foster increased market activity on the Synthetix platform. Beyond this, he suggested giving SNX to stakers to boost their involvement and commitment to preserving the platform\u2019s stability.","The Synthetix platform supports decentralized derivatives trading within its liquidity pools, which currently boast a total value locked (TVL) of over <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/synthetix\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$420 million<\/a> on Ethereum and the Optimism Layer 2 network.","The purpose of presenting proposals, Warwick said, was to start a conversation and ensure the Synthetix community is kept in the loop about potential directions for the platform. The proposals will be put to a vote by the Treasury Council (TC), Synthetix\u2019s four-member governance body, which is responsible for resource allocation for the protocol\u2019s expansion and growth.","Currently, these suggestions remain in the conceptual stage, needing votes to progress. \u201CNothing has been confirmed by a Treasury Council vote yet; however, many of these proposals have garnered support within the [council],\u201D Warwick commented.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
