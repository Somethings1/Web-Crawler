As of now, audits are manually presented by teams with no representation of their authenticity on-chain.","The need for this standard arises from the losses associated with issues found in smart contracts. Specifically, in the first half of 2023, more than <a href=\"https:\/\/de.fi\/blog\/de-fi-rekt-report-over-204m-lost-in-q2-2023\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$650 million<\/a> has been lost to DeFi-related scams and hacks.","Smart contracts, which are integral to dapps, can often be vulnerable to attacks. While audits are essential for ensuring their integrity, achieving absolute security remains challenging and more robust on-chain visibility of audits needs to introduced, experts say.","\u201CWhile permissionless innovation allows anyone to build anything, for actual use cases to emerge, we need to create a layer that will enable us to verify the security of contracts that interact. This visibility is currently missing,\u201D said Richard Meissner, co-founder of Safe and one of the authors of ERC-7512.","The proposed ERC-7512 could potentially bridge this security verification gap, allowing developers to enable more thorough audit checks and create reputation systems around audits. This standard, if implemented, can also make it easier for users and dapps to verify rigorous audits by trusted auditors and establish an on-chain reputation system for dapps.","\u201CThe first step is to make crucial audit information available to contracts verifiably. This is the goal of ERC-7512, a standard drafted by some of the industry\u2019s best auditors and security minds. ERC-7512 is not just a one-time initiative but a catalyst for further innovation in smart contract security,\u201D Meissner added.","It is yet to be determined whether the core Ethereum developers will accept and implement ERC-7512 as a standard.","Additionally, there have been previous proposals to boost dapp security on Ethereum. For instance, in July, there was a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/237671\/ethereum-erc-7265-circuit-breaker-defi-hacks\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal<\/a> titled ERC-7265, a \u201Ccircuit breaker,\u201D that suggested protocols should insert a protective measure in their smart contracts to halt token transfers in case there is a hack.
