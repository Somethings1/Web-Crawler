Finding support at a moving average is seen as a positive signal, indicating that the asset's price has historically been supported at this level, and it may serve as a point of interest for traders looking to enter or exit positions.","Bitcoin's price appreciation comes despite a resurgent U.S. dollar index (DXY). Historically, a stronger dollar has typically disincentivized investment in risk assets, such as bitcoin.","During periods of a strengthening DXY, investors may be drawn to higher yields or lower volatility in dollar-denominated assets, making them more attractive than riskier options like bitcoin and tech stocks.","Since the beginning of February the DXY has increased by almost 3%. In the same period, bitcoin has surged by almost 24%.","The largest digital asset by market capitalization was changing hands for $52,242 at 11:25 a.m. ET, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's Price Page<\/a>.
