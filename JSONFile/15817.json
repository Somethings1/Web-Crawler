ZK Rollups use some cryptography known as \u201Czero-knowledge proofs,\u201D to ensure that a transaction is valid by only showing a small amount of information about that transaction before posting it back to the main blockchain (in this case Ethereum.)","Starknet also has native account abstraction, which allows users to access blockchains via smart-contract wallets, making the experience easier.","The integration of Starknet into Alchemy\u2019s suite could be a sign of demand from developers to build more with account abstraction. \"Alchemy makes it easy to build dapps, and Starknet provides the scale and features they need,\" said Gal Ron, a product manager and blockchain researcher at StarkWare.","\u201CNative AA unlocks a ton of flexibility and room for innovation for wallet UX,\u201D Alex Miao, a software engineer at Alchemy, told CoinDesk in an email. (\"UX\" is short for user interface.) \u201CDevelopers can incorporate customizable account permissions, build in safeguards to run at the wallet level, and create simple transaction flows. This empowers developers to build for a world where end users and businesses are always represented by a smart-contract wallet.\u201D","Read more: Ethereum Upgrade Could Make It Harder to Lose All Your Crypto","UPDATE (May 4, 2023 18:04 UTC): Adds quote from StarkWare.","Edited by Bradley Keoun."],"entity":[{"type":"Gal Ron","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 4, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Alchemy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"StarkWare","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alex Miao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Native AA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bradley Keoun","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Alchemy","Web3","developer","Developers","starknet","Zero-Knowledge Proofs"],"authors":["Margaux Nijkerk"]}
