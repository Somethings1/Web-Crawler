During Navalny's incarceration, Volkov has largely served as the mouthpiece for the opposition movement. Just last week, Russian authorities <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fedsfm.ru\/documents\/terrorists-catalog-portal-add\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">added<\/a> him and colleague Ivan Zhdanov on their register of extremists and terrorists, which bars them from much of public life as well as holding bank accounts.&nbsp;","Warning of an exodus of tech workers from Russia, Durov said: \"Such a ban will inevitably stall development of blockchain technology as a whole.\"","Durov continued:","Volkov, meanwhile, suggested that the move to attack crypto was a counterbalance to Russian security forces' incursion into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/129312\/bitcoin-mining-pool-hashrates-fall-amid-kazakhstan-internet-shutdown\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kazakhstan to help the Tokaev administration<\/a> quell civil unrest, as well as make up for lost bribe money that he says police and the regime often receive from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/111271\/why-is-the-worlds-largest-darknet-market-so-hard-to-kill\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">drug trade at the border<\/a>. Technologically, Volkov is skeptical.","\"'Banning cryptocurrency' is the same as banning a transfer from one person to another \u2014 which is to say, impossible,\" wrote Volkov, arguing that a blanket ban would just complicate transactions and send them through foreign jurisdictions. \"This is Luddism, a fight against technology and technological progress. Luddism is doomed.\"","He further took the opportunity to plug the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/btc\/address\/3QzYvaRFY6bakFBW4YBRrzmwzTnfZcaA6E\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin address through which Navalny's<\/a> team has been taking donations since 2016 \u2014 over 666 BTC in total receipts as of press time, with a fairly notable increase in incoming transactions in the past month.&nbsp;&nbsp;"],"hashtag":[]}
