Through the partnership, Amber Group will contribute its first-party crypto asset market data to the Pyth network.&nbsp;","Further improvements in DeFi require high-fidelity, time-sensitive data but historically there has been no way to access such data on-chain as it is typically kept behind the \u201Cwalled gardens\u2019\u2019 of centralized institutions. Pyth solves that problem by bringing real-world data on-chain in a tamper-proof environment.","\u201CJoining the Pyth network was an obvious decision for us as we share a common goal to make markets more accessible and transparent for trading participants through blockchain technology and decentralized finance,\u201D said Michael Wu, Chief Executive Officer of Amber. \u201CThe Pyth network is one of the most exciting and promising projects that we\u2019ve seen hit the ecosystem and we look forward to providing our crypto data to help it flourish.\u201D","Amber Group is a leading global crypto finance service provider servicing over 500 institutional clients and has cumulatively traded over $500 billion across 100+ electronic exchanges, with over $1.5 billion in assets under management.
