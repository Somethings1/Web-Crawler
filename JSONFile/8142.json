The firm argues Ghys neither confirmed that the option would not be exercised nor had the authority to do so. &nbsp;","\u201CIf Bitstamp was valued at a billion dollars, Holdings\u2019 call option under the Side Letter would entitle it to purchase Mr Kodrič\u2019s shares at a discount of tens of millions of dollars to their market value. This made it even less plausible that Holdings would give those rights up informally and without further discussion,\u201D stated NXMH in its filing.","NXMH tried to exercise its call option on July 21, a move that would have seen it claim Kodrič\u2019s remaining shares in Bitstamp for $13.46 million \u2014 a price he claims is \u201Cvery significantly lower\u201D than their value.","In a counterclaim, NXMH is seeking either to force through either the transfer of the shares from Kodrič\u2019s family office or claim damages equal to their value.","Kodrič\u2019s lawsuit in August revealed Bitstamp\u2019s ambition to pursue an IPO, but also details of how he was replaced as CEO by former Gemini executive Julian Sawyer.","Part of Kodrič\u2019s claim is that he was told by NXMH\u2019s representatives that his involvement was crucial to any IPO drive, but the investment firm has denied this.","\u201CIt is denied that NXMH and Holdings regarded Mr Kodrič\u2019s involvement as a shareholder or director to be critical or necessary. The value of Mr Kodrič\u2019s involvement in any capacity was dependent on whether he remained focused and committed to Bitstamp,\u201D stated NXMH in its defense.","© 2023 The Block.
