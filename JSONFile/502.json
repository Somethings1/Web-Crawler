However, the rules themselves are more or less the same as those that apply to other financial institutions in the UK, so many of us did see this coming,\" he added.","Linch is a former Shearman &amp; Sterling solicitor with more than a decade of experience deciphering and drafting regulatory policy \u2014 particularly in financial regulation. He is also the former General Counsel and current CEO of Bittrex Global, which announced it was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263875\/bittrex-global-to-wind-down-operations-urges-customers-to-withdraw-funds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">winding down<\/a> in November amid the crypto exchange\u2019s own regulatory troubles and falling market share.","\u201CKeeping consumers safe is of paramount importance, and the best way to do that is by forming a legal framework that is comprehensible enough for the market to remain compliant with, and explicit enough for the regulator, in this case, the FCA, to enforce,\u201D Linch said.","The UK\u2019s new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233554\/fca-to-roll-out-stricter-rules-for-crypto-ads-including-referral-bonus-ban\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto advertising rules<\/a>, regulated by the FCA, came into effect on Oct. 8 last year \u2014 causing complications for some crypto firms. The new rules, which include a cooling-off period for first-time investors, were rolled out in the hope it would make the marketing of crypto products more transparent and accurate but several firms have found them challenging, while others turned to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255431\/coinbase-okx-and-binance-partner-with-uk-firms-as-regulations-come-into-force\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">third parties<\/a> for compliance.","Fintech firm Revolut <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268168\/revolut-will-suspend-trading-for-uk-business-customers-report\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suspended<\/a> crypto trading for UK businesses earlier this month to \u201Cgive it more time to adjust to new requirements set by the Financial Conduct Authority in October.\u201D Payments giant PayPal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2023\/08\/16\/paypal-to-stop-crypto-purchases-in-uk-until-2024\/#:~:text=Payments%20giant%20PayPal%20will%20temporarily,by%20the%20country's%20financial%20regulator.\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> last year it would temporarily pause crypto purchases in the UK until early 2024, and crypto exchange Bybit exited the UK in October amid the rule change.","Bybit was not the only crypto exchange impacted, with other major platforms, including OKX and Binance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255431\/coinbase-okx-and-binance-partner-with-uk-firms-as-regulations-come-into-force\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reevaluating<\/a> their strategies in light of the FCA's strict guidelines, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou told The Block at the time. The new rules could mean that just having a website accessible to UK customers could be construed as a promotion, Zhou said. The FCA previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/240231\/fca-crypto-memes-breach-financial-promotion-rules\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">warned<\/a> that even crypto memes could breach the financial promotion rules.","\u201CWe have engaged extensively with the cryptoasset industry in the UK and overseas to help firms prepare for the new financial promotions rules,\u201D an FCA spokesperson told The Block. \u201CWe also offered cryptoasset firms an additional three months to implement parts of the rules that required greater technical development and published detailed guidance to help firms understand our expectations.\u201D","\u201CWe will continue to work with the cryptoasset industry as it implements our financial promotion rules,\u201D the FCA spokesperson added.","Some progress has been made on the regulatory front. In October, the UK Treasury <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/260020\/uk-treasury-releases-final-proposals-for-crypto-asset-regulation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">publishing<\/a> its final proposals for future regulation of crypto, outlining the government's intention to bring crypto asset activities into the regulatory perimeter of financial services for the first time.","In December, the UK <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268212\/uk-introduces-new-regulations-for-its-digital-securities-sandbox\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">introduced<\/a> new regulations for supervising the nation\u2019s Digital Securities Sandbox, which came into force on Jan. 8 \u2014 aiming to facilitate the adoption of digital assets across financial markets with oversight from The Bank of England and FCA.","\u201CThe Digital Securities Sandbox is a really positive initiative and a good example of the UK taking ownership of its crypto ambitions,\u201D Linch said. \u201CSo long as potential market participants engage enthusiastically with the programme, then the adoption of crypto will continue to rise.\u201D","However, unless this can lead to a comprehensive legal framework, and with the UK\u2019s general election around the corner, Sunak\u2019s ambition of creating a global web3 hub in the UK may be put on hold.","\u201CThe next step is taking the learnings from the Sandbox \u2014 direct from the industry \u2014 and implementing them into a comprehensive legal framework so that regulated crypto activity can exist outside of that bubble and propel the UK forward,\u201D Linch said. \u201CThe Digital Securities Sandbox will help but only legislation will suffice.\u201D","\u201CLegislation has been lacking for some time and is well overdue,\u201D Linch continued. \u201CWithout it, the UK won\u2019t match its ambitions of becoming a global crypto hub and will fall further down the pecking order to MENA, APAC and the EU.\u201D","Linch said that there needs to be more coordination between the government and its financial regulator as there is currently a degree of polarity.","\u201CThat is hardly an enticing environment for some of the world\u2019s largest crypto players to consider \u2014 particularly if the UK wants to attract global firms away from the EU,\" he continued. \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227309\/mica-european-union-crypto-regulation-passes\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MiCA<\/a> has certainly given the EU first-mover advantage, but the UK boasts the enormously successful City of London with all its existing infrastructure, a strong talent pool and the many advantages of a common law system. Deployed properly, these could present a real challenge to the EU, even with its passporting regime and single market, so&nbsp;it\u2019s really up to the government to capitalise on that, and do what is necessary to make that possible.\u201D","However, that might be a tall order for the current government as time is also running out ahead of an election expected in the latter half of this year, possibly in mid-November. Sunak\u2019s Conservative party is significantly behind in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.eu\/europe-poll-of-polls\/united-kingdom\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">polls<\/a>, and \u201Ccrypto won\u2019t be quite as high on the priority list for a Labour government as it should be,\u201D Linch said.&nbsp;","\u201CThe Prime Minister and his Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Bim Afolami, have at best 10 months to get to where the EU has with MiCA and introduce a substantive regulatory framework for crypto,\u201D he added. \u201CThat is a big ask, but it\u2019s certainly achievable in that timeframe.\u201D","The Block reached out to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s office for comment.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with additional clarifications from Oliver Linch and comment from the FCA.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["FCA","UK PARLIAMENT"]}
