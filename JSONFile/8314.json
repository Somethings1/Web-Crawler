Former FTX executive Ryan Salame pleaded guilty to two counts related to his conduct at FTX as former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky\u2019s home and assets were ordered frozen. Meanwhile, the Lazarus group got away with a $41 million dollar heist, while a different crypto investor lost $24 million to a phishing attack. Also, why is Texas paying bitcoin miners not to mine bitcoin? And is a regulation-friendly alternative to Tornado Cash possible?&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Let\u2019s take a closer look at each story in this recap.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The FBI has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/249805\/fbi-says-north-korea-linked-lazarus-group-was-responsible-for-41-million-theft-on-stake\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">attributed<\/span><\/a> a recent theft of $41 million from the crypto sports betting platform Stake.com to the North Korea-affiliated Lazarus Group. This incident on September 4 is one of several high-profile heists orchestrated by the group, with its thefts totaling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241607\/lazarus-group-suspected-by-coinspaid-of-37-million-hack\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">over $200 million<\/span><\/a> this year. The Blockchain Association's director Ron Hammond highlighted the escalating concern surrounding such attacks, which have prompted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/240587\/senate-bill-would-tighten-money-laundering-and-sanctions-rules-for-defi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">legislation<\/span><\/a> like the Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement and Enforcement Act (CANSEE).

Security firms believe the individual was <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0xbb4fe89c03d8321c5bfed612fb76f0756ac7e99c1efaf7c4d99d99f850d4de53\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">deceived<\/span><\/a> into authorizing malicious transactions through a phishing link.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Former FTX executive Ryan Salame <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/249844\/former-ftx-exec-ryan-salame-to-surrender-assets-including-porsche-after-guilty-plea\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pleaded guilty<\/span><\/a> in a New York federal court to charges of conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. Released on a $1 million bond, Salame admitted to making $10 million in political contributions under the guise of loans. He also agreed to surrender $1.6 billion in assets and forfeit two properties and a Porsche.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Salame is the fourth individual to plead guilty in relation to the crypto exchange FTX's collapse. He, along with co-conspirators, made over 300 illegal political donations, often using straw donors, according to prosecutors. Previously, Salame was investigated for potential campaign finance violations related to his girlfriend Michelle Bond's 2022 congressional race. Despite his guilty plea, Salame <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/249844\/former-ftx-exec-ryan-salame-to-surrender-assets-including-porsche-after-guilty-plea\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">does not intend to testify<\/span><\/a> at the upcoming criminal trial of former FTX CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The assets and property of former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/249474\/former-celsius-ceo-mashinskys-home-and-assets-ordered-frozen-in-criminal-case\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">frozen<\/span><\/a> following an order from The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, under Judge Jed Rakoff. This order encompasses funds at Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and SoFi Bank, as well as a residence in Austin, Texas.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mashinsky's arrest in July stemmed from allegations that he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239432\/celsius-and-alex-mashinsky-face-slew-of-criminal-regulatory-allegations\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">defrauded<\/span><\/a> customers and misrepresented the profitability of Celsius. The company, which declared bankruptcy last year, is under scrutiny from various regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused Celsius and Mashinsky of fraudulently raising funds and misleading investors about the company's financial health. Both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have also filed lawsuits against Mashinsky. Despite these charges, Mashinsky, who posted a $40 million bond in July, maintains his innocence.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In August, two prominent <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -0.087%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> mining companies, Riot Platforms and Iris Energy, received substantial energy credits from the state of Texas for voluntarily reducing their power consumption during peak demand periods.
