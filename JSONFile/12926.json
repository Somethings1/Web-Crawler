Individual transactions that used to cost in the cents now routinely cost tens or hundreds of dollars. Users paid ~$10 billion in aggregate transaction fees on the Ethereum network in 2021.&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">General-purpose scaling technologies are needed - badly.<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Alternative layer-1 platforms, sidechains, and layer-2 networks are all taking different approaches to increase blockchain scalability with different tradeoffs. This report focuses on layer-2 rollups which aim to bring scaling gains while inheriting Ethereum\u2019s base layer security to the maximum extent.&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Layer-2 rollups are at an inflection point in terms of adoption. <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Many rollup networks were deployed in production environments in just the past few months. They still have relatively low levels of adoption compared to alternative layer-1 networks and sidechains. But several data series in this report highlight signs of early product market fit.&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Layer-2 scaling solutions are surrounded by technical jargon. <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This report introduces a simple analysis framework for comparing and contrasting them. It evaluates six different layer-2 networks in depth and profiles their related organizations, outlines how they are technically designed, analyzes their on-chain and ecosystem data, and identifies challenges and catalysts for their adoption.&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Layer-2 development organizations are well positioned to bolster ecosystem growth.<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Nearly $1.3 billion of venture capital has poured into these organizations in the last ~18 months. Development organizations have ample funding to invest in their core protocol technology and incentivize developer and user adoption.<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Layer-2 incentive programs appear to be on the way.<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> There is wide-ranging consensus that many layer-2 networks will launch native tokens. However, it remains unclear when they will do so. This report briefly examines the use cases of layer-2 tokens that are currently in circulation and identifies several factors that make the launch of additional layer-2 native tokens likely.<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Note: Shortly prior to the publication of this report, Optimism announced plans to launch a native token (OP) through a retroactive airdrop - the details of which are not included in the report.
