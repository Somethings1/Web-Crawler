A minority, 33%, voted against the vote, highlighting a disagreement within the community regarding the use of treasury funds for staking incentives.&nbsp;","After this temperature check voting period, the DAO is set to consider a subsequent AIP proposal that will focus on the specifics of the staking implementation and will need approval. Furthermore, a final community nod on the Tally, an on-chain DAO management platform, would be required to finally grant stakers a token yield from the treasury. This yield will be distinct from other mechanisms where tokens are staked to secure the network or to distribute revenue.","The annualized percentage yield is estimated between 7.84% and 78.43% if 100 million tokens are used, depending on the percentage of the ARB supply that is staked.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The headline and body were updated to clarify that a final vote will be conducted before the staking implementation.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
