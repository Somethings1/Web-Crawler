Zhao confirmed those details in an interview with The Block. The exact size of the round is yet to be determined, as discussions with investors are ongoing.","\u201CWe are helping all the creators and influencers who are completely web2 to get into web3 by giving them a very simple user interface,\u201D she said. \u201CThey can actually use their Apple Wallet, any wallet they have, to buy anything on our platform.\u201D","Zhao, an Instagram model and entrepreneur, demonstrated how NFTs might be used to monetise a social media following earlier this year, when she dropped <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/irenedao\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a collection<\/a> named IreneDAO. Some 2,600 ether (roughly $6.5 million) of the digital stickers \u2014 depicting Zhao in various poses accompanied by crypto catchphrases \u2014 have changed hands on OpenSea.","Zhao described the IreneDAO project as a proof of concept for the SO-COL platform.","Founded by Zhao and co-founder Benjamin Tang, SO-COL closed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/animoca-brands-coleads-175m-seed-startup-irenedao\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">its $1.75 million seed round<\/a> as recently as February this year. Animoca Brands and DeFiance Capital co-led that raise, alongside Three Arrows Capital, Mechanism Capital, Global Founders Capital, Double Peak Group, Antifund, Genblock Capital, and Kronos Research.","Zhao describes SO-COL as a \u2018web2.5\u2019 play \u2014 bridging the gap between crypto natives and internet users who are as yet unfamiliar with tools like NFTs. The company is working with Stripe to offer traditional payment methods for fans, and with StarkEx, the Ethereum scaling platform, to try to trim creator fees, she added.","SO-COL is yet to officially launch, but Zhao sees that changing within the next month. Proceeds from the raise will be used for hiring developers, to continue building the app, and for marketing.","Zhao has already recruited celebrities to help with a promotional push but declined to name them. One partnership involves a Michelin star chef who will use SO-COL to roll out NFTs that grant holders exclusive memberships at their restaurants.","SO-COL will assist creators with a wide variety of NFT-based projects, providing both technology and consulting services.","Sterling Campbell of Blockchain Capital said in a statement that he sees web3 technologies like SO-COL allowing influencers \u201Cto token-gate deeper access, exclusive merch, masterclasses, and more.\u201D","\u201CThe willingness to pay for deeper engagement is higher than the value that many web2 platforms provide, and web3 brings that engagement directly to the fan,\u201D he continued.","Â© 2023 The Block.
