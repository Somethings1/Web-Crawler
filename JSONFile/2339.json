Mintable's current headcount is 14, and Burks is looking to increase it to 35 by the end of this year.","As for user acquisition initiatives, Burks said Mintable's goal is to reach the mass market \u2014 beyond just crypto users \u2014 by simplifying the purchase experience of NFTs. \"We consider ourselves an e-commerce platform first and an NFT platform second,\" said Burks.","Mintable is built on Ethereum and also supports the Zilliqa blockchain. The platform offers a \"gas-free\" minting feature, meaning users can create NFTs on Ethereum without paying transaction fees. Burks called this <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.mintable.app\/ethereum-version\/basics\/types-of-items-gasless-printable-normal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">gasless minting<\/a> \"game-changing technology\" because it is not on a Layer 2 blockchain or a side chain, and is not minted at a later date. It works by using blockchain signatures to create the NFT until it is first moved.","Founded in 2018, Mintable says it has helped create around 700,000 NFTs on its platform, to date. These NFTs have fetched an average price in the range of $10,000-$50,000, said Burks. A few NFTs have been sold for $500,000, and one NFT exchanged hands for $2 million.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/nft-overview\/average-price-of-an-nft-sale\/embed\" title=\"Average Price of an NFT Sale (7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","The Series A brings Mintable's total funding to date to $15.5 million. The platform has previously raised $2.5 million in seed funding from investors including Mark Cuban, Ashton Kutcher's Sound Ventures, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's TIME Ventures, said Burks.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/108313\/mark-cuban-defi-could-be-the-next-great-growth-engine-for-the-us\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cuban<\/a> appears to be betting big on NFTs.
