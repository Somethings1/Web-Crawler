Here\u2019s how to get your crypto taxes done by April 18 with the least amount of friction possible.&nbsp;<\/span><\/i>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Let\u2019s just cut to the chase. The IRS has been really clear that cryptocurrency is definitely taxed - and that they\u2019re able to track crypto investments through various channels.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In brief, crypto is subject to Capital Gains Tax and sometimes Income Tax. You\u2019ll pay long-term Capital Gains Tax between 0% to 20% or you\u2019ll pay short-term Capital Gains Tax or Income Tax between 10% to 37%, depending on your Income Tax bracket.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With that out of the way, let\u2019s look at the steps you need to take to report your crypto in your tax return by April 18.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Getting your complete crypto transaction history if you're an active investor using multiple wallets, exchanges and blockchains is no easy feat. To do this manually, you'd need to download CSV files of your transaction history from every exchange, wallet or blockchain you use. Then you'd need to identify your transfers from your taxable transactions, identify which kind of tax you'd need to apply for each taxable transaction and calculate your subsequent capital gains or losses, as well as the fair market value of any crypto income. Quite a mouthful!<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fortunately, aggregating your transaction history with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/koinly.io\/?utm_source=theblockcrypto.com&amp;utm_medium=guestpost\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Koinly<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is simple. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Koinly has been supporting crypto investors with a fully IRS-compliant tax reporting system since day 1, so if you\u2019re looking for a solution right now - it can be as simple as jumping onto Koinly and connecting all your wallets, exchanges and blockchains. Koinly supports more than 650 exchanges, wallets and blockchains - all you need to do is connect via API or by importing a CSV file of your transaction history. Let\u2019s take a look at how.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Koinly supports all the major crypto exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Kraken and KuCoin. To automatically get your transaction data, you can use the API. Just head into your exchange and create a read-only API key - you\u2019ll normally find this under API management or settings. Once you\u2019ve created your key, copy your API key and API secret and head over to Koinly. Select the exchange you want to add, then the set up auto-sync option&nbsp; and enter your API details and your transaction data with that exchange will be automatically imported into Koinly.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If you\u2019d rather use CSV to import your transaction data - no worries, you can do that with Koinly too. Just download a CSV file of your transaction data from your exchange. This needs to be your complete transaction history - for however long you\u2019ve used that exchange for - so you may need multiple CSV files. Once you\u2019ve got your complete transaction history, select the exchange you want to add in Koinly, then the import from file option and upload your CSV file(s). Koinly will then go through your CSV file data and calculate your crypto taxes.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If you\u2019re using non-custodial wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Exodus or Yoroi, Koinly supports these too. In most instances, Koinly supports these wallets via API. All you need to do is go into your wallet and find the public address. If you\u2019re using a wallet to interact with multiple blockchains, you\u2019ll need to grab the public address for each blockchain you interact with using that wallet. For example, if you were using Trust Wallet to interact with the BNB, ETH and BTC - you'd need your public address for each. Once you\u2019ve got your public address, head over to Koinly, select the wallet you want to add, then set up auto-sync and then enter your public address. Again, if you\u2019d rather use CSV file(s), you can often download these from your wallet and upload them to Koinly instead.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For blockchains like BTC, ETH, AVAX, ADA and many more - you can connect to Koinly using your public address or key. The steps are similar to above. Just head into the wallet (or wallets) you use to interact with your blockchain and grab your public address. Then head over to Koinly, select add a new wallet, find your blockchain and enter your public address. Koinly will then fetch your transaction history - straight from the blockchain.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If you ever get stuck on how to connect Koinly with a specific exchange, wallet or blockchain - don\u2019t panic, Koinly has done the digging for you. Our integration pages feature step by step guides on how to get connected with Koinly.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Once you\u2019ve got all your exchanges, wallets and blockchains connected with Koinly - Koinly does the hard work of converting all your crypto into the fiat currency value for you. This saves you hours of crawling through historical crypto price data on price aggregator sites.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Koinly sets the market price for your transaction in a couple of different ways. First, it'll try to determine the market price using data available from your transaction history. For example, if you bought ETH using USD on a given day, Koinly will set this as the market price.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If you bought crypto using a different fiat currency to your base currency in Koinly, Koinly will use Forex rates for the day of your transaction to identify the market price.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Finally, for transactions that don't involve any fiat currency - like income or crypto to crypto trades - Koinly uses market price aggregators like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko to identify the market price for your crypto. Koinly may also fetch market rates directly from certain exchanges if you've used the API integration method.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Now you\u2019ve got everything in dollars - you can move onto calculating your crypto taxes.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Capital what now? If you\u2019re new to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/koinly.io\/cryptocurrency-taxes\/?utm_source=theblockcrypto.com&amp;utm_medium=guestpost\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto tax<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> - it\u2019s confusing, but Koinly can help by identifying your taxable transactions from your non-taxable transactions, calculating your capital gains and losses, as well as any crypto income for you.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For capital gains - Koinly will identify each time you\u2019ve sold, traded or spent crypto and calculate your subsequent capital gain or loss for you. It even separates out your short-term capital gains from your long-term capital gains in your report, so you can rest easy knowing you\u2019re not paying too much.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For income like mining, staking rewards and interest - Koinly identifies the fair market value of any crypto income in USD on the day you received it. This is separated out in your crypto tax report, and even broken down into the different types of income if you need to report each separately.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DeFi is a particular challenge for investors when the tax season rolls around, but not with Koinly. Koinly supports a wide range of popular web wallets used to interact with DeFi protocols - so whether you\u2019re providing liquidity on Uniswap or staking CAKE on PancakeSwap - Koinly can handle it. Koinly is evolving just as quickly as the DeFi market, so we\u2019re always adding support for new tokens and protocols.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With your crypto taxes calculated, there\u2019s one thing left to do\u2026 bring it all together in an IRS-compliant report.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However you prefer to file, Koinly has the report you need. There are three main ways to file, so let\u2019s take a quick look at each.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Filing yourself<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Though it\u2019s probably too late to file with paper forms unless you have an extension - we\u2019ll cover it anyway.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">You\u2019ll need to report each disposal of crypto (any time you sold, traded or spent crypto) on Form 8949, as well as your net capital gain and loss on Schedule D. Koinly has this exact form, available to download, pre-filled with your transactions.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">You\u2019ll also need to report your crypto income on Schedule 1, generally under the \u2018other income\u2019 section - although if you\u2019re self-employed this would go on Schedule C instead. Koinly can help with this too, download either the Complete Tax Report or Income Tax Report which will include all your crypto income totals in USD, ready to add to your forms.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Once you\u2019ve completed your additional forms, fill out your Form 1040 and attach your Schedule D, Form 8949 and Schedule 1 (or C) and you\u2019re done!<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Filing with an accountant<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Got an accountant last minute? Koinly makes their job much easier!<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">You can give your accountant access to Koinly. Just log into your Koinly account, go to settings, then team and invite your accountant, CPA or tax agent. They can then view your Koinly account and do your crypto taxes for you.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Filing with a tax app<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Filing with a tax app like TurboTax or TaxAct? Koinly can generate specific reports for these tax apps too.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For TurboTax, just download the TurboTax Online or Desktop Report from Koinly (depending on the version of TurboTax you\u2019re using) and then upload this to TurboTax when you\u2019re filing your investments and savings.&nbsp; If you\u2019ve got income, add the total income figure from your Koinly Complete Tax Report (or Income Tax Report) as miscellaneous income. Done!<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For TaxAct,&nbsp; you'll download your Form 8949 and Schedule D from Koinly (as well as your Complete Tax Report or Income Tax Report if you have any crypto income). You can upload this to TaxAct when filing your capital gains, and you can report any crypto income as other income in TaxAct.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">And that\u2019s it!
