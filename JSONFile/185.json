Since then, the project has met considerable resistance from politicians and regulators.&nbsp;","Schulman pushed back on the theory that PayPal withdrew due to fear of compliance issues.","\u201CWe have an extremely robust relationship with every regulator out there,\u201D he told Fortune. \u201CThat wasn\u2019t really what spooked us on it. It was just about, 'Where do we want to put our attention, and what do we want to do today to advance our mission?'\u201D","Schulman also said that PayPal did not anticipate the amount of work left to be done with Libra and did not want Libra to consume all its resources. \u201CWe think if we focus on our own roadmap, we\u2019d be able to advance financial inclusion faster than if we put all these resources against Libra,\u201D he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;","However, firms like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard have reasons to be particularly concerned with hostility from regulators. Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) wrote a strongly-worded <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/19272614\/Signed_Letters_re_Libra_to_Patrick_Collison__Ajaypal_Banga__and_Alfred_Kelly.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter<\/a> to the CEOs of Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe, suggesting that companies involved with the project would face a higher level of regulatory oversight. The letter highlights the risk associated with the Libra Project when it comes to potentially facilitating criminal and terrorist financing.","Now that all major card processors have dropped out of the Libra Association, the challenge of navigating through compliance issues might be greater.&nbsp;","\u201CWe believe Libra will fail without the involvement of the major payments players,\u201D analysts at Moffett Nathanson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency-loses-support-of-five-founding-members\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told<\/a> CNET. \u201CThey bring essential, deep payments expertise, trusted payments brands, global acceptance and settlement networks, and relationships with every major financial institution, government, and regulatory body around the world.\u201D","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Future plan?<\/strong>","PayPal\u2019s CFO John Rainey <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/why-bitcoin-isnt-a-big-focus-yet-at-pay-pal-152241593.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> in May that they \u201Chave teams working on blockchain and cryptocurrency,\u201D although they were not sold on the idea that Bitcoin is the future of payments.","Despite owning bitcoins himself, Schulman remains suspicious about cryptocurrency due to its volatile nature. Merchants operate on small margins, he explained, so they have to immediately turn their crypto assets into fiat, which adds to the cost. &nbsp;","\u201CUntil it becomes less volatile, it won\u2019t be a currency that is widely accepted by merchants on the web \u2014 not the dark web, but the web,\u201D he said.","Schulman reaffirmed to Fortune that PayPal is experimenting with its own blockchain and cryptocurrency projects, which he claimed are \u201Cnot necessarily competitive with Libra,\u201D although he refused to give out details regarding the company\u2019s next product or acquisition. &nbsp;","\u201CMost people think that blockchain is about efficiency, but the system today is pretty efficient,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s intriguing to us, but it really needs to do something that the traditional rails can\u2019t do.\u201D"],"hashtag":[]}
