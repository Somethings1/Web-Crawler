To someone that is new to crypto, these headlines might seem appropriate. However, if you\u2019ve been around the industry for more than a few years, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/ledn.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">like us at Ledn<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, these headlines should come as no surprise.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Mainstream journalists are always waiting on opportunities to dunk on Bitcoin and the crypto industry, at times going so far as to proclaim Bitcoin as dead.","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin is not dead. In fact, it is more alive than it ever has been. The number of network addresses showing balances above 0.01 is at its highest point ever, north of 11 million. This is occurring amidst the largest market shock the industry has ever sustained.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The FTX fallout resembles previous fraud cases. Elizabeth Holmes, Bernie Madoff, and Enron are all cases that come to mind. These cases are evidence that fraud can occur anywhere: from healthcare, to financial services, energy companies and even government. This, however, does not mean that the industry or sector itself is fraudulent. It means that there\u2019s a bad actor in an otherwise good industry. The FTX story will be no different and the mainstream media would do well to remember that.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Having said all of this, there is no doubt that the crypto industry will take some time to recover. Many enthusiasts just suffered significant losses, and their excitement (and portfolios) have been shattered. It will be up to the remaining players to rebuild trust with their clients. To do so, even more transparency will be required. Clients will rightfully demand more risk disclosures from all service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lenders, in particular, will tighten their covenants to minimize any future risks.
