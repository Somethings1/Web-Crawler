A similar examiner was appointed in the ongoing bankruptcy process of failed crypto lender Celsius, leading to the filing of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207079\/highlights-from-the-court-report-detailing-celsius-ponzi-like-downfall\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bombshell report<\/a> on the company's demise in that company's ongoing bankruptcy process.&nbsp;","Caretaker leadership and lawyers for the corporate family reported approximately $1.4 billion in remaining assets in court yesterday.
