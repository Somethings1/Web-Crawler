The network aims to leverage ZK-Rollup technology for compatibility with Ethereum apps while operating separately from Immutable's existing StarkEx-based Layer 2 chain, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/101092\/ethereum-startup-immutable-aims-to-cut-nft-costs-with-new-layer-2-scaling-protocol\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Immutable X<\/a>.<\/span>","A zkEVM, or zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, is a Layer 2 scaling solution that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to enable faster and more efficient transactions on the Ethereum network. It's designed to work in conjunction with Ethereum's mainnet, providing a secure and scalable off-chain solution for processing transactions and executing smart contracts.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Immutable X currently provides fast and cheap transactions for gaming apps, but lacks native compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain. Its new network, Immutable zkEVM, will offer compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing developers to use established Ethereum tools to build smart contracts with a focus on gaming applications. This blockchain is expected to go live within the second quarter of 2023.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the future, Immutable zkEVM will be secured by validators who stake Matic, the native token of Polygon's sidechain network, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sandeepnailwal\/status\/1637934819798843392\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.

Over the past year, several blockchain projects, including Polygon, Starknet, zkSync, and Scroll, have been competing to develop a functional ZK-based Layer 2 solution capable of natively supporting Ethereum apps.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
