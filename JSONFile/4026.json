FTX\u2019s general counsel, Ryne Miller, and FTX US\u2019 head of policy and regulatory strategy, Mark Wetjen, joined Bankman-Fried in the meeting with two of SEC Chair Gary Gensler\u2019s senior staffers. Gensler himself met virtually for 30 minutes with Bankman-Fried and the FTX executives on March 29, according to his public calendar.&nbsp;","The executives and SEC staff discussed \u201Ccustody of digital asset securities by special purpose broker-dealers, including the unique risks associated with custody of digital asset securities,\u201D in addition to the discussion about the possibility of a no-action letter, the meeting notes show. In 2019 the agency issued guidance around digital assets for broker-dealers, and that guidance was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/policy\/2020\/34-90788.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">amended<\/a> in 2021.&nbsp;","Wetjen did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment. Senior staff for stock exchange IEX, including co-founder and CEO Brad Katsuyama, were also present for the meeting. FTX announced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/ftx-us-and-iex-join-forces-to-help-shape-market-structure-for-digital-assets-301517550.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an investment in IEX<\/a> on April 5.&nbsp;","\"We engaged with [the SEC] to better understand their view of the regulatory paradigm that should apply to the digital asset securities space,\" an IEX spokesperson said. \"At no time have we sought, nor did the SEC ever suggest that any entity could or should be given, special treatment.\u201D","\"Because the topic came up in the meeting, a memo was added to the comment file,\u201D an SEC spokesperson told The Block while confirming that the request was not granted.","In 2019 the agency <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/divisions\/corpfin\/cf-noaction\/2019\/turnkey-jet-040219-2a1.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">granted a no-action request<\/a> to TurnKey Jet, a private jet company over the ICO of a utility token for chartering private flights. The grant from the SEC was on the condition that TurnKey Jet possess a fully developed network and app for the token before its sale, and that any funds raised from the token could be usable on day one of issuance.","The SEC in 2020 issued a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/divisions\/marketreg\/mr-noaction\/2020\/finra-ats-role-in-settlement-of-digital-asset-security-trades-09252020.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">broader no-action letter for broker-dealers<\/a> operating trading systems for digital assets, laying out conditions where staff would not recommend an enforcement action.&nbsp;","Still, the FTX meeting attracted the attention of online crypto advocates and SEC critics.","In a Nov. 10 tweet, Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., charged Gensler with working with Bankman-Fried and FTX on&nbsp; \u201Clegal loopholes to obtain a regulatory monopoly.\u201D His colleague on the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, also criticized the SEC's \"selective enforcement.\u201D","Tyler Gellasch, the head of pro-financial regulations nonprofit Healthy Markets and a one-time aide to former SEC Commissioner Kara Stein, downplayed the meeting.","\u201CNothing about somebody coming in and asking for a no-action letter is unusual,\u201D he said. \u201CWhat\u2019s unusual is that someone from the digital asset industry came in and met with the SEC as opposed to their more favored regulator, the CFTC.\u201D","Gensler has voiced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185024\/current-crypto-legislation-undermines-the-sec-gensler-says\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reservations<\/a> over legislation Bankman-Fried supported that would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more power over digital asset rulemaking and oversight. Decentralized finance advocates are suspicious of the bill as favoring current centralized exchanges.
