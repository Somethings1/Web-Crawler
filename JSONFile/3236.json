He called the updates \u201Cpainful, but necessary\u201D in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1596053664338440192\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweet<\/a>.","Twitter has undergone profound changes since Musk took the helm of the company, laying off thousands of employees and reinstating formerly banned accounts.","Blue checks were previously reserved for celebrities and public figures, then on Nov. 9 Musk opened up the option to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/181862\/musk-to-offer-twitter-account-verification-as-a-subscription-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">obtain one<\/a> to anyone willing to pay $8 a month.","Reception to the change was mixed and critics raised concerns that it would increase scams. With anyone able to purchase one, users were able to make accounts impersonating people like former U.S. President George W. Bush and basketball star LeBron James, with an extra veneer of believability due to their blue check status.&nbsp;","The system was later paused, with Musk saying it wouldn\u2019t reopen until there was \u201Chigh confidence of stopping impersonation.\u201D","The team at Twitter is working on restarting it, tentatively next week. Some changes have already been introduced, including new accounts having to wait 90 days from creation to buy a Twitter Blue subscription.","More details will be released next week, according to Musk.","Â© 2023 The Block.
