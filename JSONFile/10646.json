In&nbsp; 2010, Manning, then a soldier in the US Army, used<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/julian-assange-chelsea-manning-intertwined\/story?id=62344376\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> encrypted communication services to disclose classified information<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to Julian Assange, which was later posted on WikiLeaks.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Now, she\u2019s a part of privacy blockchain startup Nym as both a security analyst and serving in a hardware optimization role.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Switzerland-based Nym is a decentralized network that uses blockchain technology to mix and scramble packets of metadata \u2014&nbsp;e.g. your IP address, who you talk to, and when and where.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During the interview, Manning speaks to The Block over a video call from Brussels, where last week she opened the 2022 Computers, Privacy and Data Protection Conference with Nym CEO Harry Halpin and famed cryptographer Bart Preneel.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite a childhood interest in cryptography, Manning says she shied away from the cryptocurrency scene for much of the 2010s due to what she sees as a toxic focus on speculation that has taken precedence over the sector\u2019s potential to upend online surveillance.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For Manning, it wasn\u2019t the floor price of the latest buzzy NFT collection but blockchain\u2019s potential to make the internet a safer place that drew her to the sector. \u201CMy primary interest [in joining the crypto sector] from the get-go has always been the privacy aspect,\u201D she says.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Manning sees Nym as the successor to privacy tech such as the Tor browser and VPNs. Tor, however, has been used both as a way for people in unstable countries to access information and by bad actors looking to access dark web marketplaces such as The Silk Road. Nym says that there are disincentives put in place to stop such abuse via the validation and verification of actors running the nodes on the network.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">And while blockchain technology is often associated with transparency as opposed to privacy, Nym says it is only the nodes of the so-called mixnet that are ledger-based \u2014 and none of the data itself is stored on the ledger.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Manning and her colleagues at Nym hope that its mixnet can act as the infrastructure upon which applications can be built to create a privacy-focused internet.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By doing this, they hope to foster an alternative to surveillance capitalism \u2013 a term coined by academic Shoshana Zuboff to describe the tracking and commodification of personal data shared online for profit by big tech.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe moment you share something personal with the world on social media, it\u2019s grabbed without your knowledge and used in algorithms to target not only you but also the people around you,\u201D says Nym chief strategy officer Jaya Brekke.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For marginalized communities, a private internet is of particular importance, says Manning. She notes that while trans and queer communities have become increasingly visible over the last few years, this has also resulted in increased pressure and instances of harassment driving people into anonymized roles and spaces.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CFor the safety of the community, I think that having access to the option of private technologies in a time where we are so visible is vital and important \u2014 literally every vulnerable person in the entire world can benefit from these technologies, \u201D says Manning.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Manning disagreed with the notion that the lack of privacy online has become so normalized that the everyday user is apathetic towards data protection. She cites the adoption of Signal, an encrypted messaging service, as an example of the everyday user prioritizing privacy. \u201CI actually think that people do care. They\u2019ve just given up because there is no alternative,\u201D she says.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A who\u2019s who of venture capitalists seems to think she\u2019s right.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In early May, the Nym project brought in outside backers including Polychain Capital and a16z for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/144344\/privacy-startup-nym-brings-in-outside-backers-for-developer-fund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a $300 million developer fund<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to sponsor such projects. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/19\/nym-raises-13m-from-a16zs-crypto-fund\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nym raised a $13 million Series A<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> led by a16z last November.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhat I find particularly interesting about the fact that there is VC backing for this project is that other projects that are purely nonprofit don\u2019t have nearly the investment or funding that we do,\u201D she says.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Manning, however, acknowledges that the vast majority of the well-known crypto projects are centralized entities focused on the financial gain of their users and not privacy. These are the blockchain projects that VCs have showered the majority of billions onto thus far, not utility-based projects such as Nym.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s for this reason that she understands why some have been skeptical of her involvement in blockchain technology.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ultimately, however, she hopes she can change this and alter the perception of crypto and blockchain technology. \u201CI do want to shift the culture away from crypto being associated only with cryptocurrency,\u201D she says.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The first step is to develop Nym from a nascent privacy startup into a viable technology that users can interact with daily without having to understand the technologies that underpin it.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Manning says she\u2019s also including an element of how her personal history is tied in with cryptography in an upcoming memoir.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI want to be an evangelist for going back to the cyberpunk roots of crypto,\u201D she says. \u201DThis means making it about cryptographic technology that actually helps people in their communications, in their privacy and in their ability to protect themselves.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
