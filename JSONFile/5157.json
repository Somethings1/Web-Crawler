Wood made the investment after asking Laffer \u2014 who taught her at the University of Southern California \u2014 to look into bitcoin.&nbsp;","\"I've been looking for this ever since we went off the gold standard,\" Laffer told her, before saying bitcoin was a rules-based monetary system. Wood said she asked the economist how big bitcoin could be, to which he responded with a question: \"How big is the U.S. monetary base?\"","Bitcoin's market cap was around $6 billion at the time, and the U.S. monetary base \u2014 the total sum of dollars in circulation as well as reserve balances \u2014 was $4.5 trillion.&nbsp;","Based on today's bitcoin price of about $19,250, Wood has made an unrealized profit of over $7.6 million on her $100,000 investment.&nbsp;","Ark Invest rose to prominence in the 2020 stock market boom as its bets on unprofitable tech companies paid off handsomely and attracted a swell of funds to its exchange traded funds. ETFs are limited to investing in securities, which meant Wood's fund couldn't invest in bitcoin at the time. However, Ark did begin to explore investing in bitcoin through products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and eventually added it to several funds.","Arthur Laffer first rose to prominence in the 1970s when he came up with a tax theory dubbed the Laffer Curve. This said that somewhere between 0% and 100% tax rate there is a maximum tax revenue.","He famously wrote his theory on a napkin during a dinner in Washington, DC, with journalist Jude Wanniski and politicians Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. It was later donated to the National Museum of American History by Wanniski's wife Patricia.","Napkin with sketch of Laffer Curve, on <a href=\"https:\/\/americanhistory.si.edu\/collections\/search\/object\/nmah_1439217\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">display<\/a> at the National Museum of American History.","This theory was used by the Reagan administration to justify cutting taxes in order to increase tax revenue. Many critics argue the curve is over simplistic.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
