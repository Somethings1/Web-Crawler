An index featured in Greenfield\u2019s survey found that 42 protocols with a strong footprint in Europe boasted 1,300 monthly developers collectively in the first quarter, over 300 more than at the end of last year, based on GitHub data. That is the largest quarterly increase since the tracking began in January 2020 \u2014 and it comes despite a punishing year for crypto firms.&nbsp;","Greenfield has raised three funds since 2018.
