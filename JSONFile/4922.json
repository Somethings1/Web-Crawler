But the company insists it doesn\u2019t need money and isn\u2019t actively fundraising.","The blockchain firm has met with multiple investors about fundraising in recent weeks, according to four people familiar with the matter.","Consensys last raised capital in early 2022 in a $450 million Series D round led by ParaFi Capital that valued the startup at $7 billion. Deep-pocketed backers like SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Temasek and Microsoft also participated.","A Consensys spokesperson brushed off the talks, stating that while the startup sometimes considers \u201Cinbound investor interest,\u201D it still has plenty of cash.","\u201CConsensys has been widely perceived as the winner after the debacles of 2022,\u201D the spokesperson said.","\u201CConsequently, the company has experienced a significant influx of inbound investor interest, fueled in part by inaccurate reporting on the secondary market activity in our stock earlier this year,\u201D the spokesperson continued, adding that the company doesn\u2019t need money and is \u201Cnot actively engaged in a formal process.\u201D&nbsp;","Asked about those inaccuracies, the spokesperson clarified that secondary markets represent \u201Ca tiny fraction\u201D of transactions in Consensys stock.&nbsp;","News of the talks comes after a period in which the shares of numerous highly valued, privately held crypto startups \u2014 Consensys among them \u2014 have&nbsp;<a class=\"c-link\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/217937\/opensea-consensys-among-prized-crypto-startups-with-shares-available-at-big-discounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/217937\/opensea-consensys-among-prized-crypto-startups-with-shares-available-at-big-discounts\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">traded at significant discounts<\/a>&nbsp;on secondary market platforms.&nbsp;","Two of the people familiar with Consensys\u2019s recent funding discussions said that any resulting raise would be a \u201Cdown round,\u201D valuing the firm at less than $7 billion. Consensys again dismissed that claim.","\u201CConsensys is highly capitalized and has demonstrated strong performance across all areas year to date,\u201D the company spokesperson said. \u201CTherefore, our existing shareholders have no intention of accepting any dilution on terms inferior to our Series D. Any claims suggesting engagement with the company regarding discussions of a down round would be providing you with inaccurate information and may be an attempt to negotiate via the press on their part.\u201D&nbsp;","They added that Consensys has, in fact, been making use of its capital to hoover up its own shares.","\u201CThe company has ample cash, believes nearly all of the proposed secondary transactions we have been given notice of this year significantly undervalued the company and have been exercising our right of first refusal on them, accordingly,\u201D the spokesperson said.","Consensys has developed half a dozen core products, all aimed at widening access to the Ethereum ecosystem. Crypto wallet MetaMask and Infura, the developer platform, are its flagship tools. It recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238865\/consensys-linea-layer-2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">unveiled a Layer 2 network<\/a> called Linea, which aims to make Ethereum transactions up to 15 times cheaper.","Â© 2023 The Block.
