Yuga is looking to raise fresh funds at a valuation of as much as $5 billion, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/acc635d6-bb05-4af6-b4da-b8462c06466d\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a report<\/a> last month by the Financial Times.","The firm\u2019s collection of cartoon primates has surged to prominence over the past year, thanks in part to high profile purchases by celebrities such as Serena Williams, Jimmy Fallon and Snoop Dogg. Including sales on the secondary market, BAYC NFTs have changed hands for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/129084\/bored-ape-yacht-club-crosses-1-billion-in-total-sales\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">more than $1 billion<\/a> in total.","Now, Yuga plans to broaden its offering. The virtual land sales are the first phase of a metaverse initiative that aims to diversify revenue away from selling ape-based NFT images.","\u201CWe want to build something that expands the universe of the BAYC, but also invites the larger NFT community (and those priced out of BAYC membership) to join,\u201D the company explained in its deck.","To that end, Yuga is planning to build a gaming-focused metaverse named MetaRPG that will be compatible with a host of NFTs.","There will be a system \u2014 described as an \u201Cin-game app store\u201D \u2014 that will allow players to create characters using NFTs they own or from scratch, outfit them (again with NFTs), and use them in games, according to the deck.&nbsp;","Another crucial component of the proposed world is currency, which Yuga will provide in the form of a much-rumoured token named APECoin.","The token will be used to make purchases in Yuga\u2019s planned app store, and the company said in its deck that it will also encourage \u201Ctrading and bartering.\u201D","Yuga\u2019s grand metaverse plan will kick off with the sale of virtual land in the form of NFTs, which will be linked to plots in the metaverse game. These plots will contain distinct traits such as natural resources, artifacts, and in some cases rare characters.","In total, 200,000 plots will be distributed across two sales in March and August this year \u2014 and Yuga hopes to raise $178 million (in addition to secondary sale proceeds) from each sale. The company will retain a portion of the virtual land for itself. Animoca Brands, a digital studio that's also building a racing game with Yuga, will be involved in the launch, per the document.","BAYC <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BoredApeYC\/status\/1502056861624946688\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">teased a new partnership<\/a> with Animoca on March 11. No details were revealed, but interested parties were invited to complete identity checks to learn more at a later date. BAYC said in a tweet that the Animoca announcement had been in the works for seven months.","Yuga has had a busy start to the year. Last week, the company also announced it had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/137631\/bored-apes-creator-yuga-labs-acquires-ip-for-cryptopunks-and-meebits\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acquired the intellectual property rights<\/a> of CryptoPunks and Meebits, two prized NFT collections, from Larva Labs.","The Block reached out to Yuga Labs and Animoca for comment on this story but didn't hear back by press time.","Â© 2023 The Block.
