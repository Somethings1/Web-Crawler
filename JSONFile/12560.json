At the time, Smith said in a letter to shareholders that the business&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/blockchaincom-faces-270-mln-hit-loans-bankrupt-three-arrows-coindesk-2022-07-08\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">faced a $270 million hit<\/a> on its loans to the group.","Speaking about the impact of 3AC\u2019s collapse at the Token2049 conference in Singapore last week, Smith said the event had caused \u201Ca massive contraction in the credit markets.\u201D","\u201CI don\u2019t see the credit markets coming back in the same way. I think applying the models from TradFi to crypto won\u2019t work. I think you\u2019ll see credit stay overcollateralized, which is where most credit deals are today,\u201D he said.","\u201CThe crypto industry is going to need to find a way to finance liquidity and leverage in a more risk-controlled fashion, and I don\u2019t think the industry has quite figured that out yet.\u201D","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/158169\/three-arrows-capital-3ac-creditors-list-3-5-billion-crypto-affidavits\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">3AC owed creditors at least $3.5 billion when it filed for bankruptcy<\/a> last year, according to documents filed at the time. Since then, the fund\u2019s liquidators, Teneo, have repeatedly complained about a lack of cooperation from co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu.","In January, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-01-05\/3ac-liquidators-demand-documents-from-founders-via-twitter\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Teneo tried to subpoena the pair via a post on X (formerly Twitter)<\/a>. More recently, in June, reports surfaced that Teneo <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236717\/3ac-liquidators-seek-1-3-billion-from-zhu-davies-bloomberg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">aimed to recover $1.3 billion<\/a> from Davies and Zhu after alleging they were responsible for losses equal to that sum due to racking up debt in the months immediately before 3AC\u2019s collapse.","In its pomp, 3AC reportedly managed some $10 billion in assets and invested in everything from liquid tokens to startup equity and NFTs. Its founders built up sizeable followings on social media with brash posts about their investment ideas. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/149111\/su-zhu-says-his-supercycle-price-thesis-was-regrettably-wrong\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Zhu once espoused a so-called \u201Csupercycle\u201D thesis<\/a> that forecast the price of bitcoin hitting $2.5 million.","Such was 3AC\u2019s standing in the industry that it was able to borrow vast sums while offering disclosures that were relatively light on detail. One example \u2014 an excerpt from a one-page letter entitled \u201CAUM Report,\u201D part of a collection of affidavits obtained by The Block last year \u2014 shows Davies disclosing the fund\u2019s Net Asset Value to a lender in a single sentence.","\u201CCrypto had been a relatively high-trust environment for a long time,\u201D Smith said at the conference. \u201CThe Three Arrows collapse really was the first thing that made a lot of people question that, and it make the market really nervous about counter-party risk.\u201D","\u201CI can only speak in a general sense about the Three Arrows situation. The reality is that disclosures and risk reporting only work when the reports submitted are accurate.\u201D","When pressed, Smith declined to comment specifically on whether the reports Blockchain.com received were inaccurate. Zhu and Davies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Teneo did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
