I don't think we go back below $50,000-$55,000. I think that's the new floor unless something dramatic happens,\" Novogratz added.","There has been a sudden \"mindset shift\" in the market after spot bitcoin ETF approvals, according to Novogratz, who said Baby Boomers are getting their first shot at bitcoin by investing through registered investment advisors. Meanwhile, bitcoin holders don't like to sell, Novogratz said, adding that they often think of their net worth in terms of how many bitcoins they have and not how many dollars they possess.","Novogratz noted that bitcoin is currently in price discovery mode and could reach $100,000.","Spot bitcoin ETFs have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/282176\/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-15-billion-usd-aum?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">amassing<\/a> a significant amount of bitcoins. Asked if these ETFs will eventually hold all bitcoin, Novogratz said he doesn't think spot bitcoin ETFs will ever amass more than 20% of the total BTC.","\"They're loading up now. It will reach an equilibrium at one point,\" he said. \"And there are a lot of people who still want to custody their own coins or have them in a foreign location custody if they don't trust the country they're in.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The price of ether has also rallied in recent weeks, currently trading at around $4,000, mainly due to anticipation that spot <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248349\/ethereum-eth-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ethereum.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">ETH<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_positive\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      +0.30%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> ETFs will also get approved in the U.S. According to Novogratz, the Securities and Exchange Commission will eventually approve spot Ethereum ETFs.
