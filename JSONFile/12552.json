The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, its de facto central bank, launched a sandbox to stimulate communication between authorities and stablecoin issuers in complying with upcoming stablecoin regulations. <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Siu<\/span> added that he expects to see more stablecoin regulatory developments this year.","At the same time, Hong Kong is moving closer to approving its first line of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with multiple local finance firms, including Venture Smart Financial Holdings (VSFG), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/275718\/hong-kong-finance-firm-vsfg-targets-to-apply-for-spot-ethereum-etf-in-q2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">submitting<\/a> their applications to the Securities and Futures Commission.","The approval of Hong Kong\u2019s spot bitcoin ETFs may accelerate Web3 investments in the region, Siu told The Block.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s entirely possible that after Hong Kong approves bitcoin spot ETFs, it may actually have different types of ETFs ahead of the U.S. because it has broadly, more clarity in the regulatory framework,\u201D said Siu, who also saw potential for spot ether ETFs or funds based on GameFi tokens.&nbsp;<\/span>","The Animoca chairman said that the Web3 market is \u201Cback in a pretty big way\u201D in the crypto bull cycle, and that the market is \u201Cfundamentally much stronger\u201D from the perspective of a Web3 investment company.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCertainly in the near term, near to mid-term, I think Web3 is an Asia narrative because of the situation in the U.S.,\u201D said Siu, explaining the sensitivity of U.S.-based firms with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201CYou have more freedom and more flexibility in Asia.\u201D<\/span>","Animoca is currently focused on expanding its educational platform, Open Campus, while increasing investments in the field of Web3 gaming, Siu added.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
