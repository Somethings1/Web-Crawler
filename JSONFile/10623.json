A governance attack is one in which the hacker takes control of enough voting power to execute proposals designed to steal tokens from a protocol. In Swerve Finance\u2019s case, the attack has been continuing for more than a week.","It began when an address owned by an entity we\u2019ll refer to as \"Exploiter A\" for the purpose of this article launched the governance attack. This address did so by creating two proposals to transfer ownership of Swerve\u2019s remaining funds \u2014 worth $1.3 million \u2014 to the attacker\u2019s contract. The exploiter launched this attack with 348,000 of Swerve\u2019s governance tokens but was unsuccessful. This is because the attacker did not have enough tokens to meet the 51% token ownership to pass the proposal.","On-chain data shows exploiter A requesting assistance from another address, which we\u2019ll call \"Exploiter B.\" This new entity soon began voting on the proposal with 102,000 Swerve governance token. The combined voting power between these two entities is still not enough to pass the malicious governance proposal.","Wintermute\u2019s Head of Research Igor Igamberdiev believes he has&nbsp;<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FrankResearcher\/status\/1639371292502548485\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FrankResearcher\/status\/1639371292502548485\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">unmasked<\/a> the identity of the exploiter. Igamberdiev provided a trail of on-chain evidence, including transactions routed via the sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash, that linked to a specific individual. The analysis links wallet addresses associated with this individual to Exploiters A and B responsible for the governance attack.","Igamberdiev stated that he is \u201C100%\u201D sure the individual is the exploiter, adding, \u201CTiming is the usual heuristic to connect deposits and withdrawals.\u201D For context, timing here refers to the numerous instances where deposits and withdrawals linked to the individual and the two exploiter addresses appear to be connected.","The alleged exploiter did not respond to The Block\u2019s comments as of the time of reporting.","Igamberdiev stated that it was not too late for the exploiter to stop the attack. \u201CInstead, it's possible to help the community protect Swerve from future attacks, for example, by transferring ownership to the null address,\u201D Igamberdiev <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FrankResearcher\/status\/1639371308004700160\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FrankResearcher\/status\/1639371308004700160\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a>.","Â© 2023 The Block.
