Combined with the previously introduced burning mechanism \u2014 that burns a portion of fees generated through transactions \u2014 this has had the effect of reducing the supply of ether.","Since The Merge, the total supply of ether decreased by 75,000 ($134.5 million), representing an annual decrease of 0.114%.

Source: ultrasound.money<\/span>","With The Merge, however, came the temporary inability to unstake staked ether \u2014 an action that will become available shortly when Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/215604\/ethereum-takes-step-closer-to-shanghai-capella-with-deployment-on-sepolia-testnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">implemented<\/a> on April 12.","Shanghai will allow those who staked ether to withdraw their staked coins \u2014 but not all at once \u2014 and staking pools will be able to determine when they release the rewards.","Coinbase, for example, stated that it would begin accepting unstaking requests 24 hours after Shanghai completes. However, the exchange also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/coinbase\/status\/1636047283245531141\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> that \"demand for unstaking will be high soon after the upgrade and it may take the protocol weeks to months to process unstaking requests.\"","Ether staking behemoth Lido Finance <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LidoFinance\/status\/1635739580136652825\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shared<\/a> its expectations that stETH withdrawals won't launch on the mainnet until around mid-May \u2014 after code audits are complete and a two-week safety margin has been observed.","The potentially lengthy wait times are primarily due to technical on-chain limitations. Only 16 partial withdrawal requests \u2014 which comprise only staking rewards \u2014 can be processed every approximately 12 seconds. Because of this, the queue to withdraw when Shanghai goes live may become lengthy.&nbsp;Full withdrawals \u2014 when a validator completely removes itself from the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 may also take a relatively long time.","Â© 2023 The Block.
