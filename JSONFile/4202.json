Originating from a <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.mantle.xyz\/t\/archived-mantle-lsd\/7085\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal<\/a> in the Mantle governance forum in July 2023, the protocol allows users to stake ether and receive Mantle-staked ether (mETH) as a token representing their stake.","Governed by the Mantle decentralized autonomous organization, the protocol represents Mantle\u2019s expansion following its deployment of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239904\/ethereum-layer-2-mantle-network-mainnet-alpha-ethcc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Layer 2 network<\/a>.&nbsp;","Mantle began rolling out the liquid staking protocol (LSP) mainnet contracts in a restricted alpha phase in early October. The project has since moved to a permissionless phase, widening access and participation.","Liquid staking offers users the advantage of freeing up capital from staked assets. However, its widespread use on Ethereum has led to a concentration of ether stakes with major providers such as Lido, Coinbase, Binance, and others. The Mantle team claims it wants to broaden the range of available solutions to address this issue of stake concentration.","\u201CThe concentration of ETH staking is a result of network effect through a feedback loop of increasing name recognition and use case,\u201D said Jordi Alexander, Chief Alchemist at Mantle. \u201CBy focusing on mETH\u2019s adoption in LSDfi both in the Mantle ecosystem and beyond, and its capital efficiency in maintaining the highest sustainable yield, Mantle LSP intends to be a part of the solution by creating more options for users.\u201D","Mantle DAO, following the approval of governance proposal <a href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bitdao.eth\/proposal\/0xa34107e34b4dc4ff4cd16b77d66e62a51f4d35457a4f4b1f68ab8ac821f58561\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MIP-25<\/a> in August, has elected to stake ether from its treasury using its own protocol.
