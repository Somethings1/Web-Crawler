Rather than sending money to a long and complicated Ethereum address, you just use the .eth name. Ethereum names can also be connected to other information, like email addresses and a Twitter account.","What we know is that the wallet had been bidding on paradigm.eth for months, making smaller offers. It wasn\u2019t until the weekend that the previous owner of the Ethereum name accepted the offer.","But it appears to be some kind of prank or joke purchase. As Millegan <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BrantlyMillegan\/status\/1447246131436601348\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pointed out<\/a>, the Ethereum name\u2019s records were set to some bizarre links. For a start, the buyer set the email to <a href=\"\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection#1f7c7e6d7a7a6d6c5f727c7b70717e737b6c317c7072\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"492a283b2c2c3b3a09242a2d262728252d3a672a2624\">[email&nbsp;protected]<\/span><\/a> \u2014 a bit of a long-running joke in the cryptosphere \u2014&nbsp;before setting the associated image to the SushiSwap logo.&nbsp;","Other strange elements include the Twitter account pointing to VC firm a16z and the GitHub link to YFI founder Andre Cronje\u2019s GitHub. Plus the description shows up as, \u201CSkate on the Paradigm and shift it when I feel like.\u201D","As one Twitter commentator <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EnlightenedLime\/status\/1447248995882049537\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pointed out<\/a>, \u201CIf this is a troll, it has to be the most expensive troll ever, right?\u201D","Millegan acknowledged that the sale could be some kind of wash trading. This is the idea that somebody could be selling the name to themselves in order to make it look like a really expensive trade, while in reality they would be just shuffling money between their own wallets.","But this doesn\u2019t particularly explain the previous bids that weren\u2019t accepted (unless this was part of a strategy) and even if that was the case, they would have had to stump up some heavy fees to the NFT marketplace OpenSea where the sale was made \u2014 some $37,500.","If the sale was legitimate \u2014 even if for a prank \u2014 then it would rank in the upper echelons of highest domain name sales in history.&nbsp;","<i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For more breaking stories like this, make sure to follow The Block on&nbsp;<\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a><\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/i>"],"hashtag":["CRYPTO","ETHEREUM"]}
