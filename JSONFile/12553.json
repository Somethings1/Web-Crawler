The prosecutors also asked for their passports to be invalidated \u2014 except for Nicholas Platias, another Terraform Labs founder, who is not a Korean national.","Due to the length of time it may take to invalidate the passports \u2014 local media suggests up to a month \u2014 authorities will continue to pressure Kwon to return to South Korea. His last known whereabouts were in Singapore, where he has been based for much of the Terra collapse, and invalidating his passport would make him unable to travel.","In May, the company's algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD, depegged from the dollar, ultimately collapsing the Terra ecosystem and wiping out around $40 billion in value. While Terraform Labs and related entity the Luna Foundation Guard attempted to repeg TerraUSD, they were ultimately unsuccessful.","Kwon has since released plans to try and rebuild the Terra ecosystem, but remains subject to lawsuits from angry investors.","In an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163521\/south-korean-investigators-havent-reached-out-about-terra-collapse-says-do-kwon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interview<\/a> in August, he said he had not been contacted at all by Korean investigators and that it was hard to make a decision about returning to South Korea, but emphasized he wasn't in Singapore for the purpose of evading investigators. He added that dealing with due process was not a question of what you are prepared to face but how you are going to face it.","\u201CW<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hat we're going to do is we're just going to put out the the facts as we know them. We're going to be totally honest and deal with whatever consequences as they may be,\u201D he said.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
