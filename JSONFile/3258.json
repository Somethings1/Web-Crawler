So this idea that kind of internet culture is just going to become mainstream culture, I think is already proven out. And now I think NFTs are the next chapter in that story.\"","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Vasudev and Chaparro also discuss:<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
