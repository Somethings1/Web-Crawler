William Lacy Clay (D-MO), Chairman of the Housing, Community Development and Insurance Subcommittee; U.S. Rep. Al Green (D-TX), Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee; and U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-MA), Chairman of the Task Force on Financial Technology all addressed their concerns to Zuckerberg, as well as COO Sheryl Sandberg and Calibra CEO David Marcus in an open <a href=\"https:\/\/financialservices.house.gov\/uploadedfiles\/07.02.2019_-_fb_ltr.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter<\/a>.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The letter alleges the Libra system, which set up shop in Switzerland a few months ago, is intended to rival U.S. monetary policy and the dollar.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"This raises serious privacy, trading, national security, and monetary policy concerns for not only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/30333\/india-not-keen-on-allowing-facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook's<\/a> over 2 billion users, but also for investors, consumers, and the broader global economy,\" the lawmakers wrote.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The letter also claims the system could become \"an under-regulated platform for illicit activity and money laundering.\" These concerns arise from the lack of information contained in Libra's white paper, according to the signatories.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As justification for the concerns expressed, the letter makes reference to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the political consulting firm accessed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/32512\/analysis-democrats-more-negative-than-republicans-at-house-hearing-on-facebooks-libra\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook<\/a> user data to influence voting behavior in the 2016 election.

Indeed Zuckerberg has mostly remained silent when Congress previously mailed him questions on Libra \u2013 first in May when Congress asked about the possibility of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/30058\/nobel-prize-winning-economist-joseph-stiglitz-weighs-in-on-facebooks-libra\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook<\/a> crypto after outlets first reported rumors of the coin, and again when Waters called for the initial moratorium last month. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Marcus, however, is reportedly slated to testify at both Senate and House hearings on Libra, which are scheduled for July 16 and 17, respectively.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
