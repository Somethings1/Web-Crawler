The filing noted that it limited its treasury holdings to bitcoin, ether, and \u201Cany other cryptocurrency\u201D which regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission will likely not view as a security.","Reddit has pursued crypto-related projects in the past, most notably its series of Polygon-based NFTs which the company calls Collectible Avatars, shying away from the \"NFT\" term which has proven controversial to users of the site. At their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/191984\/reddit-digital-collectible-minting-hits-all-time-high\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">peak of popularity<\/a>, hundreds of thousands of collectibles were minted each day.&nbsp;","Reddit also experimented with blockchain-based rewards called Community Points for several popular subreddits, including the \/r\/CryptoCurrency forum; however, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/258016\/reddit-plans-to-sunset-its-blockchain-based-reward-service-community-points\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sunset the program<\/a> last October, citing problems with regulation and scalability.&nbsp;","To go public, Reddit requires approval from the SEC and first filed its paperwork confidentially with the regulator in December 2021. The company, which is seeking to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker RDDT, has yet to reveal the amount or price of the shares. A panoply of Wall Street\u2019s largest institutions \u2014 Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Bank of America Securities \u2014 are leading the underwriting, along with Citigroup and Deutsche Bank among others getting in on the action.","Reddit noted that it acquires crypto \u201Cin exchange for goods and services.\u201D On its balance sheet, it assesses its holdings quarterly \u201Cor more frequently\u201D for impairments, which is then put on its income statement under general and administrative expenses. However, if the price of its holdings subsequently rises, the company noted in its filings, that won\u2019t show up until the crypto is sold.","As is standard practice, Reddit added disclaimers on many of its business practices and outlooks, but it was noteworthy that the company had this sentence in its disclaimer on cryptocurrencies: \u201CWhile we believe cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have significant potential, the popularity and prevalence of cryptocurrencies is a relatively recent trend, and whether cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology will continue to be adopted by consumers and businesses in the long term is uncertain.\u201D","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
