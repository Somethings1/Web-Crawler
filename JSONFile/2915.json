Those court documents also claim that the employee was working in \"an unsuitable work environment,\" according to Calcalist.","StakeHound contracted Coincover's service as well in holding the keys, but in order for the keys to be verified, Fireblocks had to also retain a copy.

Fireblocks agreed to temporarily store the BLS keyshares, but because it doesn't support BLS with its platform, Fireblocks said the same backup procedures that are normally found on Fireblocks didn't apply. The keys remained in temporary storage, and a few months later temporary storage failed.","In the lead-up to the failure of the temporary storage, Fireblocks alleges that StakeHound also failed to store backups with a third-party service provider despite urging the firm to do so multiple times. It also communicated that StakeHound was required to perform a backup within 14 days of the key generation. StakeHound has not said whether it followed these directions.","Fireblocks is still trying to recover the lost ETH, according to its blog post.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":[]}
