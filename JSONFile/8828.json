We take this matter seriously and are currently investigating the situation.\"","The exchange explained that attackers were able to withdraw assets in ether, shiba inu, QNT, GALA, HOT and MATIC \u2014 but only exploited a hot wallet that holds less than 5% of its overall funds. \"The rest of our wallets remain secure and have not been compromised,\" it stated.","Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges typically use a combination of cold and hot wallets to manage user funds. Cold wallets \u2014 offline storage solutions \u2014 offer greater security against cyber attacks. Hot wallets connected to the internet allow for fast deposits and withdrawals but are more vulnerable to hacks.","Bitrue temporarily suspended all withdrawals and plans to reopen them on April 18.","\"All identified users who are affected by this incident will be compensated in full,\" it wrote.","The tokens are currently held in an address starting with 0x181.","The Bitrue incident is the second major attack targeting centralized exchanges in recent days.
