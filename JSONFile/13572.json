It lets users swap and stake tokens within the wallet extension.","Now that it's multichain, each user will see an Ethereum and Polygon address for each wallet address. They can see all their funds on the three networks in one place for each wallet. They will be able to make transactions from the wallet to either of the three blockchains depending on which asset they are moving \u2014 instead of having to change the network, which is how MetaMask works.","The wallet will also contain features for NFT holders. It will show specific data related to NFT collections, like the floor price \u2014 the lowest value of all NFTs on sale \u2014 and the amount the NFT was purchased for. Users can also list their NFTs on marketplaces directly from Phantom.","\u201CWe believe that the future of digital asset management lies in cross-chain interoperability, and we're committed to providing our users with the tools and resources they need to easily navigate and transact across various blockchain networks,\" said Brandon Millman, co-founder and CEO of Phantom. \u201CBy bridging the gap between different protocols, we're enabling a new era of decentralized innovation for all digital asset users.\u201D","Phantom has also introduced a few security measures. These include transaction simulation so that users get a better picture of what transactions they are signing and NFT spam filtering \u2014 hiding suspicious NFTs from wallets to prevent attacks. The wallet will also block access to malicious websites.","(<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updates story in first paragraph to add May 1 date.<\/em>)","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
