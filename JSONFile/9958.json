In the Fed board\u2019s eyes, Custodia received an \u2018F\u2019 on its pre-application exam. The order itself was published weeks after the announced rejection because the central bank redacts sensitive information around business plans.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Fed concluded that \u201Cfindings indicated Custodia\u2019s risk management and controls for its core banking activities were insufficient, particularly with respect to overall risk management; compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. sanctions; information technology; internal audit; financial projections; and liquidity risk management practices.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Those \u201Cdeficiencies\u201D and a \u201Cnovel\u201D business model focused largely on crypto-related activities with no federal deposit insurance worried the Fed, which called Custodia\u2019s plan \u201Can unprecedented business model that presents heightened risks involving activities that no state member bank previously has been approved to conduct.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Fed's Board of Governors also cast doubt on Custodia\u2019s ability to make money in the future.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIndeed, some products that are estimated to be significant sources of revenue were still in the \u2018conceptualization phase,\u2019 and policies, procedures, and processes related to planned crypto-asset-related activities remained in the early stages of development, especially in the area of compliance,\u201D the Board of Governors said.<\/span>","The central bank noted that Custodia's revenue and funding model relied \"almost solely\" on an \"active and vibrant\" crypto market, then went on to cite events like the bankruptcies of&nbsp; <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and FTX as proof that \"the global and largely unregulated or noncompliant crypto-asset sector lacks stability and that dislocations in the sector can result in stress at financial institutions focused on serving the crypto-asset sector.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Fed also said Custodia\u2019s business model largely relied on a series of business activities that it saw as too risky for member banks to participate in, due to the potential liability to U.S. taxpayers in the event of a failure.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C[I]n the event Custodia\u2019s application were to be approved, the Board would prohibit Custodia from engaging in a number of those activities because Custodia has not demonstrated that it can conduct the activities in a safe and sound manner and, in some cases, also because the activities would be impermissible for a national bank,\u201D the Fed order reads, adding that it does not believe Custodia can survive as a business without those activities, citing Custodia\u2019s own financial statements made to examiners.&nbsp;<\/span>","Custodia management anticipated the failure of their application, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/150686\/digital-asset-bank-custodia-is-suing-the-federal-reserve-over-an-application-delay\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filing suit<\/a> against the Fed months before the central bank made its final judgment. It accused the central bank of a bias against crypto in response to today's disclosure.","\u201CThe recently released Fed order is the result of numerous procedural abnormalities, factual inaccuracies that the Fed refused to correct, and general bias against digital assets,\u201D Custodia Bank spokesperson Nathan Miller said in an emailed statement. \u201CRather than choosing to work with a bank utilizing a low-risk, fully-reserved business model, the Fed instead demonstrated its shortsightedness and inability to adapt to changing markets.","That same management&nbsp;didn't avoid criticism either. <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Fed wrote that \u201Cthe depth of relevant banking experience and bank-specific risk management experience among Custodia\u2019s board of directors and management team is limited\u201D and that \u201Cthe number and degree of shortcomings identified in the pre-membership examination suggest that management\u2019s experience is not commensurate with the firm\u2019s intended risk profile.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Fed also says it would be \u201Cunprecedented\u201D to approve membership of a bank without deposit insurance, like Custodia, an issue that has received more scrutiny in the weeks since the rejection due largely to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the order, which was written and delivered well-before <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/218838\/silicon-valley-bank-closed-by-california-regulator\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure<\/a>, the Fed notes that the lack of deposit insurance could raise risk for a bank run at Custodia. Crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank, a Fed member and, like Custodia, a state-chartered bank, saw troubles emerge late last year due to its large exposure to the digital asset industry through companies including FTX and the failed Facebook-led stablecoin project Diem, additional context the Fed considered Custodia\u2019s application.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Banks accepted to the Fed system gain access to ongoing facilities run by the central bank that helps provide additional low-cost liquidity to member banks. The central bank carefully guards access to its system largely because of that access, and bank regulators are conservative in their evaluations of bank business models due to a strong aversion to failures, which can necessitate government intervention, as has recently happened with Silicon Valley and Signature Banks.
