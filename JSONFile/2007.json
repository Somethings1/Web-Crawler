The banking ban prompted several exchanges to file petitions that sought to overturn the RBI move, a process that culminated in Wednesday's ruling.","The RBI now indeed has an option under law to file a review petition in the case, a lawyer, who wishes to remain anonymous, told The Block. However, \"grounds for review are generally narrow,\" the lawyer added.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAccording to the Constitution of India, a judgment of the Supreme Court <a href=\"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/explained\/supreme-court-babri-masjid-ram-temple-review-petition-6135075\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">becomes<\/a> the law of the land and is final because it provides certainty for deciding future cases.

Ashim Sood, principal of Ashim Sood Law Offices, represented IAMAI in the case.","Sood declined to comment to The Block on the review petition report.","While the Supreme Court may look at the RBI's review petition, crypto platforms in India can operate as of now, Abhishek Rastogi, partner at Khaitan &amp; Co., who had filed a case in Delhi High Court (later transferred to the Supreme Court), told The Economic Times. \"Many companies have even gone bankrupt after the RBI's diktat and they may also look to initiate action in this regard,\" Rastogi said."],"hashtag":[]}
