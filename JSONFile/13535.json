Price downturns appear to have had an effect, with both illicit and legitimate volumes trending lower compared with this time last year. Still, Chainalysis noted that illicit activity appears to be more resilient, since volumes are down only 15% from last year compared to 36% for legitimate activity.","Scam revenue for this year is 65% lower compared with July of 2021, clocking in at $1.6 billion. Chainalysis proposes that this is linked to price declines, since scam revenue has fallen relatively in line with the price of bitcoin since the start of this year. The number of transfers to scams at this point in the year is also the lowest seen in four years. Still, the report noted that scam revenue is also driven by high-profile schemes, which 2022 has yet to see.","\"Those numbers suggest that fewer people than ever are falling for cryptocurrency scams,\" the firm said in its report. \"One reason for this could be that with asset prices falling, cryptocurrency scams \u2014 which typically present themselves as passive crypto investing opportunities with enormous promised returns \u2014 are less enticing to potential victims.\"","Additionally, a price downturn means less hype, which tends to be a factor in drawing in inexperienced users, according to Chainalysis.&nbsp;","Darknet market revenue charted a different path. The activity was tracking higher than the previous year in April, but saw a drop off past that point. Chainalysis pointed to the shut down and sanction of the Hydra marketplace, which drew substantial dark market activity. However, activity returned, which Chainalysis hypothesizes is due to Hydra users migrating to new markets in the wake of the crackdown.","\"Nevertheless, the decline in darknet market revenue \u2014 and indeed, cryptocurrency value received by all criminal categories \u2014 following Hydra\u2019s shutdown shows the tangible impact of law enforcement\u2019s growing ability to fight cryptocurrency-based crime,\" Chainalysis said.","Meanwhile, hacks and the amount of stolen funds are up compared to last year. According to Chainalysis, $1.9 billion worth of crypto has been stolen as of July, compared with $1.2 billion in July of 2021.
