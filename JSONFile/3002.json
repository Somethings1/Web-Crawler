He said the exchange was a sloppy place with bad accounting. \u201CI remember one time I found millions of dollars worth of airdrops that they had gotten that they didn't know about,\u201D he said.&nbsp;","\u201CI don't think it's that impressive that they did it,\u201D he added. \u201CI think if you two handed this to any crypto firm, like if Binance bought them, they would have found all those assets in like two days and already had it back to the users.\u201D","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1Z9heVKU9sg?si=DLle1fzoU5YtLCx4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Tackett added that he was surprised the liquidators hadn\u2019t got more of the hacked funds back or worked out who did it. He said that if he had to guess who hacked the exchange, he would say a higher up former FTX or Alameda employee.&nbsp;","\u201CAnd when I talked to Sam about it after \u2014 or like when everything was blowing up \u2014 he seemed so nonchalant, like, \u2018Oh yeah, it was the battle between FTX.US and FTX.com to get assets like it's not lost\u2019. So, I mean, I think he has some information on what happened to it, but I don\u2019t know,\u201D he said.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
