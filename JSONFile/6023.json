Speaking with The Block following today\u2019s hearing, he maintained that he would be open to authorizing the Fed to issue a CBDC, as long as it was not a means of pushing out private operators.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt all comes down to design,\u201D Toomey told The Block. \u201CIf design goes badly, then we\u2019re much better off not having a central bank digital dollar. But if it\u2019s properly designed, then I think it could make sense as long as we allow privately issued stablecoins to exist.\u201D<\/span>","It's a critical question at this point. The President's Working Group has said outright that Congress should tightly restrict stablecoin issuance, with the Financial Stability Oversight Council <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/127997\/fsoc-says-it-will-seek-to-mitigate-stablecoin-risks-if-congress-doesnt\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">further threatening to take steps<\/a> should Congress fail to act.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Regarding any direct Fed accounts, Toomey maintained that commercial banks still need to act as intermediaries.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In his final questions to the Fed chair, Toomey sought to confirm such limits on a CBDC. And Powell seemed to be on board, based on the dialogue. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Specifically, Toomey did not want the Fed to handle accounts for retail users, nor did he want a CBDC to crowd out private stablecoins.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSome have advocated,\u201D said Toomey, \u201Cthat individual Americans have retail accounts with the Fed. It seems to me there is absolutely nothing in the history, experience, expertise of the fed that lend the Fed to be a retail organization.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI would say yes,\u201D agreed Powell.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Toomey continued to ask, given congressional authorization for a CBDC: \u201CIs there anything about that that ought to preclude a well-regulated private stablecoin from coexisting with a digital dollar?\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Powell was similarly in Toomey\u2019s corner, saying: \u201CNo, not at all.\u201D<\/span>","However, Powell himself has been hesitant to throw his support behind any Fed issuance of a CBDC.","At a hearing before the Banking Committee in July, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/111538\/fed-chair-powell-legitimately-undecided-on\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">he called himself \"legitimately undecided\"<\/a> on the benefits of a digital dollar. While he may have changed his position, he has not made that change public. And despite a great deal of interest in the Fed's delayed report on cryptocurrencies, in today's hearing, he cautioned against setting expectations unnecessarily high, calling the pending report \"more an exercise in asking questions and seeking answers from the public\u201D than a proverbial Magna Carta for digital dollar issuance.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
