This dynamic prevented pull queries issued by the validator from being processed in a timely manner and led to consensus stalling (as no polls were being handled).\"","The team requested validators to update their nodes to AvalancheGo v1.11.1 to address the issue. \"As soon as a sufficient amount of stake upgrades to this release, consensus should return to normal,\" it said.","At 11:36 a.m. ET Avalanche said that block finalization on the primary network was resuming and the team was monitoring stability. The team finally confirmed the incident had been resolved at 12:43 p.m. ET \u2014 some six hours after the outage began.","Prior to today, there was a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/markets\/2023\/03\/23\/avalanche-blockchains-x-and-c-networks-see-brief-outage\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">brief outage<\/a> in March 2023, affecting subnets C-chain and X-Chain.","On Feb. 1, block ingestion on Avalanche <a href=\"https:\/\/status.avax.network\/incidents\/4vq54hv6b9t4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">was delayed<\/a> due to an issue with an infrastructure provider, though it did not affect the performance or stability of the Avalanche network or any Subnets, the team <a href=\"https:\/\/status.avax.network\/incidents\/4vq54hv6b9t4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> at the time.","Layer 1 blockchain competitor Solana also suffered an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/276237\/solana-network-restarts-after-outage-that-lasted-five-hours\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">outage<\/a> earlier this month following a series of such incidents during 2022.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with additional details throughout.<\/em>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
