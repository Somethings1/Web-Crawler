Lawyers for the ex-billionaire say he should be presumed innocent and allowed to access the insurance to bolster his defense in court.&nbsp;In their words, denying him access to the plan would be \u201Cunequal and unfair treatment.\u201D","\u201CIt's completely right to say that he hasn't been found guilty of anything yet, but the scope of the fraud and what he's been accused of is certainly far from ordinary,\u201D said Matthew Gold, a partner at the law firm Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolff &amp; Cohen.","<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bankman-Fried claimed in December that he had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/201323\/unemployed-and-under-house-arrest-sam-bankman-fried-faces-enormous-legal-bills\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">less than $100,000<\/a> left in his bank account.

If the judge lifts the stay and allows Bankman-Fried to access the policy, and the insurance provider determines he is covered, he could essentially get an FTX-linked payout before any of the exchange\u2019s creditors.","A Bankman-Fried spokesperson declined to comment.","The full scope of Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal bills is unclear, although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/201323\/unemployed-and-under-house-arrest-sam-bankman-fried-faces-enormous-legal-bills\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">experts<\/span><\/a> estimate his defense may cost millions. Along with his criminal case, Bankman-Fried is active in the FTX bankruptcy and faces lawsuits from U.S. regulators.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CLegal expenses just can grow. You know, it's almost one of those situations where if you have to ask, why bother?\u201D Gold said. \u201CThe expenses can be huge. Litigation is expensive.\u201D","The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors objected to Bankman-Fried\u2019s motion, saying that any cash he receives is money that could go to the FTX creditors. Director and officer liability insurance typically protects the executives of a company in the event that they are targeted by legal action.","\u201CFor every dollar extended by the insurance carrier to Mr. Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense costs, there is one less dollar to pay\" those that are owed money by FTX,&nbsp; the committee said.&nbsp;","The committee also said that the insurance plan exists to protect the company and its directors \u201Cin situations where they make honest decisions in the ordinary course of the business. \u201CThis is not that case,\u201D the committee said, pointing out Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal fraud charges.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers slammed the committee\u2019s objections, saying that he is not explicitly seeking the entire $10 million sum available under the insurance plan.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CMr. Bankman-Fried is like any other former director or officer of a company who seeks access to a D&amp;O insurance policy to pay for legal fees. Coverage under the D&amp;O Policies for those legal fees does not change simply because the debtors, the committee, and some class action plaintiffs believe or hope that Mr. Bankman-Fried is guilty,\u201D Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201CThis court should not approve of this unequal and unfair treatment.\u201D","For their part, the FTX debtors have also raised questions about Bankman-Fried\u2019s motion, although they say they are contractually obligated not to oppose it in court. The former CEO\u2019s request is \u201Cunfair\u201D and \u201Cinequitable,\u201D lawyers said, pointing out that other FTX employees are also under legal scrutiny. Lawyers for the debtors did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;","\u201CMultiple other current and former directors, officers and employees are facing government inquiries and other claims covered by the D&amp;O Policies. All are looking to the same, limited insurance,\" the FTX debtors said in a court filing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The crypto exchange suggested that if the court lifts the stay on the insurance policy, it should be lifted for all who are eligible to use it, rather than only Bankman-Fried.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\"If the court is inclined to lift the automatic stay ... the court should enter relief broad enough to allow the insurers to pay any or all insureds, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policies, and not just Mr. Bankman-Fried,\" the FTX lawyers said.&nbsp;","Even if Bankman-Fried\u2019s push to access the insurance policy is successful and he receives a payout, he could still face legal hurdles tied to the policy, experts say.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> The insurance firms did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;<\/span>","The former crypto boss is facing an October criminal trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. He\u2019s facing a litany of criminal charges including bank fraud and making illegal political donations. He could spend the rest of his life in jail if convicted on all counts.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CCoverage is not black and white,\u201D said Richard Mico, the U.S. CEO and chief legal officer of Banxa, a payment-and-compliance infrastructure provider to the global crypto industry. \u201CIt is very possible that SBF will still initially be covered under the arrangements until, if at all, a final court determination is made regarding his conduct.\u201D","\u201CIn other words, he\u2019s innocent until proven otherwise,\u201D Mico added. \u201CIf SBF is proven guilty, he may be required to repay.\u201D","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
