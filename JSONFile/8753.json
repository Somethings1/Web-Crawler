I will be the chairman of Bitdeer. Matt Kong will be the CEO of Bitdeer. Antpool will soon be spun off into an independent company to be led by Micree,\" Wu wrote.","The purpose of the spinoff is to streamline <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/5311\/bitmains-landmark-plan-to-list-on-the-hong-kong-stock-exchange-in-doubt\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain's<\/a> business model to make pursuing a public offering easier.","As part of the settlement deal, Bitmain's B and B+ round investors, who poured in more than $700 million into the firm in 2018, got their number of shares tripled as compensation of valuation adjustments.","Indeed, based on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/50798\/chinese-court-freezes-bitmains-500k-worth-of-stake-in-its-subsidiary\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain's<\/a> outdated IPO prospectus in 2018, Wu and several other founding members \u2013 excluding Zhan \u2013 were holding about 34% of Bitmain's shares. A deal of $600 million to purchase nearly half of that ownership would render a valuation of about $4 billion, which is down from a whopping $14.5 billion valuation in the summer of 2018.","\"Upon the closing of the settlement today, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/4875\/bitmains-development-center-in-israel-is-shutting-down-amid-the-bear-market\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain<\/a> has turned over a new page with great opportunities ahead.
