In the span of six minutes, the wallet made <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/txs?a=0x59abf3837fa962d6853b4cc0a19513aa031fd32b\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">12 transactions<\/a>, each sending 15,000 ether to different crypto wallet addresses. None of the 12 new wallet addresses have yet done anything with the funds.","The previously mentioned transfers of ether for renBTC have put negative sell pressure on ether, with the price on Sunday dropping almost 5%.

Swapping into stablecoins on Ethereum isn't a valid option, either, as they would be frozen by legal authorities immediately.","The \"FTX drainer\" wallet has slowly dropped in the rankings of top ether holders. It originally was in the top 30, but fell to 36th place after the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/188710\/ftx-drainer-swaps-another-20000-ether-for-bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">selling this morning.<\/a> The identity of the wallet holder is unknown.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">(Updates with comment from The Block VP of Research Larry Cermak in 5th paragraph.)<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
