Bitfinex repaid $100 million each in 2019 and 2020.","Bitfinex general counsel Stuart Hoegner told The Block that the loan was taken out because Bitfinex was in a \"short-term need for cash, and Tether was prepared to lend on commercially reasonable terms.\" In 2019, the New York Attorney General's (NYAG's) office argued in court documents that Bitfinex lost $850 million after payment processor Crypto Capital seized the funds, alleging that the exchange secretly covered the shortfall via the Tether credit line.","The case has been ongoing since then.
