One of the first to testify, Jeremy Allaire of Circle, mentioned that the company receives regular attestations from a leading public accounting firm. And a legend in the making, Sam Bankman Fried, CEO of FTX.com, had an eye on the future when he noted that these attestations can, and will be, more real-time.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Transparency reporting services provide multiple benefits, in addition to creating trust and fostering the adoption of digital assets.
