Client spikes in RAM and CPU occurred and developers will gauge the number of lost versus recorded credential update messages over the coming days, said Beiko.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The stress test also revealed a bug between a proof-of-stake client, Prysm, and the Besu client which is designed for permissioned use cases. To sync properly, Prysm client expects a certain number of responses; however, Besu imposes response limitations that bring it below the necessary syncing threshold, Beiko said. The Besu team is looking into the matter.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After a discussion on how to best optimize initial client orientation, developers ultimately <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TimBeiko\/status\/1626264630581694464?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">decided<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to completely ban blobless 4844 transactions, which would change client assumptions around the transactions and could complicate setup.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Developers also discussed how to move ahead with the deprecation of the SELFDESTRUCT keyword, which terminates a contract, removes the contract\u2019s bytecode from the blockchain, and reroutes funds on the contact to a specified address.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the path forward remains unclear, there are three current proposals on the subject in discussion as developers seek to find \u201Cdeactivating options that don't break things,\u201D Beiko said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe challenge here is it opens up a nasty attack vector: deploy a contract, fill storage in a certain way, and when you redeploy the contract, the old storage is still there, and could be accessed in malicious ways,\u201D Beiko said.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
