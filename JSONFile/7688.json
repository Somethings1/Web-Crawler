Blobstream acts as a data availability (DA) layer, securely storing large amounts of data off-chain while offering verifiable proofs of its existence.","The collaboration enables off-chain scaling solutions on Starknet to use Celestia, aiming to minimize transaction costs. It involves Starknet developers porting Blobstream to Cairo \u2014 Starknet\u2019s primary programming language \u2014 to support the development of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/240480\/starknet-appchains-framework\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Layer 3 appchains<\/a>. Such Layer 3s on Starknet are currently in the development phase.","\u201CSettling high-throughput appchains on Starknet with Celestia as a modular DA is a game-changing combination,\u201D Starknet noted.","Celestia was the first project to implement \"data availability sampling,\" allowing validators on scaling networks to sample a significant part of data for availability verification, which enhances efficiency and throughput compared to full data verification.","Layer 2 projects like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268071\/manta-pacific-celestia\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Manta Pacific<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/274039\/aevo-intends-to-open-up-its-rollup-for-other-protocols-to-build-on-it\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aevo<\/a>, and ZKFair have already used its DA to develop Validiums, scaling solutions that combine zero-knowledge proofs with an external DA.
