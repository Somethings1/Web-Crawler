Not only did Ethereum activate The Merge as it shifted to proof-of-stake, but the Biden administration also dropped its much-anticipated digital asset reports. Additionally, South Korean courts put out a warrant for the arrest of Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon \u2014 that's quite a week!","Here are the three biggest stories:&nbsp;","On Sept. 15 at 6:44 am UTC, Ethereum's Merge upgrade was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169299\/ethereum-activates-the-merge-as-it-shifts-to-proof-of-stake\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">finally activated<\/a>, a development that had been in the works since 2020. This was the final step in the blockchain's transition to proof-of-stake, meaning that the use of computing power to validate the network (or mining) is no longer needed to validate transactions.&nbsp;","\"And we finalized! Happy merge all. This is a big moment for the Ethereum ecosystem.
