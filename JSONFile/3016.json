As a result, buyers of TwelveFold will need an empty Bitcoin address to receive the art.","\"Wallets do not currently support the transfer of individual satoshis,\" Yuga Labs told The Block, meaning that users risk transferring their inscribed satoshi's if their digital artifacts are stored together with other bitcoin holdings.","Each of the art pieces, generated by Yuga Labs using 3D modeling technology among other techniques, will be available to purchase in an auction held later this week.&nbsp;","All bids will be made in bitcoin.","Â© 2023 The Block.
