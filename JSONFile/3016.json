It also significantly counters the long-term upward trend and is the largest drop in history.","As The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/109315\/bitcoin-hashrate-declines-50-percent-china-mining-crackdown\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has reported<\/a>, the main cause for the falling hash rate is the crackdown on bitcoin mining in China. After a high-level comment was made during the China State Council meeting last month, regions across China <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/107707\/xinjiang-bitcoin-miner-shut-crackdown-china\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">started issuing notices<\/a> for miners to cease their operations. This has led to a huge decline in China's contribution to the hash rate.","Another impact has been the falling price of bitcoin, which has dropped from a peak price of $63,500 in April to its current price of $35,300. This has made it less profitable to mine bitcoin (although the declining hash rate will counteract that).","Bitcoin's hash rate is not the only on-chain metric in decline.","The number of daily transactions on the bitcoin network <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/transactions-on-the-bitcoin-network-daily\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has fallen<\/a> to levels not seen since July 2018. According to the dashboard, just 200,000 transactions are being made per day (on average over the last seven days).","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/transactions-on-the-bitcoin-network-daily\/embed\" title=\"Transactions on the Bitcoin Network (Daily, 7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","There has also been a decline in the number of active addresses on the network, although it only returns to April 2020 levels. The number of daily active addresses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/number-of-active-addresses-on-the-bitcoin-network-7dma\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has gone down<\/a> from 1.23 million to 765,000 per day \u2014 and far fewer new addresses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/number-of-new-addresses-on-the-bitcoin-network-7dma\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">are being created<\/a> every day.","Bitcoin transaction fees are also much lower now, although this makes the network cheaper to use.
