Communities can build new clients and APIs on top of the protocol and will be in charge of writing their own rules for moderation and monetization.","\"Any group can use Towns to assemble and chat freely in a space designed to their needs\u2014 without ever having to worry that some organization will change the rules, profit off their activity, or take away their rights,\" said the company in the blog post.","The&nbsp; Towns network itself is an end-to-end encrypted near real-time communication system powered by a distributed proof-of-stake network of nodes, the company said.","Alongside the protocol, an app will launch that offers the encrypted chat experience without the complexities of dealing with the protocol and network.","\"While this will be the first Towns app, it will be one of many as anyone can build clients against the Towns protocol to fit their specific needs,\" the company said.","HNT Labs will first steward the governance of Towns. The plan is to eventually transition this to Towns DAO as the network decentralizes.","\"The team\u2019s vision for creating a digital town square where members can define the borders, set the rules, and build the world they want is an ambitious goal that is uniquely achievable through the promise of decentralization and web3,\" said Sriram Krishnan, a partner at a16z, in a blog post.","A16z crypto have led several raises in the web3 space in recent weeks including <a href=\"https:\/\/a16zcrypto.com\/azra-games-seed-extension\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Azra Games' $10 million extension round<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/16\/stelo-labs-raises-6m-in-a16z-led-round-to-help-crypto-wallet-users-protect-themselves\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stelo Labs' $6 million<\/a> seed raise.","The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/196252\/a16z-crypto-funds-still-have-billions-to-deploy-says-co-founder-chris-dixon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">majority<\/a> of a16z's most recent crypto fund is still to be deployed, said general partner and crypto fund founder Chris Dixon in a recent interview on The Block's podcast <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/amp\/post\/196118\/a16zs-chris-dixon-on-the-state-of-the-crypto-market-exclusive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Scoop<\/a>."],"hashtag":["SERIES A"]}
