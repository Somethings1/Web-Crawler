For any change to occur to the protocol, an AIP would have to be proposed, voted on, and approved by the Aave DAO,\u201D Aave added in a statement to The Block.","For context, AIP stands for Aave Improvement Proposals. AIPs are submitted to the Aave DAO governance for discussions and possible on-chain voting before being implemented on the protocol. Aave DAO is the decentralized autonomous organization that oversees the protocol.","The DeFi lender also clarified that the recent block on wallet addresses with indirect Tornado Cash interactions only occurred on its front-end app.","Several notable crypto personalities, including The Daily Gwei newsletter founder Anthony Sassano and Tron creator Justin Sun, reported that their wallet addresses were blocked on Aave. Both Sassano and Sun were among notable public figures whose wallets were involved in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162465\/crypto-notables-are-being-sent-eth-from-sanctioned-tornado-cash-wallets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tornado Cash \u201Cdusting\u201D inciden<\/a>t where someone sent 0.1 ETH to several publicly-known wallet addresses. This dusting incident was in response to the sanctions imposed on Tornado Cash by the US Treasury.","Aave quickly rectified the situation once news emerged that it was blocking access to its platforms for wallets with only indirect interaction with the sanctioned crypto mixer. The DeFi lender has since said the temporary blocklist happened due to a misconfiguration of the platform\u2019s TRM API integration. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/126602\/blockchain-forensics-outfit-trm-labs-secures-60-million-in-series-b-funding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TRM is a compliance solution<\/a> utilized by several crypto companies. Aave says it has corrected the misconfiguration and that its front-end should be accessible to previously blocked users who do not have any direct interactions with Tornado Cash.","Aave is not the first crypto app to block wallets from its front-end. Decentralized exchange platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/143036\/uniswap-labs-now-blocks-crypto-wallets-frontend\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Uniswap did so<\/a> in April, long before the Tornado Cash sanctions. The sanctioned mixer itself was also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/142081\/ethereum-mixer-tornado-cash-now-blocks-sanctioned-addresses\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blocking sanctioned addresses<\/a> from its front-end as early as well.","Â© 2023 The Block.
