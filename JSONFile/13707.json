Solana came in second place at 31%, with Avalanche (20.4%), Cosmos (13.3%) and Tezos (8%) making up the top five. Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Near, Polkadot, BNB Chain, Fantom and zkSync were also on their radar.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, interest in Ethereum fell from 96.4% in Immunefi\u2019s previous survey.

However, the majority (88.5%) also agreed that projects\u2019 security measures were improving.","Bounty size was cited as the main factor (66.4%) for whitehats when selecting bounty programs, though trust, scope and efficient communication were also highly valued.&nbsp;","After paying out over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/197424\/ethical-crypto-hackers-win-52-million-in-bug-bounties-via-immunefi-in-2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$52 million<\/a> in rewards to ethical hackers for finding vulnerabilities in web3 protocols last year, Immunefi has come to dominate crypto bug bounty rewards.
