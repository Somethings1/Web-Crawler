The company says that this decentralized internet of things model should result in increased accuracy of forecasts for areas that lack weather infrastructure.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe current weather data collection and forecasting model is mostly designed, funded and operated by governments,\" said WeatherXM CEO Manolis Nikiforakis in a statement. \"We all take advantage of it every day but it's far from perfect as data collection requirements are completely different per use-case and often government priorities are not aligned with people\u2019s needs.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","The project is in the early stages, currently in beta.
