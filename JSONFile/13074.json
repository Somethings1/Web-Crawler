At the same time, they have buoyed a bullish bitcoin-led market and revitalized the crypto industry. In fact, these days, it\u2019s hard to tell who\u2019s more bullish on bitcoin, MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor or BlackRock's Larry Fink.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe U.S. spot <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_positive\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      +0.70%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> ETFs have been widely successful well beyond even the most optimistic expectations,\u201D said GSR Research Analyst Brian Rudick to The Block. \u201CTheir $10 billion-plus of inflows in just two months is approaching what most thought they would do in the first year, and there are arguments for why inflows may increase from here, like greater issuer sales efforts, their addition to wealth manager product offerings, and normalizing GBTC outflows.\u201D<\/span>","\u201CThey have been nearly the sole driver pushing BTC's price from ~$25k to $70k, have been the most successful ETF launch in history by many measures, and perhaps most importantly, have legitimized and cemented digital assets as an asset class,\u201D he added.","Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas shared a similar view. \u201CFirst two months officially in the books (it's felt like six) and the ten bitcoin ETFs now have over $55 billion in assets with exactly double that in volume at $110 billion. If these were the numbers at the end of year I'd call them a success,\u201D he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EricBalchunas\/status\/1767156517449400449\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">posted on X<\/a>. \u201CTo do it in eight weeks is simply absurd.\u201D","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/spot-bitcoin-etf-aum-ex-gbtc-daily\/embed\" title=\"Spot Bitcoin ETF AUM ex-GBTC (Daily)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Balchunas added that BlackRock and Fidelity\u2019s ETFs rank third and fourth, respectively, in year-to-date flows among all ETFs in mid-March, sitting alongside some of the biggest ETFs in the world. He noted that this was not something he would have predicted.","Calling the spot bitcoin ETF launches of January \"a monumental success,\" Nate Geraci, president of investment advisor The ETF Store, said, \"These products have functioned flawlessly, trading with tight spreads and closely tracking the spot price of bitcoin. Add-in rock-bottom fees on the nine new ETFs and it\u2019s been a clear win for investors.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;","The ETFs have certainly hit some milestones. They\u2019ve pulled in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/spot-bitcoin-etf-onchain-holdings\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">additional 180,000 bitcoin<\/a> on top of the bitcoin that Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust held when it was converted to an ETF. In combination with the price rise, this has seen the value held in ETFs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/spot-bitcoin-etf-onchain-holdings-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">nearly double<\/a> from $28.9 billion on the first day to $56.6 billion just two months later.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/spot-bitcoin-etf-onchain-holdings-usd\/embed\" title=\"Spot Bitcoin ETF On-Chain Holdings (Daily)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Spot bitcoin ETFs now hold a total of 802,000 bitcoin.

He expected modest flows in the range of $50 million per day.","\u201CI think we're now at a point where we can say pretty definitively that my expectations were blown out of the water. Relative to GLD, daily net inflows on a relative (% of AUM or % of total inflows to date) and absolute basis has been extraordinarily strong,\u201D he said.&nbsp;","Johnsson added that he still views the emergence of the bitcoin ETF category as similar to the adoption of a GLD-like product but on a much faster timeline. \u201CWhereas it took GLD about a decade to saturate, spot BTC ETFs might do the same in far less time. Not to say there won't be dips\/outflows along the way, but it's really incredible what we've seen thus far,\u201D he said.","While the demand for bitcoin from the ETFs has pushed up bitcoin\u2019s price, this was aided by additional demand from Saylor\u2019s MicroStrategy. It recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281654\/microstrategy-bitcoin-205000-btc-blackrock\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">purchased 12,000 more bitcoin<\/a> for roughly $821.7 million in cash, increasing its total bitcoin holdings to 205,000. At the same time, bitcoin\u2019s market cap has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281605\/bitcoin-surpasses-silver-to-become-the-eighth-largest-asset-by-market-cap\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">overtaken that of silver<\/a>.","The ETFs have also captured <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/282002\/spot-bitcoin-etfs-market-share-futures-etfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">90% of the market share<\/a> between them and futures-based bitcoin ETFs, with BlackRock, Grayscale and Fidelity making up the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281742\/blackrock-and-fidelitys-spot-bitcoin-etfs-nab-69-of-market-share-eroding-grayscales-dominance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lion\u2019s share<\/a> of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281381\/spot-bitcoin-etf-cumulative-trading-volume-crosses-100-billion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cumulative $100 billion<\/a> of trading volume.

For instance, Vanguard is still <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/272049\/vanguard-wont-offer-spot-bitcoin-etfs-says-high-volatility-is-bad-for-generating-long-term-returns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">turning its nose up<\/a>&nbsp;at the products and said it has no plans to change its mind. But other platforms are not against the ETFs in principle; they&nbsp;just haven\u2019t listed them yet.","\"In the next month, we could see the larger wealth management platforms onboard the ETFs, opening up another sluice gate of capital,\u201D said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, a Kraken company and FCA-authorized indices provider used by several of the spot bitcoin ETFs.","\u201CThat some of these ETFs regularly see billion dollars in average trading volumes and have AuMs in excess of $10bn means they might also be sufficiently large and liquid to be considered by pension funds,\u201D Sui added. \u201COf course, that will be at the discretion and investment philosophy of the investment teams and trustees but most of these funds already own commodities so it\u2019s not inconceivable that they might use bitcoin to further diversify returns for plan holders.\"","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
