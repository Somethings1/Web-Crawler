This means the app could also support virtual goods such as loyalty reward points and equities. The possible inclusion of equity trading, a portal for merchants, and a wide array of other assets would make the app more similar to a traditional fintech product like PayPal than a crypto-native offering that allows retailers to accept bitcoin, like Flexa.&nbsp;","Thus far, Bakkt has been known for its institution-aimed products, which include Bitcoin futures and options. Bakkt also offers institutional custody services, which counts Galaxy Digital and Tagomi as clients.&nbsp;","Still, as The Block previously reported, the firm's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/51654\/with-ceo-appointment-bakkt-shows-commitment-to-consumer-ambitions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent CEO pick<\/a> shows the firm is just as serious (if not more serious) about its upcoming consumer offering. Bakkt&nbsp;named Mike Blandina as its new CEO at the end of last year, replacing Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed as a U.S. Senator from the state of Georgia.&nbsp;","Indeed, in an October blog post, Blandina said&nbsp;the firm was focused on building the consumer app and merchant portal, for which Starbucks is serving as a launch partner.","At the panel, White also commented on the general state of the crypto market, noting that a \"killer app\" has yet to come to fruition.&nbsp;","\"I do not think we are there yet,\" he said. \"What gives me optimism is that we are seeing a lot of developer interest. I am confident that someone is going to find something.\""],"hashtag":[]}
