The victim of the scam was tricked into forking over $400,000 to the scammers, who transferred the funds to other wallets that investigators then connected to funds from the other 36 victims.","The civil forfeiture action is a required step in the forfeiture process that allows third parties to make claims to the property before the funds can eventually be returned to the victims.","The USAO\u2019s action closely follows last week\u2019s news that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Chicago had seized $1.4 million in Tether from an unhosted virtual cryptocurrency wallet tied to a suspected tech support scam targeting the elderly.","Tether voluntarily assisted with the recovery of those assets, burning the funds tied to the alleged scammers and reissuing them in other, government-controlled wallets to be returned to the victims.","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"United States Attorney\u2019s Office","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$400,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"spring","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Chicago","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$2.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Massachusetts","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Pig Butchering","DOJ"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
