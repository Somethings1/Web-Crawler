There is a longstanding precedent in the U.S. of media organizations covering trials and other legal cases pressing for the release of as much information as possible, arguing public interest and First Amendment rights, without taking a side in the case. &nbsp;","In an Aug. 2 letter to Kaplan, David McCraw, the deputy general counsel for the Times, wrote that \u201Cany order limiting communication with the press necessarily requires a balancing of First Amendment rights and the need to assure a fair trial and effective administration of justice.\u201D","McCraw went on to argue that the recent legal fight over whether Bankman-Fried\u2019s participation in the Ellison profile \u201Coverlooks the public\u2019s legitimate interest \u2014independent of this prosecution \u2014 in Ms. Ellison and her activities at her cryptocurrency trading firm.\u201D","\u201CShe has confessed to being a central participant in a financial scheme that defrauded investors of billions of dollars \u2014 a scheme that was not detected by government regulators and law enforcement agencies until the public\u2019s money had disappeared,\u201D continued McCaw. \u201CIt is not surprising that the public wants to know more about who she is and what she did and that news organizations would seek to provide to the public timely, pertinent, and fairly reported information about her, as The Times did in its story.\u201D","On Friday a documentary production company working on a film about FTX and the criminal case \u2014 which Bankman-Fried was to give an interview this week \u2014 and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, a nonprofit, also urged Kaplan to modify his gag order and allow Bankman-Fried and others to continue to speak to reporters.","After the unusual amount of input, Kaplan late on Friday ordered another hearing on the topic. The judge will likely decide after that whether to put Bankman-Fried in jail pending trial, as well as whether to extend the temporary gag order through the criminal trial, due to begin Oct. 2.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
