The company also owes over $69 million in digital currency to its clients, but currently has about $68 million in digital assets.","\u201CAs such, Prime would be unable to satisfy all of its withdrawals,\u201D the Nevada regulator said.","According to the order, Prime contracted with Fireblocks, LLC, a digital asset security platform, in 2019 to store crypto. After the migration to Fireblocks, new management came in to Prime, and they were told all crypto was maintained and accessible on the Fireblocks platform, according to the regulator.","Later in January 2021, Prime reintroduced legacy wallet forwarding addresses to customers.","\u201CIt is understood Prime did so because of limitations associated with creating new wallets within the Fireblocks platform,\u201D the regulator said. \u201CPrime purportedly believed that these legacy wallets existed on the Fireblocks platform or were configured to forward to wallets accessible on the Fireblocks platform.\u201D","However, Prime then found out in December 2021 that it could not access those legacy wallets and the crypto in them, the regulator said.","Prime Trust's board of managers agreed to the receivership, according to an attachment to the regulator's filing.","(<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updates story with information from order.<\/em>)","Â© 2023 The Block.
