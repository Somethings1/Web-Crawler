Genesis and CoinDesk are part of the same parent company, Digital Currency Group.","An \u201Cunauthorized third party gained access to certain BlockFi client data housed on Kroll\u2019s platform,\u201D BlockFi said in a tweeted statement, and FTX said it was \u201Cclosely monitoring the situation.\u201D","While internal systems at both crypto firms are intact, the incident may have raised fears that the personal information could be used by malicious actors attempting to extract still juicier details such as seed phrases or passwords.","Kroll, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk, is a bankruptcy service provider for numerous companies, not just in the crypto sector. Kroll\u2019s website also promotes a cybersecurity consultancy service, involving \u201Celite cyber risk leaders uniquely positioned to deliver end-to-end cyber security services worldwide.\u201D","In a statement published on its sites for the FTX and Genesis bankruptcy cases, Kroll said the hack stemmed from a SIM-swapping attack against one of its employees. The hacker accessed online files including customers' names, addresses, email addresses and size of their claim, Kroll said.","FTX and BlockFi both filed for bankruptcy in November last year, after CoinDesk leaked details of FTX\u2019s balance sheet, and both are undergoing legal proceedings to wind up and restore funds to creditors. Earlier this week a Delaware court heard that legal fees are draining $1.5 million per day from the estate.","Read more: This Is How Scammers Can Drain Your Crypto Wallet","UPDATE (Aug. 25, 14.41 UTC): adds statement from Kroll website, confirms Genesis was affected throughout story.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"$1.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Aug. 25","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Delaware","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kroll","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kroll website","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kroll","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","FTX","BlockFi","Bankruptcy","Kroll"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
