The last time bitcoin\u2019s market cap dominance was this high was the week of Dec. 4, 2017.","A big bottoming candle was put in the past week on strong volume, implying some short term capitulation from sellers and strength from buyers.","The broader market structure is still questionable as we\u2019ve now experienced a 34% peak-to-trough down move from the YTD high of $13,868 down to last week\u2019s low of $9,071.","As I mentioned on <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/el2.convertkit-mail2.com\/c\/preview\/xwixor2zu6h8\/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9qb2VtY2Nhbm4vc3RhdHVzLzExNTE1MTk1MDA3NzQyMDMzOTM=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/el2.convertkit-mail2.com\/c\/preview\/xwixor2zu6h8\/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9qb2VtY2Nhbm4vc3RhdHVzLzExNTE1MTk1MDA3NzQyMDMzOTM=\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a>, bitcoin was due for a bounce as it breached the lower Bollinger Band (BB) and two out of the three major momentum indicators, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/w\/williamsr.asp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Williams %R<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/stochasticoscillator.asp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stochastic Oscillators<\/a>, were both oversold.","Immediate resistance is right back at the mid-point of the BB which is the 20 DMA.","Volatility fell off a cliff after the CFTC investigation news of BitMEX hit the wires. I don\u2019t expect it to last long.","A bullish MACD crossover appears to be in the making but it is too early to tell.","The current trading range is quite tight and rather straightforward: the 20-day moving average is acting as resistance while the 50-day moving average is offering up support. Which one gets breached first?","For the coming week, some traders are positioning themselves for some activity with the soft launch of Bakkt while others are focused on the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thetokenanalyst\/status\/1152473212900597760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thetokenanalyst\/status\/1152473212900597760\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">huge drop in wallet outflows<\/a> from BitMEX dragging down every exchange\u2019s volume with it. Volatility, while currently muted, is due to for a pop. Given the drop in volume and liquidity, expect a bumpy ride.","Good luck!"],"hashtag":[]}
