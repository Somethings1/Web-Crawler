The newly rolled out Manta Pacific, now in testnet, aims to serve as a layer 2 ecosystem to make it easier for developers to deploy Ethereum Virtual Machine-native ZK applications.","The new capital, valuing the project at $500 million, will help scale the network, user base and use cases for Manta Pacific and fuel the expansion in key Asia markets, according to a statement. Additional investors in the round included Alliance, CoinFund, and SevenX Ventures.","\u201CWe are excited to see Manta expanding into the Ethereum ecosystem, and have doubled down on our investment this Series A round,\u201D said Luke Pearson, Investor at Polychain Capital. \u201CManta Pacific will leverage the performance capabilities of the modular ecosystem, whilst also allowing increasing access to ZK through Universal Circuits,\u201D he added.","The raise comes as Web3 infrastructure has been an investor darling from the beginning of this year following last year's FTX implosion.
