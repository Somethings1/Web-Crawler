In other words, to promote self-regulation in crypto.","Per the Republican candidate, the group is often cited by regulators and legislators alike.","More recently, the group engaged with Senator Cynthia Lummis, who has recently introduced a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/151352\/after-months-of-hype-lummis-gillibrand-crypto-bill-is-more-media-event-than-law\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">long-awaited bill<\/a> (the Responsible Financial Innovation Act) clarifying a number of parameters regarding crypto regulation, including how much oversight different federal agencies should have. Notably, it states that \"digital assets that meet the definition of a commodity, such as bitcoin or ether,\" fall under the purview of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).","As the crypto industry deals with the fallout from events like the Terra crash and Celsius' freeze on all transfers, Bond commented on possible regulatory implications that might arise from these events.","\"I think stablecoins are sort of the low-hanging fruit. I expect that there is going to be a lot of policy-making that happens,\" she said. \"Disclosure is really like the key thing that people have been pointing to(...) Disclosure is not sporadic tweets.\"","To be clear, Bond said crypto is not the priority on her agenda as it pertains to her ambitions to take a seat in Congress. Instead, she is focused on representing what she believes are the interests of the people from her district (Suffolk), which skew mainly toward the economy.","\"My job in Congress would be very different actually from the job I have now. I would use my experience from the business world to inform my decisions,\" she said. \"(Crypto is) obviously a hot policy area. I think we're gonna see continued focus from Capitol Hill on that debate,\" she said."],"hashtag":["CONGRESS","SEC"]}
