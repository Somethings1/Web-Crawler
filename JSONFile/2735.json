The TIA token is used by validators for staking to secure the network.","MilkTIA represents the staked TIA assets while preserving their liquidity. Users can trade or use these assets as collateral across various decentralized finance (DeFi) products. This arrangement bypasses the typical 21-day unbonding period common in Cosmos-based blockchains.","MilkyWay operates without relying on a dedicated Layer 1 blockchain.
