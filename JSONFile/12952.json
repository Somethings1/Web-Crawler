Paradigm previously led StarkWare's $30 million fundraise in 2018.<\/span>","\"StarkWare is emblematic of companies with which Paradigm seeks to partner: a world class team tackling an extremely important problem with stunning growth,\" commented Paradigm's Matt Huang. \"We are excited to double down and help them scale DeFi, NFTs and Ethereum more&nbsp;broadly.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Previous investors, including Sequoia, Founders Fund, and Pantera participated in the round alongside new investors like Three Arrows and Alameda Research.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The fresh funding comes on the heels of a period of growth, with headcount doubling in 2020 and demand for its services soaring \u201Cby every conceivable metric,\u201D according to Uri Kolodny and Eli Ben-Sasson, who founded the firm with Michael Riabzev and Alessandro Chiesa.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThat stands to reason, given the market backdrop. As ether and other digital assets climbed to new heights, the Ethereum network itself has hit a scaling roadblock. This state of affairs has made it increasingly more expensive to transact on Ethereum, with the average transaction fee on Ethereum climbing above $18 this week compared to the roughly $0.08 it cost at the beginning of 2020.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/ethereum\/average-transaction-fee-on-ethereum\/embed\" title=\"Average Transaction Fee on Ethereum (7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","StarkWare\u2019s Cairo is a service that leverages cryptography to boost transaction throughput by moving much of the heavy computational work off-chain without compromising the network\u2019s security.
