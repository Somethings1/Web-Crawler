Control over those bank accounts would then be given to Gao, Xu and Jiang, prosecutors said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The three people and others involved in the scheme then arranged for the funds to be deposited and transferred between bank accounts controlled by people connected to the scheme. Then Gao, Xu, Jiang and others \"<\/span><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">would cause fraudulent reports to be filed with the banks claiming that these wire transfers were unauthorized,\" prosecutors said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"This prompted the banks \u2014 both the bank issuing the wire transfer and the bank receiving the wire transfer \u2014 to temporarily credit the accounts in the amount of the transferred funds, effectively doubling the amount of money initially deposited into these accounts, even though Gao, Xu, Jiang, and other members of the scheme had in fact authorized the transfers and maintained control over the transferred funds all along,\" the U.S. Attorney's office said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Afterwards, they would organize those funds to be withdrawn quickly as cash or into crypto and moved onto foreign crypto exchanges before the banks realized the reports were fake.
