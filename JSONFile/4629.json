The team further made the case that if the on-chain liquidation went through, Solend would be at risk of accruing bad debt due to a cascading drop in SOL's value.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The team suggested that rather than a protocol liquidation, the loan should be wound up via an over the counter (OTC) deal. The Solend governance system then hurriedly passed a vote that gave the team full power to confiscate the user's position. In this vote, 88% of the voting power came from a single address.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Later on social media, the governance decision received a lot of criticism from many commentators who berated the team for undermining the ethos of decentralization.
