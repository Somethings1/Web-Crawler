Stepn saw its own decline in user in April when the price of GMT, the game\u2019s second in-game currency, fell 80%, reducing with it the game\u2019s monthly users from 700,000 to less than 100,000, Azmi writes. Thus, maintaining stable prices for GMT and GST were crucial.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Throughout the year, though, Stepn implemented ways to regulate the token supply such as through token buy back and burns that reduced the amount of GMT in July, helping to make its gaming ecosystem more sustainable. <\/span>"],"hashtag":["SOLANA"]}
