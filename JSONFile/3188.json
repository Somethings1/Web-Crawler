While the exchange was struggling for most of 2019 to rise above 1% market share, after the spinoff its market share hit 2% for the first time in the past several months. It is likely that the rise is due to Poloniex's new zero trading fee program, which the exchange implemented after it left Circle.","",""],"hashtag":["JUSTIN SUN"]}
