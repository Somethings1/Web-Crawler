Aside from the amount of time a legal analysis could take, staff has to present commissioners its recommendations, and the bipartisan commission votes on whether to proceed with litigation. The current commission has three Democrats and two Republicans, meaning if Gensler and staff want to appeal the portion of the ruling that went against the commission, they likely can convince a majority of the commission to do so.&nbsp;","Ripple may also appeal since its executives could be found liable for playing a part in the illegal sale of securities. Judge Analisa Torres, of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York, ruled that over $700 million worth of XRP sales to institutional investors broke securities laws, but that other XRP sales did not.&nbsp;","An appeal of Torres's ruling from either side would go to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
