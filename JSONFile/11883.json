As a first-of-its-kind scalable cross-chain protocol on the TRON network, BTTC employs a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism leveraging various sidechains for the scaling of smart contracts. BTTC is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible and allows for interoperability between blockchains like Ethereum, TRON, and BNB Chain. This allows for seamless exchange of assets and enhances connectivity within the DeFi ecosystem. Central to the BTTC ecosystem, the BitTorrent Token (BTT) plays a crucial role in incentivizing network participation and content sharing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Key events of 2023<\/b>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">February 14<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> -&nbsp; SushiSwap launches new yield farms on BTTC<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">April 12<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> -&nbsp; SWFT AllChain Bridge supports BTTC<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">July 12<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> -&nbsp; BTT utility token listed on Bittrex Global<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">July 14<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> -&nbsp; MDEX deploys BTTC<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">November 9<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> -&nbsp; \u201CChain switcher\u201D for BTTC goes live on SpookySwap<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">December 15<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> - Pyth Network supports BTTC<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Conclusion<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As a world-leading blockchain scaling solution, BTTC provides cross-chain services between various public blockchains, providing a faster, cheaper, and more scalable platform for Web3 developers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BTTC also enables users to transfer mainstream assets seamlessly among TRON, Ethereum, and BNB Chain without any limitations in a decentralized manner.
