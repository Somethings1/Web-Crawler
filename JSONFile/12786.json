Kwon has been in a jail in Montenegro for months on charges of document forgery.","The extradition is sought for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264599\/do-kwon-extradition-approved\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">charges related<\/a> to financial crimes. Kwon previously agreed to be extradited to South Korea, but Milovic was expected to make the final decision on which country would take precedence.","Milovic has not yet announced his decision and may wait for the country\u2019s courts to rule on a last-ditch appeal by Kwon against the court ruling, the WSJ said.","The U.S. has made headlines in recent months first for prosecuting former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and then most recently charging Binance's Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao for anti-money laundering and sanctions violations.
