His firm has so far sold only once: A 708 bitcoin sale in December 2022, worth $11 million at the time.","The company's most recent publicly known purchases were in the weeks ahead of Sept. 24 of this year when it added 5,445 bitcoins for just under $150 million, or an average price of $27,053 each. That brought MicroStrategy's holdings to 158,245 bitcoins acquired at an aggregate purchase price of roughly $4.68 billion, or an average price of $29,582 each.","At the current price of $30,650, the bitcoin bet is in the green by about $1,000 per coin, for a total gain of roughly $160 million.","The firm's holdings of 158,245 bitcoins is nearly 14 times that of the next nearest institutional holder, data from Bitcoin Treasuries show.","And MicroStrategy might be buying even more. The company in August said it may raise up to $750 million by selling more stock, with plans to use some of the proceeds to purchase bitcoin.","Edited by Stephen Alpher.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"$160 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Stephen Alpher","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$29,582","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$11 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$30,650","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4.68 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$750 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"$31,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sept. 24","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"MicroStrategy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$27,053","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$150 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","MicroStrategy","Michael Saylor"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
