The pass will also <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/babylonchain-io\/join-the-bitcoin-staking-revolution-5558ad66f5ef\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">grant<\/a> access to some \"exclusive\" unspecified features.","\"This testnet launch provides a practical demonstration of how bitcoin can be staked to secure PoS [proof-of-stake] chains,\" Jehan Tremback, from the Cosmos Hub team at Informal Systems, said in a statement. \"We are following it with great interest, and we can't wait to integrate Babylon into the products that we build.\"","Babylon is already in the process of supporting the Cosmos Hub ecosystem, as The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/215662\/babylon-to-bring-bitcoin-security-to-chains-in-the-cosmos-ecosystem\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> previously. The Babylon protocol will help BTC become a staking asset on PoS networks, using its security to make PoS chains safer. Currently, PoS chains rely on their native tokens for security, which can be expensive, especially for newer chains that often need to offer high staking rewards to attract capital. With Babylon, users will eventually be able to stake their real bitcoins on PoS and earn rewards.","Babylon is backed by high-profile investors, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/279344\/binance-labs-bitcoin-staking-protocol-babylon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance Labs<\/a>, Polygon Ventures, OKX Ventures and Polychain Capital. The project has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266518\/bitcoin-staking-babylon-series-a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> over $26.8 million in total funding to date.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
