The SEC rejected Grayscale's request to convert its flagship GBTC fund into an ETF in late June, and the company has argued the refusal harms its 850,000 investors who already own shares in the trust.","In the 73-page <a href=\"https:\/\/grayscale.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Reply-Brief-of-Respondent-SEC-12092022.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">response brief<\/a>, the SEC argued its rejection was \"reasonable, reasonably explained, supported by substantial evidence,\" with \"no inconsistency in the Commission\u2019s disapproval of Grayscale\u2019s spot ETP despite having approved two CME bitcoin futures ETPs.\"","The SEC said futures and spot-based bitcoin funds are \"fundamentally different products.","\"The Commission previously approved ETPs that hold only futures contracts that trade on the CME, which is registered with the CFTC; those ETPs\u2019 underlying assets are thus subject to robust surveillance,\" it said. \"The bitcoin spot market, by contrast, is fragmented and unregulated, and petitioner presented no supportable basis to conclude that the CME\u2019s surveillance of futures trading would sufficiently detect and deter fraud and manipulation targeting the bitcoin spot market and thereby protect against fraud and manipulation in Grayscale\u2019s product.\"","The SEC said its disapproval of Greyscale's proposed ETF did not reflect an \"impermissible, merits-based<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nskepticism of bitcoin as an investment.''","In response to the SEC filing, Grayscale reiterated its arguments from its opening brief and accused the SEC of \"creating an uneven playing field for investors by approving Bitcoin futures-based ETFs, while continuously denying spot Bitcoin ETFs.\"","\"We look forward to reviewing the SEC\u2019s reply brief,\" the company said, noting that its next brief is due Jan. 13 before final briefs are due on Feb. 3.","The price of GBTC versus the bitcoin it actually holds hit an all-time low on Wednesday, with the discount ratio reaching 47.3%, according to data from The Block. The fund trades at a discount to the net asset value, as shares don't grant the holder access to the underlying assets.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
