According to a press release, they can expect interest on the value of that bitcoin to be calculated \u201Cevery second,\u201D and interest will then be added to their balance each week. Customers can buy and sell the bitcoin in the account instantly with no penalties, according to Ziglu\u2019s press release.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To understand whether an interest rate \u2014 be it 5% or 20% \u2014 is fair, investors must understand what level of risk they are taking on. This is as true for crypto lending as it is with more traditional peer-to-peer platforms. How is the company offering 5% interest generating enough yield to deliver that rate (while, presumably, keeping something for itself)? What protections does the investor have if something goes wrong?<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mark Hipperson, founder and CEO of the company, told The Block that Ziglu partners with \u201Cleading cryptocurrency lending platforms\u201D which lend on the bitcoin that Boost users deposit.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis generates a return, which we then pass back to our customers.
