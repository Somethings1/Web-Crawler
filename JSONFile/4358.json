If you\u2019d still like to invest in crypto assets, you can try using a different bank or provider instead \u2014 but please be cautious, as you may not be able to get the money back if the payment ends up being related to a fraud or scam,\" the email stated.","\"We\u2019ve made this decision because fraudsters are increasingly using crypto assets to steal large sums of money from people. Declining these payments is one of the ways we're helping keep you and your money safe,\" it added.","Data from the UK's fraud reporting agency Action Fraud shows <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/88602223-004b-4e27-b9eb-c45e1f850f9f\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">UK consumer losses due to crypto fraud<\/a> increased by over 40% in the last year, surpassing £300 million ($365 million).","Chase isn't the only UK bank to take such measures, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/110818\/santander-uk-block-payments-binance-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Santander<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/110510\/barclays-customers-in-the-u-k-can-no-longer-transfer-funds-to-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Barclays<\/a> previously imposing restrictions on certain crypto-related transactions.
