At Makara, we think the same approach applies to crypto. We have all seen what Bitcoin can do, and we\u2019re not about to discount it going forward. But in the digital asset race, we believe there is room for more than one winner. Quite a few of them, actually.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In little more than a decade, blockchain technology has grown from a single digital asset into a burgeoning macrocosm of financial innovation. From an investor <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">perspective, the past four years have been volatile, and new entrants offered enormous opportunity with equally massive risk. Up until recently, the safe bet was Bitcoin. Yes, there are still Bitcoin purists who cling to the dogma of holding the original crypto at all costs. They consider this required fealty and are willing to take on anyone who questions their faith on social media. But for the rest of us\u2014 especially those of us who are interested in making money\u2014there is much more than just Bitcoin that belongs in a digital asset portfolio.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s a matter of choice. Aside from new investors, who may want to be told exactly what to invest in and avoid the stress of choosing themselves, most of us feel stifled without options. This is even more true in the world of crypto. As investors, we don\u2019t want to do exactly what other people are doing. We want to do what we think is best.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Every day there are new digital assets making their debut into the world, and not many of them take the simple store-of-value approach that Bitcoin does. There are new currencies, protocol tokens, decentralized finance, NFTs, and more. And while not all of them are worth your money, it would be unwise to dismiss them just because they\u2019re new. Investing in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin also helps to diversify your risk. Diversifying your investments has long been a principle in the traditional market, and we think it\u2019s also wise with crypto.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto is not a zero-sum game. There will be many winners, and while you can try to pick the biggest one, we believe you\u2019ll be much better off if you spread your exposure over multiple contenders. But with the thousands of cryptocurrencies and digital assets flooding the market, how do you separate the ones with promise from the ones with no future? That\u2019s where <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Makara<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> comes in.
