Jeffrey Kirt left his role atop the Bitcoin mining company, with two executives from forestry products company Millar Western replacing him.","Kirt, the loss-making miner's chief executive since March of last year, left the company today. He will be replaced by David Anderson, who most recently was CEO of Millar Western. Scott MacKenzie, currently Millar Western's vice president of corporate development, will be Greenidge's chief strategy officer. Both begin their roles at Greenidge on Oct. 8.","\"We've become a public company, strengthened our management team and workforce, significantly improved our fleet efficiency, expanded our geographic footprint and identified several new opportunities for strategic growth,\" Kirt said in a statement.","\"I am pleased to pass the baton now to Dave and Scott, whose extensive experience in successfully running and improving commodities businesses, executing capital projects and delivering reliable, low-cost power generation will serve Greenidge well.\"","Greenidge <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/117546\/bitcoin-mining-firm-greenidge-expects-public-nasdaq-listing-on-september-15\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">listed<\/a> on the NASDAQ exchange in September 2021.
