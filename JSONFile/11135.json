Worldcoin has also come under the microscope for giving out WLD tokens to people who sign up, many of whom reside in less-developed nations.<\/span>","The WLD token's price has more than doubled since the beginning of this year.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Previous to the rollout of World ID 2.0 and personal custody, people signing up for Worldcoin had two options: either to have their biometric data immediately deleted by the orb after being verified as human or, with the \"Data Custody\" option, users could allow the project to encrypt and store their private biometric details in \"<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">secure data stores.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Data Custody will no longer be offered at the time of your orb visit,\" Worldcoin said in a statement. Now, \u201Cthe information (images, metadata and derived data) generated at the orb and used to generate the iris code during World ID verification\" will be held on peoples\u2019 personal devices, instead of temporarily on orbs or permanently in data stores.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"This approach gives [users] control over the flow of this data, not just deletion, but any future use prior to being deleted.
