EVM, which stands for the Ethereum Virtual Machine, is a software environment on blockchains such as Ethereum and Evmos, responsible for processing and executing software logic within smart contracts.","Evmos operates an EVM-compatible <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/143771\/evmos-launches-blockchain-to-bring-ethereum-virtual-machine-to-cosmos\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blockchain<\/a> that supports decentralized applications from the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems, which presents distinctive challenges in maintaining compatibility between the two. While ERC-20 is the EVM standard, most chains in the Cosmos ecosystem use a different format for native assets, containing only denomination and amount information, and lacking token metadata that's present with ERC-20 tokens.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The core development firm noted that the absence of native ERC-20 support for Cosmos tokens has been an issue for client software and developers on Evmos, which it now plans to address.&nbsp;<\/span>","This will be implemented for Cosmos assets on Evmos using a planned software module called \"ERC-20 Extension.\" This module will consolidate ERC-20 and native Cosmos token formats on Evmos into a single standardized interface to simplify interactions for developers. The feature will be rolled out soon on the Evmos testnet with mainnet launch expected by the end of the year.&nbsp;","Just recently, Evmos <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/261855\/evmos-plans-to-deprecate-cosmos-transactions-signals-ethereum-alignment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> plans to phase out specific Cosmos infrastructure tools in favor of Ethereum or EVM-compatible ones like MetaMask. However, since Evmos is a Cosmos-based network, support for Cosmos code will persist to facilitate application functionality through specialized code modules called EVM Extensions. The team noted that the ERC-20 Extension will augment its EVM-only transition.","Kunze Küllmer said that Evmos ERC-20 Extension will allow the use of Cosmos native assets across all EVM wallets without extra steps or asset conversion processes, offering a straightforward one-step onboarding to Cosmos via popular wallets, including MetaMask.","Previously, Evmos <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/182223\/evmos-developers-raise-27-million-in-a-token-sale-led-by-polychain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> $27 million in a funding round led by Polychain Capital, though the valuation was not disclosed.","© 2023 The Block.
