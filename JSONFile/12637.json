Perkins did not comment on the firm\u2019s valuation with the round. The previous funding round was backed by Coinbase Ventures and Nirvana Capital, among others, to develop the Gods Unchained game.","The game is now being led by Chris Clay, the former director of popular video game \u201CMagic The Gathering (MTG): Arena.\u201D Clay was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/35202\/former-magic-the-gathering-arena-game-director-joins-blockchain-card-game-gods-unchained\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hired<\/a> by Immutable last month to lead the game\u2019s development, including design improvements and optimizing the overall community experience.","The firm wants to make blockchain gaming mainstream with the new capital. \u201CWe\u2019re developing an array of applications to provide a \u2018noob-proof\u2019 experience for users to jump in and easily interact with this new digital asset class,\u201D Perkins told The Block.","To that end, Immutable is also looking to hire \u201Croughly 30 more [people] over the next 3-6 months,\u201D in addition to its current headcount of around 50 people, said Perkins.","Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Gods Unchained has been in beta mode since July, and claims to have already sold more than 4 million cards, generating over $4.5 million in revenue through its limited \u201CGenesis Sale,\u201D which ends on Oct. 10.","Earlier this year, the firm <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.godsunchained.com\/2019\/02\/11\/the-62000-card\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sold<\/a> a card dubbed \u201CHyperion\u201D for about $62,000, claiming to be the second most-valuable game card in the world, followed by the MTG's \"Black Lotus\" card for $87,000 and its \"Alpha Black Lotus\" card for $27,000.","It is interesting to note Galaxy Digital EOS VC Fund's investment in the Ethereum-based gaming startup. \u201CTrue ownership of digital objects reflects the next paradigm for interactive content by aligning the long-term incentives of publishers, developers, creators, and players. We\u2019re investing broadly in the studios that are best executing on this vision across a variety of video game genres,\u201D Sam Englebardt, co-founder and co-head of principal investments at Galaxy Digital, said in the announcement.","Perkins told The Block \u201CWe don\u2019t believe there will be one blockchain to rule them all. Our intention for the Immutable Platform is to serve as an overlay that supports multiple protocols, allowing game developers to choose the one which works best for them.\u201D","In a similar development last year, blockchain gaming startup Mythical Games <a href=\"https:\/\/in.finance.yahoo.com\/news\/activision-alums-raise-16-million-233549993.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> $16 million to build an EOS-focused blockchain game studio.
