However, users can still redeem the tokens as usual for at least the next 12 months and can also swap them for USDT on other chains via platforms like Bitfinex, Tether noted.","Omni was the first layer that Tether used in 2014, enabling it to issue stablecoins on the Bitcoin blockchain. While USDT usage on Omni has dwindled in recent years given the availability of the stablecoin on other blockchains, Tether said it remained open to revisiting the idea of issuing USDT on Bitcoin via Omni if there was a surge in the Omni Layer's decentralized exchange and token issuance protocol usage.","Tether said it was also actively contributing to RGB \u2014 a smart contracts system operating on Bitcoin's Layer 2 and 3 \u2014 and would return to issuing the stablecoin on Bitcoin once USDT on RGB goes live.","The Ethereum and Tron blockchain networks currently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/usdt-supply-by-blockchain-daily\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dominate<\/a> USDT supply, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/stablecoins\/usd-pegged\/usdt-supply-by-blockchain-daily\/embed\" title=\"USDT Supply by Blockchain\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Tether is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization at $83 billion, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/tether\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to CoinGecko data."],"hashtag":["TETHER"]}
