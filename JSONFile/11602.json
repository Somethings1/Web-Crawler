However, due to the presence of an existing project named Bonsai.xyz , the moniker was quickly changed to Momoka.","RISC Zero, a blockchain research and development firm, owns the Bonsai trademark. At the ETHDenver event earlier this year, RISC Zero <a href=\"https:\/\/www.risczero.com\/blog\/ethdenver\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced Bonsai<\/a>, which is a zero-knowledge-based protocol being developed to enhance the computational capacity of blockchains.&nbsp;","A Lens Protocol representative said the swift transition to the alternative name, Momoka, was a proactive measure to avoid unnecessary brand complications in the future. They added that the effort was made to ensure the name wasn't trademarked, acting promptly upon realizing the pre-existing use of the name within the sector.","Lens Protocol aims to achieve censorship resistance for social media apps and help them unlock new forms of content monetization. To help such apps scale, Momoka will optimize cost and scalability by storing transactions off-chain in such a way as they remain accessible and verifiable. This can avoid the limitations of block space on Ethereum and other blockchains.","Momoka will process most transactions off-chain, relying on its data-availability layer. Data availability is essential for scaling solutions because it ensures that off-chain data remains accessible and verifiable when needed for on-chain settlement, dispute resolution or audits.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This article has been updated with information on the Bonsai trademark being owned by RISC Zero.<\/em>","© 2023 The Block.
