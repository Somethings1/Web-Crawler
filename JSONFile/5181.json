That means he's bought between $5,000 and $75,000 in total.","Aside from the misspelling of the words Ethereum \u2014 and, indeed, \"cryto,\" \u2014 the presence of cardano on the balance sheet suggests that he was buying on a crypto exchange, as ADA is not available on more mainstream trading platforms with crypto options, like Robinhood or PayPal.&nbsp;","But so far, Moore's trading has not played out in his favor. <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/cardano\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ADA<\/a> was between $1.65-$1.90 on the days he was buying, but has since fallen to $1.41 as of publication. <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/ethereum\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ETH<\/a> went from around $3,000 on the day of Moore's purchase to a peak of around $4,330 on May 13.
