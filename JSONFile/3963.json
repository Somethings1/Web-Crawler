According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/data\/decentralized-finance\/cryptocurrency-lending\/compound-lending-rates\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block research<\/a>, the supply rate for USDT on Compound is at 2.07% compared to a high of 10.5% in December last year.&nbsp;","Despite these conditions, Frambot says Morpho can weather the market.","\"Morpho strangely fits the bear market conditions because it's about native APY [annual percentage yield] improvements,\" said Frambot in an interview. \"The bear market is kind of better for us as although we might only be doing a 1% improvement of your APY, that really matters now that yields are down.\"&nbsp;","While he recognizes that the demand is falling for DeFi lending, he said that the demand for a product like Morpho is as much as there is demand for the Ethereum lending protocol Compound, which Morpho is built on top of.","Compound's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/data\/decentralized-finance\/total-value-locked-tvl\/total-value-locked-in-lending\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">total value locked<\/a>, an indicator of the adoption scale by calculating the value of tokens locked, is currently at $2.7 billion compared to $9.1 billion at the end of last year, according to The Block research.&nbsp;","Yet as an improvement layer for existing protocols, Morpho is not tied to one specific lending protocol. It's currently looking at ways of integrating Aave and adding a corresponding blockchain network.&nbsp;","It has also made steps to decentralize the protocol \u2013 part of the reason it chose two co-leads rather than one \u2014 by distributing non-transferable governance tokens to its users. These will have checkpoints, termed epochs and ages, where users can claim rewards and vote to refine the model of the protocol.&nbsp;","The funding news follows recent venture capital moves in the DeFi lending space despite increased pressure on the space. Last month, Sequoia Capital India and Quona Capital <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/155068\/sequoia-and-quona-lead-6-million-seed-round-for-defi-protocol-mohash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">co-led<\/a> a $6 million seed round for lending protocol MoHash.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
