The tweet appears to indicate that accounts with blue checks will now feature more prominently in users\u2019 Twitter feeds \u2014 and thus likely gain more followers and engagement than those without.","Musk\u2019s program \u2014 in which people who pay $8 per month a rewarded with a blue check next to their name on Twitter \u2014 is controversial. The blue check previously indicated that Twitter had independently verified a users\u2019 identity and that the user had some experience or authority in their field or profession. Under Musk\u2019s new plan, anyone can buy one.","In addition, Musk appears to have given out some blue checks for free to celebrity accounts or handles with large followings even if they did not want it.","","","So, how does this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/209950\/crypto-twitter-pokes-fun-at-twitter-on-twitter-amid-reports-of-problems\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rearrange Crypto Twitter<\/a>?
