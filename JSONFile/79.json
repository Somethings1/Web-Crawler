The community can then proceed to vote on them, offer new inputs, or propose alternative processes.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It could take years before the Maker Foundation completely dissolves, Christensen said. Before that, the foundation will facilitate and oversee the governance design and knowledge transfer process to ensure that its eventual dissolution will not have a negative impact on the system\u2019s performance.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The new, community-based governance system will feature elected paid contributors (EPCs) and domain teams. They will function as the ecosystem\u2019s \u201Cpublic servants,\u201D offering expertise ranging from security maintenance to the protocol\u2019s long-run development. A protocol will be in place to elect and pay them.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Domain teams, as a subset of EPCs, will hold special authority over certain processes depending on their specialty. For instance, the risk team will have authority over the risk management process and will offer sanity checks for relevant proposals before the community votes on them.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While risk management constitutes the most crucial work, Christensen said, there could be a wide range of work delegated to EPCs including marketing, human resources, and legal research. But the community would have to decide the exact structure and responsibilities of EPCs later on through formal proposals.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Christensen also added that it is crucial to first transfer the foundation\u2019s technical knowledge to the EPCs before the former can safely dissolve.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Following the design of many other decentralized communities, the Maker Foundation proposed using Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) as a formal process to decide and revise the system\u2019s governance paradigm. These MIPs will dictate the system\u2019s day-to-day operation from overall governance design to engineering.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MIPs will be especially important in the short run, Christensen said, since the community needs to agree upon the initial design of all processes. With risk management, for example, relevant MIPs will first need to be put in place before the responsible domain team can come in and build the risk construct.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As a starting point, the Maker Foundation will publish an initial set of 13 MIPs for the community to review. These MIPs, set to be published on April 6, will cover the overall core governance framework as well as the collateral onboarding process.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Speaking to the potential politicization of the proposal-making process, which, within the context of ProgPow, has emerged as a problem within the Ethereum community, Christensen contended that politicization is inevitable and the community has to use the system\u2019s \u201Ccheck-and-balances\u201D to deter polarizing behaviors.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf Maker becomes a global actor, it is unavoidable that there will be a lot of political proxy wars of public figures fighting against each other for influence,\u201D he said. \u201CThat dynamic is always gonna happen. We just need a system that is resilient enough to deal with these non-optimal behaviors.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Christensen, the main difference between MIPs and other processes like Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIPs) lies in the former\u2019s emphasis on organization and structure. While EIPs and BIPs almost exclusively focus on technical implementation, MIPs\u2019 main purpose is to standardize governance processes. This early emphasis on governance, he said, could also mitigate the politicization problem and allow the community to bootstrap a constructive political climate from the start.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWith EIPs, where politicization is an issue, the governance aspect wasn\u2019t considered at the very beginning,\u201D said Christensen. \u201CWith Maker, governance is the defining concept from this very moment.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the EPCs are the \u201Cpublic servants\u201D in the new system, vote delegates will act as the \u201Cpoliticians\u201D making decisions on behalf of community members who have delegated their MKR to them.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vote delegates can be self-identified and chosen independently by voters. According to Christensen, their roles are crucial to making sure that the community can effectively keep MIPs and EPCs in check.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CVote delegates serve as a bridge between voting and public discussion, ultimately bringing governance to a healthy state where decisions are made based on publicly available reasoning,\u201D he said in the presentation. <\/span>"],"hashtag":["DAI"]}
