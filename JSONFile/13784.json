The two firms filed with the SEC last June to list the fund on Cboe Global Markets, one of the markets behind bitcoin futures in the U.S. Most recently, the&nbsp;SEC extended the comment period for the fund on December 6 and the market has been waiting for regulators to give the fund the green light to trade.&nbsp;","The SEC has shot down a number of crypto ETFs, citing fear of manipulation of exchanges trading spot bitcoin as well as a lack of liquidity in bitcoin markets.","In addition to VanEck, Bitwise has been looking to launch a fund tied to bitcoin. The asset manager filed its own Form S-1 with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/01\/10\/bitwise-files-to-list-bitcoin-etf-on-nyse-arca\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month<\/a>.","It is not exactly clear why the application was pulled.&nbsp;The bitcoin ETF has been a long-awaited darling of the cryptocurrency world, and a derivative some think could propel the market out of the doldrums and into bullish territory.","Gabor Gurbacs, Director of Digital Assets Strategy at VanEck, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gaborgurbacs\/status\/1088173233722089486\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said in a tweet<\/a> that the firm would continue to try to get approval for an ETF. He said:&nbsp;\"The Bitcoin ETF filing has been temporarily withdrawn. We are actively working with regulators and major market participants to build appropriate market structure frameworks for a Bitcoin ETF and digital assets in general. Will keep you updated.\"","In an interview with CNBC, VanEck CEO Jan VanEck said that the firm pulled the application because of the government shutdown.&nbsp;","\"We will refile when the SEC gets going,\" he told Bob Pisani on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/video\/2019\/01\/23\/etf-edge-show-january-23-2019.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CNBC's ETF show<\/a>.
