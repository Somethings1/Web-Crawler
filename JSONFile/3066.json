It was worth more than double that in February of this year after a sudden spike in its share price.","Boatman bases its dilution claims on publicly available information that suggests that the number of Argo shares in circulation has risen from 307,905,000 at the start of the year to&nbsp;468,082,335 today.","Boatman\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/business\/2021\/08\/10\/london-bitcoin-miner-hit-attack-short-seller-boatman-capital\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">first report<\/a> on Argo focused on the company\u2019s $17.5 million purchase of a plot of land in Texas. Boatman concluded that Argo had paid more than 100 times the value of the land, but Argo\u2019s CEO Peter Wall defended the move, calling it \u201Ca very solid deal\u201D and a \u201Cproject acquisition.\u201D","The $1.5-2 billion in potential build-out costs for the Texas facility came to light in November when Argo was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/123386\/argo-filing-reveals-texas-mining-facility-could-cost-up-to-2-billion-to-build\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">forced to disclose inside information<\/a> that had mistakenly been published on Twitter by a fund manager who met with Argo executives.","A spokesperson for Argo Blockchain declined to comment on the latest Boatman report but pointed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/ArgoBlockchain\/videos?app=desktop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">videos posted on YouTube last week<\/a>&nbsp;in which Wall fielded questions about the business.","Wall said he doesn't believe that there will be delays with the Texas facility, which is scheduled to be up and running in March, and confirmed that construction costs would likely top $1 billion in total. With Argo now listed on Nasdaq, Wall said the focus is entirely on execution and mining as much bitcoin as possible.","Argo has been busy since Boatman\u2019s first report was published in August. In September, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/investegate.co.uk\/argo-blockchain-plc\/rns\/closing-of-offering\/202109271800531288N\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised roughly $128 million<\/a> (before deducting underwriting costs) through an American Depositary Shares offering on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States. Argo\u2019s shares have traded on the main market of the London Stock Exchange since 2018.","The firm has also taken on debt. In September, Argo expanded a bitcoin-backed loan facility provided by Galaxy Digital <a href=\"https:\/\/investegate.co.uk\/argo-blockchain-plc\/rns\/bitcoin-backed-loan-agreement\/202109100700053378L\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">from $25 million to $45 million<\/a>. A few months later, the company announced that it <a href=\"https:\/\/investegate.co.uk\/argo-blockchain-plc\/rns\/closing-of-8.75--senior-notes-due-2026-offering\/202111180700047565S\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">had secured another $40 million<\/a> through the issuance of bonds with an 8.75% coupon. In its latest report, Boatman states that the 8.75% interest rate places the bond \u201Cfirmly in \u2018junk\u2019 territory\u201D and points out that the proceeds fell short of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/123613\/argo-blockchain-hopes-to-raise-57-5-million-for-texas-mining-facility-via-public-offering\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the $57.5 million target<\/a>.","\u201CThe bond market has given its verdict on Argo Blockchain and it does not look good: even with a high interest rate as enticement, Argo could only raise two-thirds of its target amount,\u201D the report states.","The latest Boatman report also drew attention to equity investments that Argo has made in other crypto businesses \u2014 such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/102168\/crypto-investment-pluto-digital-assets-listing-aquis\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pluto<\/a> and GPUone \u2014 and to the short terms served by several of the company\u2019s board members. Colleen Sullivan, former CEO of crypto trading firm CMT Digital, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/123512\/colleen-sullivan-quits-argo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">resigned<\/a> after three months as a non-executive director at Argo, after taking a job at Brevan Howard that precluded her from holding board positions elsewhere.","\u201CGiven the litany of problems outlined above, we believe it is essential for Argo to bring in a strong chairman and directors who will stick around for more than a few months,\u201D the report concluded.","In the Q&amp;A videos posted last week, Wall said Argo is&nbsp;\u201Cin the process of looking for a new chairman\u201D but would not put a timeframe on the search."],"hashtag":[]}
