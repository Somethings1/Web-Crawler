Users can connect as many crypto wallets as they want to the company\u2019s platform, Zerion CEO and co-founder Evgeny Yurtaev told The Block. Non-custodial in nature, the platform mitigates centralization risks and allows users to control their own funds.","According to a company statement, DeFi has begun to cover all areas of the financial sector, from credit creation to insurance to asset management, presenting superior investment options for users.","\u201CDeFi assets have a much better risk-return profile,\u201D said Yurtaev. \u201CWhereas cryptos are very volatile and hard to predict and stablecoins have extremely low risk but also low return, DeFi is building everything in between.\u201D","Zerion hopes to build a future of permissionless finance where users do not have to rely on any platform. The company is not looking to build its own DeFi protocols, according to Yurtaev, but aims to integrate existing DiFi protocols and make them more accessible to users.","\u201CWe are Coinbase for DeFi,\u201D said Yurtaev. \u201CInstead of bringing fiat money to crypto, we are bringing crypto assets to DeFi.\u201D","Brad Burnham, Venture Partner at Placeholder, said he finds Zerion\u2019s vision appealing, comparing the emergence of DeFi to that of the Internet.","\u201CDeFi, or decentralized finance, feels just as profoundly transformative today as the Internet did then, but it is still too hard to use,\u201D Burham said. \u201CLike with the Internet, it will take a young team, native to the new infrastructure, to simplify the user experience and make it more accessible. I believe Evgeny, Vadim, and Alexey are the right team and Zerion is the right product to bring DeFi to a mainstream audience.\u201D"],"hashtag":[]}
