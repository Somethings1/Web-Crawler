The difficulty changes to ensure that the network keeps processing blocks roughly every 10 minutes, rather than slowing down or increasing over time.","The increase in Bitcoin mining difficulty is the fourth in a row. March 23 saw a more-substantial increase of 7.56%, while the prior two increases went up by 1.16% and 9.95%. This shows that the network has been reacting to gradual increases in hash rate.","The latest block difficulty adjustment pushes the difficulty metric to 47.89 trillion \u2014 another record high.
