During that process the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission will defend their positions.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Policymakers do not intend to ban the private use of self-hosted wallets, the parliamentary staffer said. Provisions outlined are designed to apply to commercial transactions for goods and services to avoid the circumvention of the cash payment caps outlined in the bill, they said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Merchants shouldn\u2019t accept payments over the proposed limits on crypto, according to the draft. Neither should they accept more than \u20AC5,000 ($5,400) in cash. The threshold on permitted crypto payments is much lower, at \u20AC1,000, which may be a topic of further discussion as negotiations continue.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSuch an approach is not technologically neutral, it favors centralized service providers \u2014 [crypto asset services providers, as they are dubbed in MiCA] \u2014 and disincentives self-hosted wallets to research and develop solutions,\u201D the regulatory team at the open source blockchain nonprofit, Iota, wrote in a statement to policymakers shared with The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Parliament's intention is not to target decentralized finance protocols, an insider source said. Self-hosted wallets were not included in the European Commission's original proposal. The Commission is expected to come forward with a more DeFi-focused policy proposal after the 2024 European elections, with preliminary<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/178922\/tradfi-policies-inadequate-for-treating-defi-claims-eu-commission-study\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">research<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> initiatives already underway. Preempting DeFi regulation before that, as self-hosted wallet regulation would imply, could cause legal uncertainty and undermine the existing crypto regulatory frameworks, the source said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The European Parliament also added a revision line into the recent draft. Two years after the regulation is applied, the European Commission may need to assess the need to prohibit anonymous crypto accounts. Another report would need to address whether digital service providers should become obliged entities, potentially setting the table for more legislation.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Brussels-based lobby group Blockchain For Europe wants alignment with existing regulations to ensure \u201Clegal certainty for the crypto assets industry and its consumers,\u201D Secretary General Robert Kopitsch said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Transfer of Funds regulation already enforces know-your-customer rules on transactions to and from self-hosted wallets worth over \u20AC1,000. Meanwhile, the MiCA framework has left decentralized protocols, like the ones often supporting self-hosted wallets, out of its regulatory scope. Both bills are scheduled for a final plenary vote on April 19.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe reality is that unless the EU wants to make all merchants to be [crypto-asset service providers] under MiCA, the payment for goods and services via a self-hosted wallet has been already addressed in the TFR for good,\u201D Kopitsch added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The restrictions on the commercial use of self-hosted addresses in Europe \"will lead other jurisdictions to win from the European Union\u2019s loss,\u201D Mariana de la Roche Wills, regulatory affairs expert at Iota, told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
