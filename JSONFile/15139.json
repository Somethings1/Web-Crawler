The largest crypto by market value was recently changing hands at $63,000 down about 1% in the past 24 hours, holding up better than the broad-market CoinDesk Market Index (CD20), which lost 3% over the same period.","Most altcoin majors also gave up their weekend gains, with ether (ETH), solana (SOL), dogecoin (DOGE) declining 4%-6%.","Crypto markets have been drifting sideways for the last few weeks in lack of a strong investment narrative to drive prices, cooling from last month's record-breaking BTC price action and altcoin and memecoin frenzy. CoinDesk's Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators both remain in neutral reading, indicating a market without a clear direction.","Even though spot-based bitcoin and ether ETFs in Hong Kong will start trading on Tuesday morning local time, the incoming debut didn't spark a similar level of anticipation ahead of the event as to the fever pitch that preceded the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. Notably, BTC nearly doubled in price during three months leading up to the January 11 debut, and significant inflows helped propel BTC over $73,000 in March.","Read more: Hong Kong's Incoming Spot Bitcoin ETFs Could Be 'Big Deal.'
