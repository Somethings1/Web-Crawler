Wormhole is a cross-chain messaging platform that acts as a way to move money across blockchains, including Solana, Ethereum, Aptos and others.","W will launch natively on the Solana and Ethereum networks, according to a webpage released Wednesday, which did not include a date.","The upcoming airdrop appears to mirror that of Pyth \u2013 a fellow Jump Capital-linked crypto project that acts as a data bridge for blockchains \u2013 in many respects, including, most plainly, in website design. That airdrop debuted at a $500 million valuation.","Wormhole officially parted ways with Jump last November and subsequently announced that the service had raised $225 million. Its financial backers are set to receive over 11% of the W token's circulating supply.","This is a developing story."],"entity":[{"type":"Aptos","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$500 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$225 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"11%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Wormhole DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Wormhole","airdrop","Jump Crypto"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
