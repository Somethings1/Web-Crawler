The new rules also closely follow the FCA's draft \"proposals\" issued in January, declaring that \"any token that is not a security token, or an e-money token is unregulated.\" In short, that means those trading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether will remain free from the watchdog's scrutiny, needing to adhere only to KYC rules.&nbsp;","Commentators said the industry \u201Chas been operating on [these rules]\u2026already\" but that having fresh regulatory guidelines would take away additional uncertainty.&nbsp;","The regulator's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/07\/16\/uk-regulator-looking-to-hire-series-of-cryptocurrency-specialists\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto Asset Task Force<\/a> was formed last year and has been hoping to establish how crypto assets fit within the existing regulatory perimeter.

The recent [] paper is another positive sign that progress is being made and that the FCA has a plan.\"","The only outlier is the FCA's stance on banning the sale of cryptocurrency derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors, which it first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/uks-financial-watchdog-proposes-to-ban-crypto-derivatives-for-retail-investors\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced <\/a>earlier this month.","\"Our efforts are [now] focused on the current FCA consultation considering the ban of crypto derivatives...later this year,\" CryptoUK said.","By the FCA's own admission, the guidance does not address each and every specific token query.
