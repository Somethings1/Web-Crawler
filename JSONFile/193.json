This is needed because <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/258299\/grayscale-submits-new-filing-to-sec-in-attempt-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-following-pivotal-court-ruling\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">previous paperwork<\/a> was filed months ago and needs a refresh, the source said. This would likely first show up in a rulemaking section of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nyse.com\/regulation\/rule-filings\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NYSE website<\/a>.","The prospective spot bitcoin ETF issuers will also need to file final S-1 forms, laying out the fees, naming the authorized participants and removing any bracketed items, according to a different source.&nbsp;","In order for spot bitcoin ETFs to go live, the SEC would need to approve the outstanding 19b-4 forms for each fund, which would likely first appear on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/sro\/national-securities-exchanges\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SEC's website<\/a>. The S-1 forms will also need to become effective. The approvals of the separate forms won't necessarily come at the same time.&nbsp;","\"The morning after both are true, trading will start,\" said a source at one prospective issuer.","One source said the 19b-4 approvals will probably come mid-to-late next week and that trading could begin as early as Thursday or Friday next week. Another source noted there is still some uncertainty, given that some spot bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock's, don't have deadlines until March.","Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EricBalchunas\/status\/1742989633561190454\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted on X<\/a> that the \"SEC is giving final comments as we speak, then issuers will submit final 19b-4s and S-1s soon after. So I mean this is [definitely] as close to 'done' as we've been but no official approval as far as I know.\"","\"We don\u2019t comment on individual filings,\" a spokesperson for the SEC told The Block in an emailed response to questions. \"Broadly speaking, if the Commission declares a registration statement effective, that is reflected on EDGAR. Any Commission 19b-4 orders will be posted on our website and then published in the Federal Register.\"","In the last two days, multiple prospective spot bitcoin ETF issuers have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270379\/fidelity-grayscale-filing-8-a-forms-show-progress-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-applications\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">submitted Form 8-As<\/a>, another step forward in the process.
