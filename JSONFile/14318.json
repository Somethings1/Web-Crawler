Since May, over 63,000 crypto users have executed trades totaling over <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/whale_hunter\/dex-trading-bot-wars\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$500 milion<\/a> using the bots, Dune Analytics data indicates.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yet, as activity flourishes, experts are casting a critical eye, particularly concerning how the bots handle user assets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The allure lies in the remarkable simplicity \u2014 trading with them is as easy as sending a message. Based on predefined rules, upon receiving a message they can identify trade commands, interpret them and then promptly execute trades on linked decentralized exchanges.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the bots provide features that streamline the process for traders eager to quickly buy or sell coins on decentralized exchanges, many experts believe their security is among the poorest available in the crypto sector.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think the rise of Telegram bots is a terrible development \u2014 closed source and you are handing over your private keys. This is even worse than back in the day when you sent some funds to an unknown exchange website,\u201D <\/span>Christian Seifert, a former Microsoft security lead and researcher-in-residence at the Forta Network, told The Block. \"The bots might even be riskier than interacting with an unknown smart contract where you can specify and limit the approval. With bots, you essentially hand over everything and hope they don\u2019t take your funds.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To make crypto trading easier for users, Telegram bots are designed to streamline the intricate processes involved in establishing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/249265\/metamask-adds-cash-out-function-allowing-users-to-sell-crypto-for-fiat\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto wallet<\/a> and authorizing necessary permissions for smart contracts behind decentralized exchanges that handle asset transactions. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Initially, a crypto bot creates a wallet for its users, providing them with private keys to facilitate trading. Users are then asked to deposit funds into these wallets to start trading. This presents an issue, however, as it challenges the principle of maintaining secure self-custody of funds.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blockchain security firm BlockSec has expressed apprehension regarding the growing trend of Telegram <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/learn\/245706\/what-are-bots-and-for-what-are-they-used\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bots<\/a>, with co-founder Yajin Zhou emphasizing the potential dangers associated with transferring tokens to third-party wallets created by the apps or disclosing private keys. He pointed out that while the bots excel in offering speed and ease of use, they often come at the cost of security. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When these services automatically generate a wallet for users, there\u2019s an inherent risk pertaining to the continued storage of the private keys on the platform, Zhou explained. Should there be a data breach or hack, it could spell disaster for bot users, leading to potential loss of assets to cybercriminals.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CTo use the bot, users must transfer tokens to a third-party wallet or share their private keys. Who can guarantee that these shared keys won\u2019t be leaked, or that the bot owner won\u2019t misuse them?\u201D Zhou told The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When a bot generates a wallet, it\u2019s essentially creating a cryptographic key pair. The public key is the destination for incoming funds. The private key, being the exclusive access point to these digital assets, can potentially become a prime target; if compromised by malevolent actors, they can drain the associated funds. On the other hand, if a user misplaces the private key without a backup, they\u2019re locked out of their own assets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Zhou further elaborated that since users aren\u2019t the ones generating the private keys, their security is not always assured, opening doors for potential misuse. He also cautioned about the grim prospect of dishonest bot developers exploiting users in the future. Drawing parallels with past market frenzies, like memecoin projects and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/97082\/rug-pull-defi-meerkat-31-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DeFi<\/a>, Zhou reminded that many were unmasked as exit scams, defrauding countless investors.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the rising adoption of the bots, several experts amplified worries about the glaring absence of code security audits that suggests that the safeguarding of user assets could be at risk, especially if there\u2019s a veil of opacity around the project\u2019s mechanics. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThese bots lack a proper security audit, provide no insights into the storage methods for private keys, and there\u2019s an utter void of security documentation on their websites,\u201D said Dave Schwed, COO of the security firm Halborn.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189567\/zksync-passes-security-audit-as-it-gears-up-to-expand-access-to-the-public\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Security audits<\/a>, executed by third-party specialists, evaluate a system\u2019s susceptibility to breaches. Their role is pivotal in ensuring that systems adhere to best practices, safeguarding both user data and assets. A lack of such audits raises red flags, signaling possible omissions or compromises, Schwed highlighted.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moreover, Schwed drew attention to the missing end-to-end encryption on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/64023\/telegram-now-tells-us-investors-to-leave-its-blockchain-project-and-take-72-refund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Telegram<\/a> itself, presenting potential vulnerabilities. \u201CWhile Telegram chats are encrypted, they lack end-to-end encryption. This means Telegram has the ability to decode messages, except when users choose \u2018secret chats.\u2019 Unfortunately, these secret chats don\u2019t support bot interactions,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">End-to-end encryption, featured in \u201Csecret chats,\u201D guarantees that only the conversation participants have the capability to decrypt messages, effectively barring even Telegram from access. This distinct disparity carries significant consequences for both data privacy and security. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Given that bots function within Telegram\u2019s non-end-to-end encrypted domain, any instructions reflecting a user\u2019s financial actions might be at risk,\" Schwed added. Any confidential information relayed to the bot, be it transaction specifics or mere commands \u2014 stands the risk of potential exposure, he continued.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
