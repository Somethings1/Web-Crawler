The firm closed the round before mid-March, when global equity markets plunged significantly due to the coronavirus.&nbsp;","\"Given the current global crisis, 2020 will likely not get us to the black. The timing of our fundraise puts us in a good position. We are aiming to extend our brand image and providing the market with unique data to help institutions invest. &nbsp;We believe 2021 will be a turning point,\" Coin Metrics CEO Tim Rice told The Block.&nbsp;","The Boston-based startup was founded in 2017 by Nic Carter and Aleksei Nokhrin, and provides blockchain network and exchange data to institutional clients.
