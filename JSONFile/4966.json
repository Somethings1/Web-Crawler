Bitcoin also made notable gains, reaching a daily high of $37,925 before falling back in a swathe of long liquidations to $36,311.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thursday's market uptick is part of a multi-faceted event-led rally, according to analysts at Bitfinex. \"<\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">We believe that we are in an accumulation phase for the next cycle and the bottom could very well be in place,\" Bitfinex analysts told The Block.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said Thursday's price spike was also triggered by spot ETF-related remarks made by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart. On Thursday, a window opened for the SEC to \"theoretically issue approval orders\" for a spot bitcoin ETF, they wrote.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"A brief window opens on November 9 for the SEC to potentially approve all 12 U.S. spot bitcoin ETF applicants, including Grayscale's GBTC. Even if approvals don't arrive this month, we still believe there's a 90% chance of approval by January 10,\" the Bloomberg analysts noted.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, speaking to The Block, Butterfill cautioned against predicting whether approvals will materialize within this window. The CoinShares analyst added that markets are extremely sensitive to the spot ETF topic.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"This sensitivity was evident in our recent investor survey, where nearly 60% of investor concerns were centered on government regulation. Therefore, any positive news in this area is likely to be, and has been, eagerly seized upon by investors,\" he added.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Analysts see more factors involved in bitcoin's recent price spike. Apart from anticipation over the possible approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, these include bullish movements in the macroeconomic environment, such as major U.S. indices clocking their longest winning streaks in two years, and a shift in the bitcoin market share from short-term holders to long-term holders.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"This bullish attitude is caused by the synergy of ETF approval expectations and optimism in the U.S. stock market. I think we have a great chance to see a $40,000 level for bitcoin in the near future,\" YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha told The Block.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lienkha added Thursday's rally looks like it will sustain, \"as interest rates for stablecoins are skyrocketing in the crypto world right now.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Risk assets are catching tailwinds in the wider economy. On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 logged its eighth straight session in the green, and the Nasdaq clocked its ninth straight day of gains, its longest winning streak in two years.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yet, James Butterfill does not perceive today's market rally as a response to broader market events. \"Bitcoin has been gradually decoupling from equities since the beginning of 2023, so the correlation between bitcoin and equities has significantly dropped from 72% to just 20% as of now,\" he said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FRNT Financial Head of Data Strahinja Savic highlighted blockchain data revealing a decline in bitcoin short-term holder supply, with the trend contributing to an upward price trajectory during a phase of increased demand. \"For instance, 69% of bitcoin has moved for over a year, suggesting the majority of investors hodling,\" he noted.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
