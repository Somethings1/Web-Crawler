Bitcoin mixers combine payments from multiple users into a single transaction, masking their origin.","","","Overall, darknet entities sent 7,946 bitcoins to mixers in Q1 2020 as compared to 790 bitcoins in Q1 2019. While in terms of USD, the value grew sharply from $3 million in Q1 2019 to $67 million in Q1 2020.","The amount of bitcoin received by darknet entities from mixing services also increased three-fold, from 106 bitcoins in Q1 2019 to 288 bitcoins in Q1 2020. In terms of USD, the amount increased to nearly $2 million in Q1 2020 as compared to $400,000 in Q1 2019.","","","\u201CWhile more exchanges implement the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) requirements, darknet users are trying to avoid the risk of unveiling of their activity by those exchanges. To veil darknet activities, they started to prefer mixing services to exchanges for withdrawal of cryptocurrency,\u201D said Crystal Blockchain.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nOverall, the total amount of bitcoin sent and received by darknet entities decreased in Q1 2020 as compared to Q1 2019. This could be due to the growing popularity of altcoin usage, said Crystal Blockchain.","However, in terms of USD, darknet entities exchanged an increased amount of money \u2014 from $384 million in Q1 2019 to $411 million in Q1 2020. \u201CThis is partly explained by the growing capitalization of bitcoin, as well as further mass adoption of bitcoin. As it becomes increasingly easier to use cryptocurrency, the popularity of this payment method is steadily increasing,\u201D said the firm."],"hashtag":["BITCOIN"]}
