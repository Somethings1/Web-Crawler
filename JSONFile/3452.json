Tokensoft, Inc. et al., Cal. Superior Court (County of San Francisco, Case Number CGC-19\u2013574792, 3\/26\/2019) [SDP]<\/strong><\/em>","This lawsuit alleges age and sex discrimination under California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act (\u201CFEHA\u201D) against a company that describes itself as providing \u201Cinstitutional grade compliance for blockchain-based securities.\u201D (As a reminder, lawsuits such as this one contains unproven allegations\u200A\u2014\u200Athe plaintiff has the burden of proof and the defendant will have the opportunity to answer and deny the allegations or seek dismissal of the claims).","According to the Plaintiff she is a 55 year old woman who is a business and technology leader with a B.S. and M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering who was previously qualified with Series 7, 24 and 63 FINRA investment banking qualifications. She was hired by TokenSoft\u2019s CEO to serve as Head of Corporate Development, for a set fee plus commission, without benefits or equity.","In May 2018 she says she asked the CEO if she could accompany him to a blockchain conference in New York, presumably Consensus. He allegedly said there was no point in both of attending, but then took a dude (younger) with him instead and then hired him to be the Direct of East Coast Operations and Business Development and then (allegedly) hired another dude (also younger) to be head of Corporate Development. Both of them were hired as employees, with benefits and equity.","When she confronted TokenSoft\u2019s CEO he then (allegedly) said \u201Che hired them after a venture capitalist colleague advised him to hire \u2018young, hungry guys,\u2019 who would be willing to work under a primarily commission-based structure with a lower base salary than [Plaintiff].\u201D The Complaint says the CEO didn\u2019t allow her to attend weekly sales meetings, \u201Ceven though [she] was part of the weekly sales team and responsible for business development.\u201D The Complaint proceeds in this fashion, detailing a narrative that excludes the plaintiff from any meaningful opportunity within the company and instead throwing full support behind the younger male employees.","While most people think of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in employment discrimination cases, sex and age discrimination claims generally require the employer have a minimum number of employees for federal claims to arise. Here, the plaintiff filed under California state law, after first filing with the California State Department of Fair Employment and being given what is known as \u201Ca right to sue\u201D by that agency.","Bottom line\u200A\u2014\u200Ait doesn\u2019t matter whether you are a blockchain startup or a fortune 500 company, under U.S. law you can\u2019t discriminate against people because of their age or gender. I\u2019m not saying that happened here. The plaintiff has the burden of proof. But note that blockchain isn\u2019t a defense to be a horse\u2019s ass, so if your V.C. really did tell you that you should focus on hiring \u201Cyoung, hungry guys,\u201D consider finding a new V.C. and definitely not repeating that comment to someone who you later fire.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
