And also combine that with all the crypto native benefits of global payment rates, easy ability to transact and send peer-to-peer so it becomes really liquid and moves quickly.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As household name companies (such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/115333\/visa-buys-cryptopunk-first-steps-nft-commerce\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Visa<\/a> or Coca-Cola) begin to explore NFTs, Fitch sees an opportunity forming for brands to commodify \"what culture is\" for their brand and community. He related the growth in NFTs to luxury watches and their collectors, both of which are dependent on a community of buyers to maintain their value. With NFT\u2019s, he argues, the marketplace is built into the ecosystem of NFTs and he believes its ease of access will help to maintain a product's liquidity. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On this episode of The Scoop podcast, Fitch also touched on how NFTs can be collateralized in the same way products like Yeezy sneakers can be collateralized via the fractional art market with companies such as StockX. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt's easier to have that liquidity. It's easier to have that peer-to-peer price discovery.\u201D Fitch told Chaparro.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Much like the way watches are collected to connote social status, NFT's can actually be built to have additional use cases to unlock VIP access within the Metaverse. Fitch observed how NFT's are being used as a means to unlock experiences within online communities and in the Metaverse:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Now we have ways to codify, financialize, commodify artifacts of culture, and we have ways to communicate them peer-to-peer, socially, signal with them, unlock experiences with them.\"<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
