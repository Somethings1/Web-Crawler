Mining should be available to anyone and we refuse to jeopardize our users\u2019 privacy,\u201D said Simplecoin.","Christian Grieger, co-founder of Simplecoin, told The Block that the firm has 42,000 users and two employees. Grieger co-founded Simplecoin with Marvin Janssen in Aug. 2018. \u201CSimplecoin allowed users to save mined hashes (digital points) and cash them out for any of the supported currencies, including proof of stake coins that are no longer mineable,\u201D Grieger told The Block.","Users of Simplecoin have until Dec. 20 to withdraw their funds and until Dec. 31 to delete their account information as after this date, wallets and the entire platform will be shut down.","Another firm, bitcoin gaming platform Chopcoin, also co-founded by Grieger is <a href=\"https:\/\/chopcoin.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shutting down<\/a> for the same reason. <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/lu\/en\/pages\/risk\/articles\/amld5-has-entered-into-force.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AMLD5<\/a> imposes more stringent reporting obligations for cryptocurrency firms and authorizes Financial Intelligence Units to obtain the addresses and identities of cryptocurrency owners and users.","Grieger told The Block that he co-founded Chopcoin with Joshua Stoffels in Sept. 2015 and the firm has 305,000 users and two employees. Both Simplecoin and Chopcoin did not ever raise any funding from venture firms or investors, Grieger told The Block, adding that he has some plans for other businesses but declined to share further details.","Simplecoin and Chopcoin aren\u2019t the only crypto firms impacted by the regulations.
