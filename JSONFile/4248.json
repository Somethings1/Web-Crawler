Adding to the concerns: conversations between OPEC and Russia broke down over the weekend, a development which precipitated a 30% drop in the price of crude. At last check, Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading down more than 1,400 points this morning.","Indeed, the VIX index \u2013 which measures 30-day implied volatility \u2013 soared to 62 during this morning's session, which is close to where it stood during the financial crisis.&nbsp;","","","Still, some crypto traders are surprised that there isn't more panic in the market.&nbsp;","\"It's a casual slide down,\" Darius Sit of crypto derivatives trader QCP told The Block. \"Which is strange.\"","Max Boonen, co-founder of B2C2, said revised growth expectations would have more of an impact on equities relative to bitcoin, which might be playing into the more sanguine sentiment.&nbsp;","\"Stocks are down big time because the growth expectations have been revised much lower,\" he said. \"Bitcoin does not really depend on economic growth. It's not a stock with dividends.\"","Regardless of the asset class, an increase in volatility is a good thing for some traders and brokers who thrive during these kinds of market conditions. High-frequency traders like Virtu Financial make markets during these conditions and earn money on the spread between the price investors want to buy or sell a stock. When volatility increases, that spread widens and firms generally can make more money.","Virtu is one of the few stocks in the green today, trading up 1.9% at time of writing.","The same logic goes for crypto market-making firms, industry sources say.","\"I suspect everyone in a similar business benefits to varying degrees based on the exact strategy,\" Boonen said, adding:&nbsp;\"We had a big February.\"&nbsp;Since the beginning of March, Boonen said the firm has raked in as much profit as it did in December.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
