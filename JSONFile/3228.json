The analyst suggested that the current put-call ratio indicates derivatives traders are also not factoring in the possibility that the SEC could reject ETF applications.","\"The put-call ratio has declined significantly to 0.55, and remains low in terms of the past 24 hours at 0.43 which suggests that at least in the past couple of days there has not been any significant increase in hedging for an SEC rejection,\" Kooner said.","A put-call ratio of less than 1 implies bullish sentiment, indicating more interest in potential upside (calls). In contrast to this, a put-call ratio greater than 1 typically suggests bearish sentiment, indicating more interest in downside protection (puts).","In the past 24 hours the price of ether has risen by over 3% to trade at $2,991 at 1:50 p.m. ET, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248349\/ethereum-eth-usd\" data-v-02bbd79b=\"\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's Price Page<\/a>.","Fluctuating price action in the past 24 hours has caused a spike in liquidations of ether positions, totaling over $33 million, according to Coinglass <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinglass.com\/LiquidationData\" data-v-02bbd79b=\"\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a>.
