The network currently supports distinct transaction hashes for each ecosystem, a complexity the team plans to eliminate.","While Cosmos transactions cater to essential network operations like staking and governance, Ethereum transactions facilitate interactions with dApps via the Ethereum Virtual Machine on Evmos.","The strategic move to an EVM-centric transaction approach will allow the Evmos team to focus on simplification. The change is also anticipated to ease the workload for developers of wallets and blockchain explorers by removing the necessity to support two transaction formats.","The inherent distinction between Cosmos and Ethereum transactions, particularly the presence of two types of transaction hashes, adds complexity for wallet and explorer developers, as the team explained. For instance, this differentiation prevents Cosmos transactions from being indexed by EVM-based wallets, which in turn hinders the user experience. With this shift, the Evmos team will need to maintain less infrastructure, thereby allowing them to concentrate on enhancing the EVM user experience and interoperability.","Evmos will maintain the core Cosmos functionalities, such as staking and token transfers through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230772\/evmos-unveils-evm-extensions-to-boost-cosmos-interoperability\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EVM Extensions<\/a>, preserving uninterrupted access for users and developers to these features.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWith the decision to maintain only compatibility with Ethereum-type transactions, we aim to increase our operational efficiency, align more closely to Ethereum developers and ship value to our users faster, while still supporting the core functionalities like staking, governance and interoperability that make Cosmos unique via our EVM Extensions,\u201D Evmos co-founder Federico Kunze Küllmer said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kunze Küllmer added that<\/span> Cosmos' native cross-chain interoperability protocol, IBC, will continue to receive full support and enhancements from Evmos.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the transition, fees from the phased-out Cosmos transactions will be burned, marking a phased cessation of Cosmos transactions. Users with Cosmos-only wallets will be needed migrate to EVM-compatible clients, with popular wallets like WalletConnect, Rabby, and MetaMask offering the necessary support. Furthermore, hardware wallets such as Ledger will remain supported through their dedicated Ethereum applications.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Evmos is part of the Cosmos network \u2014 an interoperability network hosting over 50 unique Layer 1 blockchains.
