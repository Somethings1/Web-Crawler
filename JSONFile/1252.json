The Times later launched a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsprovenanceproject.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">website<\/a> for the News Provenance Project, which indicated it would move \"from research to execution\" during a new phase in 2020.","Friday's blog post details the results of that execution. As Reddy noted:","From a technology perspective, Reddy said that the Times \"wanted to see if it was possible to record everything that happens to a photo, from capture to publication, in the form of photo metadata and display that information on social media platforms.\"","\"Blockchain's ability to preserve the full history of a photo separately from the image file itself made it a compelling technology for our explorations around tracking provenance,\" she continued.","For the trial, The Times said it built a network of test news organizations as well as a social media platform that would link them. Additionally, the organizations had shared ownership of a distributed ledger and database between them and \"could make changes to photo metadata in the database.\"","The end result, per Reddy: \"When testing our prototype with users, we found that it effectively helped them make informed judgments about photos in a social media feed. Yet, there is more research and exploration that needs to be done.\"","\"While blockchain technology could be a viable tool in helping preserve the origin of news photos, there are a number of challenges that would need to be addressed before it could be widely used,\" she continued.","According to Reddy, prototype-centric assumptions would face critical tests in real-world environments, including about the content that exists on the blockchain itself as well as how photos may be altered when shared on social media. Reddy also stressed that \"[b]lockchain networks must be accessible to news organizations\" and that for such a system to work, a variety of outlets would need to be brought in with the lowest barrier to entry possible.","\"This prototype was an experiment that taught us a lot about the power of credible, contextual information in social media feeds, but there is a long way to go before something like this can be fully realized,\" Reddy wrote."],"hashtag":["SOCIAL MEDIA"]}
