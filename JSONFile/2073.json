He recounted an error he discovered in the code and says he told Bankman-Fried about it in a Signal message which was later autodeleted.&nbsp;","After a game of paddle tennis, Yedidia said he asked Bankman-Fried, \"Are things ok?\"","\"We were bulletproof last year. We\u2019re not bulletproof this year,\u201D he recounted Bankman-Fried as saying, adding that that the former CEO had wanted to raise more cash from Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.&nbsp;","Yedidia shared a house at MIT with both Bankman-Fried and fellow executive Gary Wang, and would also eventually share the penthouse apartment at The Albany resort in the Bahamas with them and other FTX senior employees.","Yedidia confirmed he was well paid, with a base salary of almost $200,000 a year and bonuses that stretched into the millions.&nbsp;","Yedidia said Bankman-Fried occasionally slept on a beanbag in Hong Kong but much more rarely, if at all, in the Bahamas.","Bankman-Fried's lawyers struggled during cross examination, with various questions being thrown out on objection. They attempted to show that Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t spend money on himself, noting he did not buy expensive watches, a yacht, or an expensive sports car, preferring instead a Toyota Corolla.","The defense also argued that FTX had plenty of checks in place to stop U.S. users and businesses from using the international exchange.","Yedidia's cross-examination is set to continue Thursday afternoon."],"hashtag":["FTX","SBF TRIAL"]}
