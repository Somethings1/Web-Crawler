In the wake of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit against Coinbase and Binance, the firm ended support for a number of cryptocurrencies, including Solana and Cardano \u2014 a move that could put further pressure on its crypto trading volumes.&nbsp;","To be sure, Robinhood isn't alone. A relatively somnolent crypto market has resulted in lower trading volumes across the board, which in turns means less profit for companies facilitating trading. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/total-exchange-volume-daily\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">seven day moving average<\/a> for crypto exchange volumes is hovering below $20 billion \u2014 sharply down from an all-time high of over $150 billion. Still, BlackRock's filing for a spot bitcoin ETF has kicked off a rally that's helped to elevate volumes slightly.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/total-exchange-volume-daily\/embed\" title=\"Daily Exchange Volume (7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
