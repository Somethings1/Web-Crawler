Last fall, Coinbase applied for membership in the National Futures Association, the premier US self-regulatory organization for such businesses. Coinbase\u2019s membership is still pending, per the NFA\u2019s website.","The second is Coinbase DCM, which is where the now-rebranded FairX\u2019s registration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) comes into play.

In November 2020, Nodal Clear was granted approval by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cftc.gov\/PressRoom\/PressReleases\/8306-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CFTC<\/a> to clear contracts for other DCMs.","Looking ahead, Coinbase said in its presentation that it is moving to onboard brokers, market makers and other FCMs to its platform as well as working with the CFTC on its planned offering. Coinbase is also \u201Cdeveloping new crypto futures products to serve the needs of institutional and retail end users,\u201D per the presentation.","According to a source with knowledge of the roadmap, FairX \u2013 now Coinbase Derivatives \u2013 will continue to operate and launch crypto derivatives for its clients directly. A broader launch of derivatives for Coinbase\u2019s userbase is pending regulatory approval.","Tuesday\u2019s developments perhaps add new fuel to the budding marketplace for crypto derivatives in the US, with FTX.US seeking a path of its own.
