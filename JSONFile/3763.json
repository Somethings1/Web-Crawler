But technically, things get a little more complicated.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The REPLICATOR is essentially a custom smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain built under the ERC-721 standard. In other words, this type of token is unique and can have a different value from another token from the same smart contract. The piece is designed to create new, unique NFTs over the next year.

As soon as the idea of a photocopier came into my head I knew it was perfect. The story of a machine through time.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Rebekah Bowling, a specialist of the 20th Century &amp; Contemporary Art department at Phillips, the most compelling part of the REPLICATOR is the way it relies on technology to do what it is meant to do.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s a cool use of technology and a really compelling art object. Its form and medium have such a meaningful relationship,\u201D she said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When asked if Phillips plans to sell more NFTs, Bowling said the auction house hopes to work with artists that have already made a name for themselves as well those who are exploring the space in an interesting way. Bowling also addressed some of the criticism NFTs have gotten in recent weeks.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe things [NFTs] that are going to last are conceptually tight and interesting,\u201D she said. \u201CWhile there is some speculation going on, the possibilities that this technology is offering, especially to digitally native artists and to artists that haven\u2019t had a way to commercialize their work before, for them this could be life-changing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dowbak says he doesn\u2019t expect to create another self-replicating NFT, calling the REPLICATOR a \u201Ccontained idea\u201D that needs \u201Cits own spotlight and journey.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhat makes REPLICATOR special, other than the new ground it's breaking is that its path is unknown,\u201D he said. \u201CI love the idea of non-deterministic art.
