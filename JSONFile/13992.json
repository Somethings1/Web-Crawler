Delphi, which competes with The Block to offer research on the crypto industry, had been a backer of the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a Singapore-based non-profit entity with a mission to boost the Terra ecosystem.&nbsp;","\u201CWe always knew something like this was possible, and we tried to stress the risks to a system like this in our research and public commentary, but the fact is we miscalculated the risk of a \u2018death spiral\u2019 event coming to fruition,\u201D Delphi said. \u201CWe\u2019ve taken some heat for this over the last week, and we deserve it. The criticism is fair and we accept it.\u201D","As recently as April, Delphi had written in a research newsletter that LFG's bitcoin purchases \"gives higher security to defend UST\u2019s peg to the dollar\" and is \"likely reducing the risk of it heading into a death spiral.\" And in March the firm had launched an offer to allow clients to pay for their subscription with their UST balance and interest earned from Terra's Anchor Protocol.&nbsp;","Delphi is one of a large number of crypto operators that carried significant exposure to the Terra ecosystem at the time of its collapse. In its post, the group assessed the damage publicly for the first time.","Delphi said its venture capital arm Delphi Ventures Master Fund had, in early 2021, purchased an amount of Terra\u2019s native token Luna equal to 0.5% of its net asset value (NAV). That exposure increased over time, resulting in \u201Ca large unrealized loss.\u201D At its peak price, Luna and other Terra-native tokens accounted for around 13% of Delphi Ventures' NAV.","These numbers include a $10 million investment in Luna in February, part of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/134871\/luna-founation-guard-token-sale\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a $1 billion token sale<\/a> by LFG. Delphi said that investment is \u201Centirely lost\u201D based on Luna's current price, but stressed that it sold no Luna during the token\u2019s slide. José Maria Macedo, a partner at Delphi Digital, is a member of LFG\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/lfg.org\/team\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">governing council<\/a>.","Delphi Labs, the software research and development company, suffered worst among the group\u2019s offshoots. Delphi Labs spent more than a year working on joint ventures focused on the Astroport and Mars protocols on Terra \u2014 and had received grants of 30,000 LUNA and 466,666 UST from Terraform Labs for its work on the latter. The group stressed that the labs entity never sold any of the tokens it holds.","\u201CWe decided to build on Terra because we believed that decentralized money had the greatest chance of succeeding if it were to be integrated at the L1, focused on real world adoption, and built on a relatively scalable and interoperable blockchain,\u201D said Delphi. \u201CAs for the future, after making a big bet on Terra and failing, we want to make sure we learn our lessons and make the right choice on where to focus our efforts. We\u2019ve put together a cross-sectional team of some of our brightest minds across Research and Labs and we\u2019ll be taking our time to ensure we assess all possible options and make the right long-term decision.\u201D","Delphi also shared reflections on Terra\u2019s Anchor Protocol, which advertised interest rates of 20% to UST depositors.","The group said it had seen the LFG \u2014 and the bitcoin reserves it amassed to backstop UST in times of stress \u2014 as a \u201Ca massive step\u201D towards mitigating the risk of a bank run on the Anchor Protocol. \u201CIt effectively converted some of the excess UST demand into exogenous reserves that could be used to defend the peg if necessary,\u201D said Delphi. \u201CCreating partial exogenous collateralization while bringing down Anchor APY would materially reduce the systemic risk in the network.\u201D","Delphi continued: \u201CWe believed a high level of external collateralization was a necessity in the long run, and we saw this as a path to get there. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t grow fast enough compared to UST supply, and, combined with a fall in value of the BTC reserves, the liability overhang was too large to be defended.\u201D","Delphi\u2019s research arm had churned out six Terra-focused reports since February 2021 \u2014 none of which were paid for, according to the group's blog post. It said Delphi Research was largely unaffected by Terra\u2019s implosion, from a financial standpoint.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
