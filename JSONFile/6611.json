On this week's episode of The Scoop, he broke down how he arrived at that conclusion.","ARK began looking into digital assets in 2015, when BTC was trading around $250. At that time, the firm published a white paper arguing BTC was unique and didn't fall into a traditional asset class. Now, it's published a part two to that early paper aimed at institutions.&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b>\"In addition to sizing that opportunity for institutions, we really tried to look at what the liquidity and volume profile of Bitcoin are relative to other asset classes and whether or not we're at we're at a place where Bitcoin can support the institutional flow that we so desire,\" he said. \"With that...indeed, we think that over the next five years, Bitcoin presents a multi trillion dollar opportunity.<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"<\/i>","Elmandjra detailed the path to the moon on this week's episode, as well as:","Â© 2023 The Block.
