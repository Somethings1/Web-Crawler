Wu Blockchain first <a href=\"https:\/\/wublock.substack.com\/p\/a-proposal-for-hong-kong-to-issue?sd=pf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> the news.","The proposal emphasizes the importance of stablecoins as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy, highlighting the authors\u2019 perceived benefits of a Hong Kong Dollar-pegged stablecoin in enhancing financial inclusiveness, boosting transaction efficiency, reducing costs, improving payment systems and strengthening the Chinese special administrative region\u2019s fintech capabilities.","The experts argue that the government\u2019s current plan, allowing private institutions to issue stablecoins, is not ambitious enough and may result in limited market share. They say it draws a parallel between Singapore\u2019s XSGD stablecoin issued by Xfers with a market cap of $6.6 million, compared to more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$110 billion<\/a> for USDT and USDC combined.&nbsp;","With Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves \u2014 some <a href=\"https:\/\/wublock.substack.com\/p\/a-proposal-for-hong-kong-to-issue?sd=pf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$430 billion<\/a> as of March \u2014 exceeding the combined market capitalization of USDT and USDC, an HKDG stablecoin backed by the government would offer higher credibility and lower risk, the proposal said.","The proposal did acknowledge potential risks, such as legal and regulatory challenges, technical risks and short-term exchange rate fluctuations, but argues that the risks borne by government-issued HKDG were lower than those of stablecoins issued by private institutions.&nbsp;","HKDG would benefit from government regulation and the transparency provided by blockchain technology, the authors said.&nbsp;","Additionally, the paper argued HKDG would help Hong Kong to take a substantial step toward de-dollarization and challenge the dominance of the U.S. Dollar in the crypto ecosystem. The experts claimed it could also provide additional liquidity for government investment projects, facilitate the digitization of traditional assets, promote financial innovation and competitiveness and increase transparency.&nbsp;","Hong Kong has recently signaled its desire to reestablish itself as a global hub for the crypto industry, setting up a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/237483\/hong-kong-government-sets-up-web3-task-force-to-help-build-a-thriving-ecosystem\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">web3 task force<\/a> to help \u201Cbuild a thriving ecosystem\u201D in the region.","Â© 2023 The Block.
