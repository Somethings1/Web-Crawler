The UK's financial regulator also noted that authorized firms can charge for this service, emphasizing that \"It is ultimately a commercial decision for a firm whether they offer this service.\"","Archax CMO Simon Barnby told The Block that the firm has an assessment criteria process in place for deciding which crypto asset service providers they will work with. \"We have a process in place which includes adverse media checks, full due diligence, and AML\/KYC checks,\" Barnby said.","Barnby added that Archax charges crypto asset service providers an upfront fee to set everything up and then an ongoing service fee. \"The actual fee levels depend a lot on the requirements and activities of the client that need to be covered,\" he said.","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The&nbsp;<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fca.org.uk\/consumers\/warning-list-unauthorised-firms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FCA also put out an announcement on Oct. 8<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> warning that 143 entities are operating in the UK without permission and naming them in a list.

To stay on the right side of the regulations, unregistered crypto asset firms have four routes to lawfully communicate crypto asset promotions within the UK.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The first route is that a promotion is communicated by an FCA-authorized person. The second is that a financial promotion is approved by an authorized person. The third way, employed by Coinbase, OKX, and Binance, involves the promotion being communicated by a crypto firm registered under the FCA's anti-money laundering regulations. <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lastly, promotions that comply with the conditions of an exemption in the Financial Promotion Order are deemed lawful.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The regulator said unregistered crypto asset firms who fail to comply with the new financial promotions guidelines are likely to be in breach of section 21 of the UK's Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. This would be a criminal offense, punishable by up to two years imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both.<\/span>","(<i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with additional quotes from Archax CMO Simon Barnby and the FCA<\/i>)","© 2023 The Block.
