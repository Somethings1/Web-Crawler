Elliptic will provide Zilliqa an ongoing anti-money laundering (AML) compliance support for its native token ZIL, as well as recently launched stablecoin XSGD - pegged 1:1 to the Singapore dollar.","Put simply, Elliptic will identify and help block potential transactions linked to illicit activities on the Zilliqa network, via its blockchain transactions monitoring tool.","As it is the start of the partnership, Elliptic is yet to determine how much worth of ZIL tokens are tied to illicit activities. \u201CWe have not yet completed the work that would be required to provide these kinds of statistics,\u201D Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist of Elliptic, told The Block, adding:","\u201COne interesting trend we're seeing is that regulators are increasingly looking to see whether blockchain monitoring capabilities are available on specific stablecoins, when considering regulatory approval.
