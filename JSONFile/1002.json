The more demand from ETFs, the more the float is affected. And the more the float\u2019s affected, the price goes up, which would create more demand,\u201D said Balchunas in an interview. \u201CYou could have an upward spiral that goes a little while.\u201D","Balchunas, who has been very closely tracking the launch of the bitcoin spot ETFs, had estimated the ETFs would see an upper band of inflows of $10-15 billion. So far, these ETFs are already at $7 billion and it\u2019s only been a month.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/spot-bitcoin-etf-aum-ex-gbtc-daily\/embed\" title=\"Spot Bitcoin ETF AUM ex-GBTC (Daily)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","\u201CIf the price cooperates, they're probably going to do multitudes of my estimate,\u201D he said, noting that the ETF action is starting to remind him of a mania, likening it to Ark Invest, which was hot for a period of around a year.&nbsp;","\u201CThe way people are talking and the sort of volume increase matched with the price increase, it's all feeding on in on itself,\u201D he added.","Balchunas was cautious, however, regarding the ETFs' ability to sustain recent inflow levels. Were the ETFs to continue at this current pace, it would be around $150 billion of inflows over the year, tenfold what he predicts. \u201CThat would be crazy,\u201D he said.","He also warned that rising bitcoin prices might be unsustainable, and wondered aloud as to whether there will be a correction period that could sober people up.","The analyst said it wouldn\u2019t count for much if a big company put a large amount of funds into the ETFs in one shot. The result would show a sudden growth, which would then go flat.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes\/embed\" title=\"Spot Bitcoin ETF Volumes\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Balchunas added that over the years he\u2019s observed that volume is the leading indicator for ETFs. If there\u2019s high volume, it tends to lead to higher asset flows over time, he said.&nbsp;","\u201CVolume is not man made. It has to grow naturally. It's very coveted,\u201D he said."],"hashtag":["SPOT BITCOIN ETF"]}
