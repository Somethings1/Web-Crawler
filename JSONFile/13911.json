In terms of the social media fund, Yakovenko said the amount deployed so far is \u201Cnowhere near half.\u201D","\u201CWe've done like a bunch of small investments, like usually our seed level checks from solana ventures are $100K or something like that. So we're never a big lead,\u201D he said.&nbsp;","Due to a prevalence of well-capitalized VC funds that are interested in the Solana ecosystem, Solana Labs has been able to be frugal with its investments, he added.","When it comes to social media, Yakovenko said a number of products are in development, including Dispatch, Squads, Dialect and Wordcell, which are effectively decentralized versions of Reddit, WhatsApp, Twitter and other social media platforms.","\u201CSo every permutation of social is being tried. It's still very early, right?\u201D Yakovenko said, adding that the projects have had only had 12 months to build so far and are under the gun to grind for product market fit. \u201CI would love to see like a million users across all of them by next Breakpoint.\u201D","As for the gaming funds, more capital has been deployed there, a spokesperson for Solana Labs chimed in. But it\u2019s the same picture. Yakovenko said only small checks have written and Solana Labs hasn\u2019t had to deploy most of the fund.&nbsp;","As for the state of blockchain gaming on Solana, Yakovenko said that 37 games are either live or in the process of going live. He contrasted it with the previous Breakpoint, where there was a dearth of gaming teams.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
