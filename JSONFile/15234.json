COIN remains above that level in both ARKK and ARKW.","ARKW also dumped more stock of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), reducing its holding by 398,383 while loading up another 158,334 shares of Block (SQ), which offers payments in crypto through its Cash App and earlier this month unveiled a new self-custody bitcoin wallet.","While GBTC\u2019s discount to net asset value widened slightly, just 0.33 percentage points, Wednesday to 7.9%, it's still well below the 12.5% it touched earlier this month and holding near the narrowest since August 2021, according to Ycharts data.
