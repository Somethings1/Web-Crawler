Many of those initiatives involve NFTs.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, Soto-Wright insists he\u2019s a down-to-earth guy who used to sleep on a tatami mat early in his career in London to save money for rent. \u201CI came from that bootstrapper mindset,\u201D he said in an interview with The Block. \u201CIt\u2019s not been an overnight success.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He frames his glamorous lifestyle as part of a mission to make crypto culturally relevant. \u201CIt goes back to why are we doing this?

He points out that MoonPay\u2019s HyperMint went live as recently as June, with launch partners including Fox Corporation and Death Row Records.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThey had the full knowledge of knowing what the climate was, so that if they were hesitant, they could have pulled back and said, \u2018we don\u2019t want to do it\u2019 \u2014 but they said, \u2018we absolutely want to do it,\u2019\u201D Soto-Wright said.

Former Time magazine president Keith Grossman will now spearhead that effort \u2014&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/decrypt.co\/115775\/executive-who-brought-time-magazine-into-web3-is-leaving-for-moonpay\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">joining MoonPay<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> as president of its enterprise division last week.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhere is the most valuable Intellectual Property being created?\u201D Soto-Wright asked. \u201CWell, a lot of it is being created in Hollywood, a lot of it is being created by some of the world\u2019s biggest brands.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Supporting his thesis is the fact that, despite the wider slump in the NFT market this year, some corporate experimentation has proven extremely lucrative. A report published in October by the research arm of Galaxy Digital showed that Nike had already <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179004\/nft-royalties-have-generated-1-8-billion-with-nike-bayc-coming-out-top-galaxy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pocketed more than $91 million<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in NFT royalties.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Soto-Wright sees MoonPay\u2019s new divisions \u2014 those catering to big brands and other creators \u2014 as \u201Cincreasing the surface area\u201D of its core payments business. To him, there is a cohesion between MoonPay\u2019s offshoots that perhaps is less obvious to outsiders. \u201CThese are all highly interrelated building blocks together, right? There\u2019s payments infrastructure, there\u2019s smart contract infrastructure, and there\u2019s the wallet scaffolding that connects it,\u201D he said, adding that a lot of energy this year has gone towards positioning MoonPay as a comprehensive \u201Cweb3 infrastructure.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With so many new projects, Soto-Wright unsurprisingly described 2022 as an \u201CR&amp;D year\u201D for the business, in which it shifted away from profitability. He could hardly have picked a riskier year for experimentation.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MoonPay was not exposed to FTX and took no financial hit from its collapse. As things stand, the company is not planning any layoffs and has over five years of financial runway, Soto-Wright said.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That is not to say, however, that he is not cautious about getting caught out in the crypto winter.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the start of year, Soto-Wright hoped to double the company\u2019s headcount \u2014 which today stands around 280. Now, he is more focused on establishing a clear corporate culture, and less on personnel growth. \u201CI\u2019d like us to be like 300 Spartans,\u201D he said. \u201CWe want to be lean. We want to be financially disciplined. I don\u2019t see us making huge increases in our headcount until we feel really confident about how the team is operating.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The startup published a blog post outlining its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.moonpay.com\/blog\/moonpay-values\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">corporate values<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in September 2021. One of those is \u201Ckaizen\u201D \u2014 a Japanese word close to Soto-Wright's heart that means \u201Cchange for better.\u201D He said the term embodies his own love of sports. He rowed for St. Anne\u2019s College at Oxford University, often posts footage of himself doing pull-ups at a public park on Instagram and is a fan of wellness activities, in particular the sauna.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI\u2019m definitely not the four hours on a beanbag kind of guy,\u201D he said \u2014 a reference to former FTX boss Bankman-Fried\u2019s sleeping habits. \u201CI make sure I try to hit the sauna as much as possible and just try to keep my mind focused, because there\u2019s so much stuff that you\u2019re doing.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It is a precarious time indeed to have so many plates spinning, and Soto-Wright acknowledges that MoonPay still needs \u201Cprove out\u201D its new projects.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But he has grand ambitions. Today, there are 14 million customers using the MoonPay payments platform. Armed with largely untested web3-focused infrastructure in the form of HyperMint and the web3 passport, the company hopes to connect those millions of people to big brands\u2019 NFT projects \u2014 which it also hopes to have a hand in creating.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe envision a world where we can bridge our customers with the experiences that we\u2019re building with the leading web3 brands,\u201D said Soto-Wright. \u201CThe best analogy is we\u2019re becoming more like an American Express.\u201D<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
