However, this may be more challenging for node operators, with hardware requirements around twice as large compared to the main Ethereum blockchain.","Rather than simply cloning the Ethereum codebase, Monad <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/211352\/monad-labs-funding-blockchain-former-jump-trading-developers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">says<\/a> it\u2019s building a new EVM from the ground up, using a pipelined architecture. This staggered approach, rather than carrying out each process one after the other, enables more efficient processing and instant block finality. Monad is also bytecode compatible, making it simple for Ethereum developers to port their existing decentralized applications to the blockchain.","The mon token will be used to pay for transactions to be included within blocks, known as a carriage cost, and for transactions to be executed, according to Monad's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252757\/monad-token-name\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">technical documents<\/a> released in September. However, Monad later removed the token name from the documents for unspecified reasons.","Monad Labs was co-founded by former Jump Trading developers.

We're excited to share our team's advances in parallel EVM execution and performant state access later this year,\" he said.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with comment from Keone Hon.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["ETHEREUM"]}
