There is no legitimate investment need for retail consumers to invest in these products, said the regulator. Hacks, inadequate understanding, and cryptocurrencies\u2019 \u201Cno reliable basis for valuation\u201D are some other listed reasons for the ban.","\u201CThis ban reflects how seriously we view the potential harm to retail consumers in these products,\" said Sheldon Mills, interim executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA. \"Consumer protection is paramount here.\"","The ban will come into effect on January 6, 2021. The FCA estimates that retail consumers will save around £53 million (~$68 million) from the ban on these products.","The FCA's action will not only impact crypto derivative exchanges, but also crypto brokers, investment platforms, and financial advisers.","\"If your firm carries out marketing, distribution or selling activities in, or from, the UK of the relevant products to retail clients, you are required to cease these activities by 6 January 2021,\" said the FCA in a separate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fca.org.uk\/publication\/policy\/ps20-10.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">policy statement<\/a>. \"Retail consumers with existing holdings can remain invested following the prohibition, until they choose to disinvest.

Unfortunately, the FCA ignored those reasons (or dismissed them with little additional information).\"","Lansing said the ban on these ETNs would not result in the proposed savings and benefits. \"Rather, it will simply drive U.K. retail investors to unregulated crypto exchanges, which, as the FCA itself admits, have far fewer protections than the regulated ETNs offered by CoinShares and other providers.\"","According to Lansing, the timing of the ban is also \"unfortunate.\" He said other jurisdictions are now opening up to the crypto sector, such as the European Commission recently proposed regulatory regime for digital assets. \"We find it difficult to see how the U.K. can be seen as welcoming of digital asset innovation when it is the only Western jurisdiction to ban them based on an erroneous belief that they have 'no intrinsic value,'\" said Lansing.","Danny Scott, co-founder and CEO of U.K.-based crypto exchange CoinCorner told The Block that the ban doesn't affect \"bitcoin exchanges like ourselves, but it will affect companies such as Revolut and eToro that offer a CFD [contract for differences] rather than the asset itself.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nA Revolut spokesperson told The Block that the ban does not impact the firm as it does not offer CFDs\/derivatives or ETNs. \"Our customers own the crypto and we buy on their behalf,\" the spokesperson said.&nbsp;&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This story has been updated to include comments from CoinShares, CoinCorner, and Revolut executives.&nbsp;<\/em>","© 2023 The Block.
