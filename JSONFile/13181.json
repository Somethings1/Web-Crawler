This manifests in allowing artists to pool all their works together on one platform, regardless of where those pieces were created, and by handing them total control over royalties.","Founded in 2022 by former employees of Instagram and Walmart, FirstMate has so far rolled out marketplaces on behalf of Bankless, Gmoney\u2019s 9dcc, FELT Zine, Sound.xyz and others. Its marketplaces currently support over one thousand collections, spanning everything from generative art to luxury clothing.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
