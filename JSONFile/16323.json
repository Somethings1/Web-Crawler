She also said Anchorage clients \"can move their assets within minutes of transaction approval.\"","Explaining the origin of the idea, the Anchor Labs founders wrote that digital asset funds had come to them requesting assistance managing their private keys securely:","Without providing much in the way of detail, Mónica and McCauley added that Anchorage \"applies the world\u2019s most advanced and proven digital security architecture to better support institutional investments, while enabling active on-chain participation that offline cold storage historically hasn\u2019t allowed.\"","Bringing in institutions through new custody solutions can grow the blockchain space, both through an influx of funding and by forming the basis for \"a rich and mature financial ecosystem,\" they wrote.","\"The bull run of 2017 proved that crypto assets have tremendous potential value, and the backslide of 2018 showed us that the financial system surrounding those assets is far from maturity,\" the post noted, adding:","Vault door image via Shutterstock"],"entity":[{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Max Levchin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Khosla Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nathan McCauley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Diogo Mónica","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Docker","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\"Anchorage","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Anchorage","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"McCauley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Naval Ravikant","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shutterstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Blackrock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andreessen Horowitz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$17 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mark McCombe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Elad Gil","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mónica","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["News","Custody","Anchor Labs","Anchorage","business news"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De"]}
