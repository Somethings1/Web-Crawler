The goal of the fund is to \u201Chelp build the ownership economy,\u201D according to an accompanying <a href=\"https:\/\/variant.fund\/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blog post<\/a> published Tuesday<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. Sources say the fund has drawn in somewhere south of $20 million in commitments as of today, although Walden declined to comment on the amount.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Part and parcel to that vision, according to Walden, is a focus on decentralized marketplaces. And Variant intends to devote its resources to startups led by product-driven founders.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That concept of ownership \u2014 control by the users and stakeholders, rather than of<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">them \u2014 form a key strut of Variant\u2019s investment thesis. As Walden wrote: \u201CAs user participation becomes evermore mainstream and complex, the next step is platforms that are not only built, operated and funded by users \u2014 but owned by users too.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Walden went on to write:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COwnership is a powerful motivator for users to contribute to products in deeper ways, be it with ideas, computing resources, code, or community building. This more cooperative economic model helps ensure better alignment with users over time, resulting in platforms that can be larger, more resilient, and more innovative. This is the Ownership Economy, and beyond being a positive social endeavor, the platforms building it are able to leverage the strongest form of market incentives to grow network effects.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Of course, building such an economy isn\u2019t an overnight endeavor, but it\u2019s one that Variant and its founder see as a long-term investment opportunity. And the actions of market incumbents like Uber, Airbnb and even platforms like OnlyFans provide important lessons both positive and negative.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In conversation with The Block, Walden pointed to the tokenization of products, a process that provides digital linkages connecting creators with their work.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe ownership economy doesn\u2019t always mean a literal distribution of tokens, stock options, or equity. It also doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that an application or service is entirely built on a blockchain,\u201D Warren wrote in the blog post. \u201CRather, it means that ownership \u2014 which may manifest in the form of novel economic rewards, platform governance, or new forms of social capital \u2014 can be a new keystone of user experiences, with plenty of design space to explore.\u201D<\/span>"],"hashtag":[]}
