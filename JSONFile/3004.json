And according to co-founder Rory Felton, the updated version will aim to avoid the same copyright issues that the beta version faced.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HitPiece's beta launch caused a stir among musical recording artists who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/132866\/music-nft-marketplace-hitpiece-slammed-for-selling-music-assets-without-artist-permission\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claimed<\/a> that their work appeared on the platform without their knowledge or permission. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HitPiece eventually decided to take down its beta web page.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Felton told The Block that it learned from the community feedback and made improvements to the platform, which the firm wants to become the go-to place for music NFTs.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Felton, there was no music on the HitPiece beta platform at all, and that the startup would never sell music without the proper commercial rights. It was intended to be a private experience built on a private blockchain, he said. Nothing was decentralized or could be sold on a third-party marketplace.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Nonetheless, artists saw their work on HitPiece and claimed it had been minted as NFTs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/132866\/music-nft-marketplace-hitpiece-slammed-for-selling-music-assets-without-artist-permission\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">without their permission<\/a>.

So we took that beta down and rebuilt a product that we think makes sense for the marketplace and for artists.\u201D<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Five months later, as it launches to the general public, HitPiece is prioritizing ownership rights and benefiting the artists who use the platform. <\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Felton said the partnership with Audible Magic, which the firm announced on Wednesday, reflects that emphasis. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe partnered with [Audible Magic] because we think it's important that only owners and rights holders mint NFT containing that music.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Audible Magic contains over 100 million songs from over 400,000 record labels, as of 2021. Artists and rights holders will need to register on HitPiece, verify their identity and then have their uploaded content checked against Audible Magic\u2019s database to ensure that no copyright rules will be broken by minting an NFT.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HitPiece will also cover the transaction fees and minting costs for artists who use the platform. The platform might not cover gas and mint fees forever, however, according to Felton.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Felton, a longtime music lover, co-founded HitPiece in 2020 with Jeff Burn<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ingham, an early investor in Spotify. \u201CIt became clear to me that there were opportunities for music artists who take advantage of the space to generate new revenue streams and connect with their fans in new ways in the metaverse,\u201D said Felton.<\/span>","\"In music, Web3 has significant potential to be a catalyst for increasing artistic integrity, control and engagement for any musician, no matter their reach,\u201D musician ATL Jacob in a statement associated with the platform's launch.
