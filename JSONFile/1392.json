Underpinning that froth was a surge in lending activities, supercharged by active traders seeking leverage to make large bets on coins.","In one case, Genesis Global Capital, owned by Digital Currency Group, originated $131 billion in loans for the year \u2014 seven times more than in 2020. During the third quarter, Genesis originated $8.4 billion in new loans, down 80% from the previous period. The firm is now verging on bankruptcy following last year's credit crunch stemming from the meltdown of Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda and FTX.","Crypto's credit crisis was underpinned by a lack of diversity in counterparties and parameters that would give traders a better sense of their counterparties' risk, Diogo Monica, co-founder of crypto financial services provider Anchorage, said.","In traditional finance, \u201Csince there\u2019s more counterparties \u2026 you end up not having huge risk,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd in fact, there\u2019s a lot of rules and regulations that make you give enough data so that you can actually judge what other people\u2019s positions are at other prime brokers. None of that exists in crypto. It\u2019s all the same people.\u201D","The desire to draw upon the principles of traditional finance was echoed by SwissBorg\u2019s Cyrus Fazel, who said that the market \u201Cshould take what was in asset management, what was in banking, and power it with many institutions in crypto.\u201D","Fazel, Monica and fellow panelist David Olsson of Kraken agreed that decentralized lending could also play a larger role in the crypto credit market.","Olsson, who recently joined Kraken to lead its prime finance business, said that the crypto exchange could draw upon pools of decentralized credit from protocols like Aave and Compound.","\u201CThere is a model where you can have a two-speed solution where we could do certain lending for a client on balance sheet ... and then if there are risks that we are not comfortable with as an institution \u2026 we could participate in a DeFi protocol,\" Olsson said.","DeFi lending for institutions will have to be permissioned, Olsson said, noting that institutional investors need \u201Ca lot of hand-holding and human intelligence around \u2026 red flags that are outside the world of pure protocol and computational power.\u201D","\u201CThat\u2019s going to be the way it is 30 years from now,\" Olsson said.","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
