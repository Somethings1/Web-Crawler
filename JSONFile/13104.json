Suski then later opted into a separate \"officials rules\" for the sweepstakes, which included a clause that California courts would have \"exclusive jurisdiction over any controversies regarding the sweepstakes,\" according to Kim's opinion.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase argued that the user agreement should have superseded the official rules, but the California judge ultimately disagreed.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It is unusual to have a company end up having two cases teed up in front of the U.S. Supreme Court two terms in a row, said Jessica Lynn Ellsworth, outside counsel for Coinbase with law firm Hogan Lovells US, LLP. The U.S. Supreme Court came to a decision in June to pause litigation involving <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/opinions\/22pdf\/22-105_5536.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Abraham Bielski<\/a> while the lower courts decide whether the case belongs in arbitration or in court.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"They don't take a huge number of cases and they don't take a huge number of cases involving commercial business interests,\" Ellsworth said.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Next, the case will likely be argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court some time in spring 2024.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
