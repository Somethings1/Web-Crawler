Most likely, we\u2019ll have to retreat in many countries. I think the UK \u2014 we\u2019ll have to exit very soon. We recently exited France,\u201D Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, explained.","The Financial Conduct Authority <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fca.org.uk\/news\/press-releases\/fca-sets-expectations-ahead-incoming-crypto-marketing-rules#:~:text=From%208%20October%2C%20UK%20consumers,inappropriately%20incentivise%20people%20to%20invest.\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">will, on Oct. 8, enforce new rules<\/a> \u2014 which include a cooling-off period for first-time investors \u2014 that it hopes will make the marketing of crypto products more transparent and more accurate.","Zhou said the new rules will change the way solicitation works. Although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/article\/80943\/crypto-derivatives-uk-ban-defi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto derivative products have been banned in the UK since 2021<\/a>, some exchanges have nonetheless been able to serve UK customers via reverse solicitation. That could all change on Oct. 8.","\u201CFCA has explicitly contacted all the major players \u2014 us, OKX, Binance, everyone \u2014 and asked what our plan is to deal with this new law. And the new law is that if you use English as a language, they will see you as trying to solicit their users, so you cannot claim that you are in reverse solicitation,\u201D Zhou said. \u201CEveryone is in trouble. So everyone is thinking of plans for how to deal with this new law.\u201D","For Bybit, the most likely consequence is that the exchange simply cuts ties with the UK altogether, Zhou added. &nbsp;","George Morris, a partner at Simmons &amp; Simmons, said the promotions regime has been in force for securities firms for decades \u2014&nbsp;but is now expanding to encapsulate crypto firms. &nbsp;","\u201CThe rules are extremely complicated and they\u2019re quite wide-ranging,\u201D said Morris, adding that even having a website that\u2019s accessible by UK customers could, from Oct. 8, be construed as a promotion. \u201CIt\u2019s not just UK firms that are subject to these rules \u2014 anyone with a website that can be accessed in the UK is subject to these requirements.\u201D","Founded in 2018 as a derivatives-focused exchange, Bybit has, in recent years, branched out into a range of other products, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/111453\/crypto-derivatives-exchange-bybit-spot-trading-xrp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">including spot trading<\/a>.
