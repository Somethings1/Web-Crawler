Part of this includes the Wild Residency, an application-based virtual residency program where artists are paired with advisers over 12 weeks for a crash course on creating NFT art. At the end of the program, the artists release collections, sold via auction on the platform.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Expecting an artist to be able to do it all on their own is a lot \u2014 from creating the work itself to promoting it, marketing it, branding it \u2014 there\u2019s so much that goes into creating work and being able to leverage the experience, knowledge and network of fellow artists is invaluable,\" said Kobs, noting that those new to the space can find it overwhelming.&nbsp;<\/span>","Along with the residency, Wild offers an NFT membership pass named Wild Oasis which grants holders early access to artist drops and auctions at fixed floor prices. While 399 of those 1,000 passes have been <a href=\"https:\/\/wild.xyz\/oasis\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">minted<\/a> so far, the first 300 were distributed to artists taking part in its inaugural residency cohort, advisers, investors and the founding team.&nbsp;","The startup will use the funding to further build out its residency and invest in infrastructure to power its experiential art. Many of Wild's collections can be accessed through in-browser experiences without needing to connect a wallet.&nbsp;","Wild's funding round comes at a time when investor interest in the NFT art market is showing some signs of recovery. Between Feb. 19 and Feb. 26, close to 18,000 art and collectible NFTs were sold on the Ethereum blockchain, according to data collected by The Block Research. While that's a far cry from its peak in the final week of August 2021 \u2014 when close to 30,000 pieces of NFT art were sold \u2014 it's a significant improvement over the final quarter of last year when weekly sales barely tallied 7,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/art-collectibles\/ethereum-art-and-collectibles-nft-sales\/embed\" title=\"Ethereum Art and Collectibles NFT Sales\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","The rebound could also have been influenced by floundering floor prices of key NFT collections, no longer able to garner the high price tags they once did during the bull market.
