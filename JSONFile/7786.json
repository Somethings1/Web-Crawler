Bagel Network argues that a disproportionate amount of data in the machine learning niche is owned and controlled by large entities, making it more difficult for smaller organizations to create high-quality ML models.","The project plans to resolve this by creating a marketplace where data scientists and AI engineers can collaboratively exchange and license verifiable datasets in a cost-effective and privacy-preserving manner, according to a statement.","\u201CAt Bagel Network, we envision a future where high-quality, machine learning data is trustlessly accessible to both humans and artificial intelligence,\u201D Bagel Network founder Bidhan Roy said in the statement. Roy has over a decade of experience as a software engineer for major tech companies, specifically in data and machine learning, and previously worked as a project lead for Amazon\u2019s Alexa machine learning team.","Bagel Network plans to use the funds to bolster operations, grow its current team of five, continue its research and development efforts, and further expand its data ecosystem, Roy told The Block.","Roy identified Bagel Network\u2019s main competitors as web2 incumbents like HuggingFace, Kaggle, and Pinecone \u2014 aiming to utilize blockchain and zero-knowledge cryptography to target the mainstream machine learning and AI space. While Bagel Network has already begun onboarding data partners, Roy mentioned it was unable to reveal them at this time due to legal aspects still in progress.","The platform is being designed to operate as a standalone chain. Data providers post zero-knowledge commitments to the on-chain marketplace, which verifies the integrity of the initial dataset and tracks changes \u2014 similar to how GitHub works, Roy told The Block. The quality of the datasets is determined by a combination of the free market and Bagel Network\u2019s reputation mechanisms, backed by staked tokens, he said.","\u201CThe platform's trustless mechanisms and horizontal scalability allow autonomous AI agents to join and learn specific skills for task performance,\u201D Roy said. \u201CWe anticipate that activity from these agents will constitute a substantial portion of the platform's overall activity.\u201D","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
