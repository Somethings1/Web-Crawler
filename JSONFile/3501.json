There are a lot of mental challenges especially in doing all of this stuff safely and making sure all of the circuits are correct. Optimistic rollup technology is just more mature,\" he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While ZK-Rollups are faster, one thing that ZK-Rollups lack is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making them hard to run decentralized applications like DeFi protocols. The EVM is the main processing unit on the Ethereum blockchain for decentralized applications.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But this may change soon since EVM compatibility for ZK-Rollups is in the works. Layer 2 projects <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">like Scroll, zkSync and Polygon have announced plans to introduce a compute environment called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/158635\/polygon-is-helping-to-bring-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-to-zk-rollups\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">zk-EVM<\/a> that will allow ZK-Rollups to independently run all types of general-purpose smart contracts.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Buterin added, \"We've actually been starting to see zk-EVM implementations that are almost ready to scale with Ethereum transactions, which is amazing.\"<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
