The 1981-1982 recession saw close to 11 percent unemployment at its height.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n","","Investment bank Morgan Stanley had predicted that jobless claims numbers would land between 2 to 4 million, an increase that led to its economists to adjust their original forecast on a recessionary outcome.&nbsp;","\"Looking out a month or so, our economists predict an unemployment rate north of 10%, which would exceed the rate experienced during the Great Recession,\" a group of analysts at the bank wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.","The bank said the pace at which coronavirus-tied social-distancing and wide-spread business closure has impacted the economy explains recent stock market performance.","\"Markets always move ahead of the data,\" the bank's analysts noted. Still, the possibility for a quick V-shaped recovery offers one silver lining.&nbsp;","\"The question at this point is, will the recovery be just as fast,\" they wrote. \"We think there is a strong argument for, rather than against, a fast recovery at least over the next 6 months.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
