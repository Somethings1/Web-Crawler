Through Spark, users can obtain DAI loans using assets such as ether (ETH), staked ether (stETH), and DAI. Spark functions independently from MakerDAO's primary mechanism, which solely permits users to generate new DAI as overcollateralized debt.","\"Spark Protocol's first version, Spark Lend, is a lending marketplace specifically designed for supplying and borrowing crypto with a focus on DAI,\" MakerDAO <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MakerDAO\/status\/1655575092124958726\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a>.

The lending platform incorporates a tailored interest rate model, wherein borrowing rates are established by governance members through on-chain voting, instead of fluctuating according to supply and demand as found in Aave or other lending protocols.","Spark will integrate with MakerDAO's Peg Stability Module, enabling instant conversion of DAI to USDC at a 1:1 ratio for users seeking stablecoin swaps. The creation of Spark was led by Phoenix Labs, a contributing firm to MakerDAO.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
