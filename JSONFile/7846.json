Collectively, these vehicles manage 1,008,436 BTC or 5.13% of bitcoin's circulating supply as of Mar. 4, K33 said.","\"Crossing one million bitcoins under management in investment vehicles is a monumental threshold,\" Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33, told The Block. \"These vehicles have shaken up the bitcoin market structure considerably. A few years ago, spot exchanges held 20% of the circulating supply; now, this figure has fallen to 11%, with ETFs\/ETPs, wrapped bitcoin, and a developing derivatives market eating away market share.\"","The push beyond one million BTC in investment vehicles \"should be an eye-opener for OG bitcoiners that ETFs have become a significant factor in bitcoin's price discovery,\" Lunde added.","","","Of the more than 1 million BTC, nearly 700,000 BTC are under management solely by the recently launched spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., according to <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/unfolded\/17297\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Glassnode data.<\/a>","Since debuting in January of this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/learn\/272940\/what-is-a-spot-bitcoin-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs<\/a> are already in a race to beat gold ETFs, which have been operational since 2004. The combined assets under management of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have reached over $52.5 billion as of Mar. 4, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bitmexresearch\/status\/1764914385737138376?s=46&amp;t=v4MeJk18PFydz-g2BpdAVg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BitMEX Research data<\/a>, while gold ETFs boast a total AUM of over $100 billion.","As for flows, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows totaling $7.9 billion since their launch on Jan. 11, per BitMEX data.","On Mar. 4, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows worth over $562 million, with Fidelity's FBTC fund itself contributing a record inflow of over $404 million, according to BitMEX data.
