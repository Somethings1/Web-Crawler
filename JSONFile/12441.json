According to SFC, digital assets are at risk of volatility, hacking and fraud\u2014and the regulator warns security tokens are not exempt from those risks.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Security tokens are asset-backed tokens that use blockchain technology, similarly to other crypto assets. They represent the ownership of assets like precious metals or real estate or are tied to economic rights, such as shares. At the moment, most security tokens are not offered to the general public but only to professional investors, requiring large initial investments.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SFC reminds token issuers that Security Tokens are usually recognised as securities under Securities and Futures Ordinance. Therefore, they are subject to Hong Kong\u2019s securities laws. The regulator also points out that a license is required to be able to deal in securities\u2014and it affects both investors operating in Hong Kong and those dealing with Hong Kong investors. Those who fail to comply, unless exempted, may face criminal offense charges.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SFC also advises intermediaries to keep in mind three key issues: relevant licensing and registration, due diligence, and clear information for their clients.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhere an intermediary markets or distributes Security Tokens, it must be licensed or registered for Type 1 regulated activity (dealing in securities) and the Security Tokens should only be offered to professional investors,\u201D SFC writes.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moreover, those who decide to distribute securities are required to proper due diligence. According to SFC, in order to learn about STOs and gain in-depth knowledge, an intermediary should at the very least scrutinise \u201Cthe background and financial soundness of the management, development team and issuer as well as the existence of and rights attached to the assets which back the Security Tokens.\u201D It is also on them to analyse the issuer\u2019s white paper and any other materials referring to the STO in order not to mislead their clients.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Clients should obtain \u201Cclear and easily comprehensible\u201D information regarding the STOs. Otherwise, if prospective investors receive unclear knowledge, they might not be able to make informed decisions. SFC also reminds about providing clients with warning statements regarding the risks associated with digital assets.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
