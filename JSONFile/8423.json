His personal crypto wallet was compromised, losing $1.7 million in NFTs and cryptocurrency. What wasn\u2019t reported is that a second wallet was also <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/token\/0x5a98fcbea516cf06857215779fd812ca3bef1b32?a=0x48acf41d10a063f9a6b718b9aad2e2ff5b319ca2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">compromised<\/a>, initially losing more than 200,000 Lido tokens ($720,000) of money belonging to the firm.","And worse: it contained a further 3.7 million of vested Lido tokens, worth $13.3 million, that were steadily getting unlocked \u2014 which either the hacker or DeFiance Capital could transfer out of the wallet, whoever got there first.","The vesting did, however, provide some respite. Even though the hacker had access to the staked Lido tokens, they could not sell them all because they were locked in a \u2018linear vesting\u2019 contract. Linear vesting is a system in which crypto protocol holds funds for a scheduled period and a tiny amount is released with each new block.&nbsp;","Only a small number of Lido tokens kept getting unlocked at a time. Cheong told The Block that it used flashbots \u2014 a messaging protocol that can enable you to get priority when making transactions \u2014 to <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x48acf41d10a063f9a6b718b9aad2e2ff5b319ca2#tokentxns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rescue<\/a> most of the funds that were getting unlocked.","In an effort to stop the bleeding, a representative from DeFiance Capital by the name of \u2018jacob.defiance\u2019 made a <a href=\"https:\/\/mainnet.lido.fi\/#\/lido-dao\/0x2e59a20f205bb85a89c53f1936454680651e618e\/vote\/119\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">governance proposal<\/a> to the Lido DAO community on voting platform Aragon. As discussed on Lido\u2019s governance forum, they <a href=\"https:\/\/research.lido.fi\/t\/proposal-to-freeze-vesting-for-compromised-address\/1864\/15\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposed<\/a> to burn the vested Lido tokens and mint them to a new wallet in the fund\u2019s control.","On Wednesday, Lido DAO members voted to pass the proposal, following which the team <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0x209e9ef26e4847cfe70c8d052f0771a031f2d47461b05a76565ce36d34d9e929\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">burned<\/a> the entire sum of vested tokens. The tokens will now be returned to the fund's control.","So in all, Cheong and the fund lost more than $2.42 million but saved a further $13.3 million from getting stolen, a small silver lining.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This story has been updated to show that DeFiance Capital managed to rescue most of the funds that were in the process of getting unlocked rather than the hacker.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
