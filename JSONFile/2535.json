We don\u2019t do consultancy. But there's a small fund on back of this thing and we've made some investments in zero-knowledge infrastructure companies,\u201D Thomas Walton-Pocock, formerly CEO and cofounder at Aztec Network, told The Block.","Prior to its official launch, Geometry led a $4 million seed investment round for Israel-based zero-knowledge semiconductor company Ingonyama. It was also a participant in the seed and Series A rounds for Ethereum layer-two network Scroll, and led the seed round for Soap Labs, which is aiming to bring cross-venue liquidity to the NFT market.","\u201CWe are also running a program for researchers in&nbsp;residence for&nbsp;highly ambitious people who want to come and spend time in a cryptography or deep mathematics rich setting. Typically they will be engineers&nbsp;- but by no means always&nbsp;-&nbsp;and want to build&nbsp;a&nbsp;company based off some corner of this industry,\u201D Walton-Pocock said.","Developed in the 1980s, zero-knowledge proofs are a way of verifying information without being given access to the entire information set. It has been touted as a way of addressing scalability issues on blockchains.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
