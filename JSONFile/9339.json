Ltd, v. John Doe, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29616 (D. W.D.Wash., C19\u201392-RAJ, 2\/25\/2019) [SDP]<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/strong><\/em>","Way back in January we covered ZG Top Technology v. John Doe, a case that involves a Mongolian Blockchain company that says its purloined cryptocurrency is being held by the Bittrex exchange. John Doe lawsuits provide a way to sue people who you don\u2019t know and then use litigation tools to find \u2019em and then hopefully get your stuff back. A month later, we have our first ruling in the case, which addresses precisely this\u200A\u2014\u200Aan \u201Cex parte\u201D motion to do immediate discovery.","What does ex parte mean? In plain English it means that the other side doesn\u2019t have a chance to respond. Kinda makes sense in a John Doe lawsuit, right? After all, it\u2019s hard to notify an unknown person that you want to do discovery to find out who they are.","Usually in U.S. federal courts you\u2019re not allowed to do discovery until you have \u201Cconferred\u201D with the other litigants. It\u2019s an organizational thing imposed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but there are cases when a Court will allow exceptions and one is (like here) \u201Cfor the limited purpose of identifying \u2018Doe\u2019 defendants on whom process cannot otherwise be served.\u201D","Here, the Court says it will allow ZG Top to seek \u201Cexpedited discovery\u201D from Bittrex, including \u201Cthe name, street address, telephone number and e-mail address of John Doe.\u201D Bittrex will be required to give the affected user a copy of the subpoena and they will have 30 days from service to object. However, the Court said it wouldn\u2019t allow other forms discovery\u200A\u2014\u200Aincluding subpoenas on other unnamed parties because \u201Cgood cause\u201D for that wasn\u2019t shown. It also looks like the plaintiff may have been seeking some sort of early, pre-judgment asset freeze and the Court was not inclined to permit that either.","Bottom line, and this really shouldn\u2019t be a surprise\u200A\u2014\u200Aif you take purloined crypto and send it to a U.S. exchange that does AML\/KYC and knows who you are, the person who you took it from can track you down pretty easily.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
