Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-CA) write that a FINRA survey disclosed that 70% of brokers\u2019 communications with retail investors violated fair disclosure rules.","\u201CBrokers\u2019 communications falsely equated cryptocurrency with cash; in others, they provided misleading explanations of cryptocurrency\u2019s risks,\u201D they wrote. \u201CThese alarming deficiencies raise significant concerns that brokers and advisers may now provide incomplete and deceptive information about bitcoin ETPs to retail investors.\u201D","The Senators also argue that by naming bitcoin exchange-traded funds as such, the name \u201Cobfuscates important characteristics about these investments.\u201D","\u201CRetail investors should be made aware of how these ETPs differ from more common funds which they may have experience,\u201D they said in the letter, writing that bitcoin is not subject to the same protections under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that ETFs which hold shares of various companies would have.","The two lawmakers also say that bitcoin (BTC) \u2013 which they call the most established and scrutinized cryptocurrency \u2013 is displaying weakness, and other cryptos are far more susceptible to misconduct.","\u201CWe do not believe that other cryptocurrencies show the trading volumes or integrity to support associated ETPs,\u201D they wrote. \u201CRetail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs\u2026whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes.\u201D","\u201CRespectfully, Senators, the evidence points exactly the opposite way,\u201D Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal wrote in a post on X.","Grewal pointed out that ether (ETH), thought to be the next digital asset to have an ETF, has a higher trading volume than many S&P 500 stocks.","\u201CETH\u2019s spot market is deep and liquid,\u201D he wrote. \u201COnly one S&P 500 stock has lower adjusted bid-ask spreads,\u201D Grewal added that Coinbase had addressed the senators\u2019 concerns when it sent a 27-page comment letter to the SEC.","\u201CCrypto is an important building block in updating our financial system for everyone,\u201D he concluded.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"Jack Reed","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1940","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Laphonza Butler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grewal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"R.I.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FINRA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Paul Grewal","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Senators","Senate","Paul grewal","Bitcoin ETF","Crypto ETPs","Democratic Party","SEC","Securities and Exchange Commission"],"authors":["Sam Reynolds"]}
