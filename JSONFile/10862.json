Mostly, however, illicit money traveling through DeFi originated in DeFi hacks. Bad actors seldom used DeFi as a means for laundering external money; instead, they turned to Bitcoin.","The biggest source of illicit funding remained fairly typical <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/115858\/russian-pyramid-scheme-netted-over-1-5-billion-in-bitcoin-throughout-eastern-europe-says-chainalysis\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">scams aimed at collecting crypto<\/a>.","\u201CThis dataset is very conservative, so these are all investigated crimes,\u201D Grauer explained, detailing that it took more than general suspicion to be included in the report. It is perhaps for this reason that the firm identified money laundering as \"just 0.05% of all cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021.\"","Moreover, almost all of the data related to \"cryptocurrency-native\" crime, rather than offline crime converted into cryptocurrency to be laundered. The dataset also did not include privacy tokens like Monero, which remain resistant to this sort of analysis.","Holding true throughout the years is that a surprising amount of illicit money still goes through a small roster of 5 major centralized crypto exchanges. Chainalysis' most recent report did not name those exchanges, nor would Grauer, but a similar study in 2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/53138\/chainalysis-traced-2-8-billion-in-bitcoin-being-sent-to-crypto-exchanges-by-criminals-last-year\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">named Binance and Huobi<\/a>.&nbsp;","A major <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/106282\/ofac-blockchain-analytics-tools-chainalysis\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">contractor for the U.S. government<\/a> as well as for crypto platforms worldwide, Chainalysis saw its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/109515\/chainalysis-valuation-hits-4-2-billion-after-100-million-series-e-fundraise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">valuation exceed $4 billion<\/a> in a 2021 funding round.","© 2023 The Block.
