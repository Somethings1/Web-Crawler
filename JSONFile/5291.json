The surge came amid further regulatory crackdowns in the U.S., with regulators going after Paxos for its BUSD issuance. The week before saw BTC price action flat for the most part as the Securities and Exchange Commission cracked down on Kraken\u2019s crypto staking plans.","Bitcoin\u2019s breaking $25,000 was the high point of the week. BTC gained 10% between Wednesday and Thursday, with its positive price action spurring gains across the board as major tokens like ETH, ADA, and MATIC recorded double-digit gains during the week.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin price action this week.

The pullback happened after BTC was unable to move beyond local resistance at the $25,200 price level.","Stock prices of publicly traded crypto companies were also mostly in the green this past week. MicroStrategy rallied 22%, adding $53 to its stock price before ending the week trading at $294.","Coinbase rose 17% to close out at $65.20.
