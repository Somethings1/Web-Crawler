Elizabeth Warren (D\u2013Mass.) has called out the crypto industry yet again, saying they are reluctant to follow the rules.","\"I wanna collaborate with the industry, what I don't understand is why the industry seems to be saying that they only way that they can survive is if there's plenty of space for the drug traffickers and the human traffickers, oh and the terrorist, and the ransomware scammer, and the consumer scammers,\" said Warren in an interview with Bloomberg Television.","Warren said that in the U.S. financial system, everybody follows the same rules and crypto needs to fall in line with those rules.","The Democrat referred to her \u201CDigital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act\u201D bill, which would bring anti-money-laundering requirements to various crypto players, including miners, validators, wallet providers and others.","The staunchly anti-crypto senator introduced the bill last year and initially garnered some support.
