The same goes, of course, for Ethereum and every crypto protocol spawned after it. If the aforementioned projections are correct, the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry will enter a new, distinct and defined chapter of existence.","The uncertain and fluid economic policy for fiat currencies has come into even sharper contrast with the fixed, mathematics-based \"tokenomics\" of major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for example, has a set amount of new coins minted every block \u2014 with an ultimate supply cap of 21 million coins. (Though many have already been permanently lost, making the real total supply effectively smaller).","\"The current macroeconomic situation is precisely the environment Bitcoin is meant to thrive in,\" Hunain Naseer, head of content at COIN360 told The Block. \"It is purpose-built to withstand the kind of arbitrary controls that are wreaking havoc on fiat currencies around the world.\"","Ethereum's economics, meanwhile, have stolen the spotlight following its high-profile move from an energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism to the more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake, which was dubbed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177704\/five-key-ways-the-merge-affected-the-ethereum-blockchain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The Merge.\"<\/a>","The supply growth of ether has declined to -0.04% over the past 30 days, according to tracker ultrasound.money, making it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179144\/ethereum-token-supply-on-trend-to-drop-below-pre-merge-levels\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">deflationary<\/a> over that span. Proponents of the second-ranked crypto protocol have already expressed excitement over ether's deflationary potential in periods of increased demand \u2014 such as a future bull market.","On-chain volume for Ethereum is in a general decline.

The question many pundits are asking revolves around how much further the central bank can push interest rates before putting too much strain on economic growth.","More hawkishness from the Fed may not portend positive price action for cryptocurrency investors \u2014 but blocks will continue to be produced while transparent and math-based economics will remain in play.","Â© 2023 The Block.
