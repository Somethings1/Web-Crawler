By allowing developers to build web3 games using existing and widespread gaming engines,&nbsp; the company says this will help speed up blockchain games, which are prone to lags.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The platform empowers studios to incorporate immutable digital assets into their games, resulting in powerful new experiences for gamers,\" said founding partner of CMCC Charlie Morris in a release.<\/span>","The project will funnel the funding into further integration with other leading game engines and invest in supporting teams that deploy their games and products on the Ajuna network. Along with the funding round, it's also debuting its first iteration of a collectible NFT-powered game Awesome Ajuna Avatars.&nbsp;","Ajuna's backing follows a flurry of funding for projects in the NFTs and gaming subsector \u2014 the most <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/research\/january-blockchain-funding-recap-209442\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">popular subsector<\/a> in terms of percentage of total funding since August 2021, according to The Block Research. Last month, crypto gaming platform Oh Baby Games <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/206950\/oh-baby-games-comes-out-of-stealth-announcing-6-million-funding-round\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> a $6 million seed round as it emerged from stealth. In the same month, Neopets Meta, the web3 version of the popular virtual pet game, also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/203724\/neopets-meta-raises-4m-in-funding-from-polygon-ventures-blizzard-avalanche\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a>&nbsp;a $4 million round.","","","Still, January saw deals in the subsector <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/research\/january-blockchain-funding-recap-209442\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">decline<\/a> from 40% in December to 26% but as The Block Research's John Dantoni points out, it's still premature to suggest that it's lost its appeal to crypto investors, citing previous lulls that led the way to pickups in funding.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
