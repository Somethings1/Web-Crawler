While firms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/47574\/galaxy-digital-takes-another-swing-at-crypto-asset-management-but-the-landscape-is-more-competitive-than-ever\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Galaxy Digital<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/van-eck-solidx-to-offer-limited-version-of-bitcoin-exchange-traded-fund-11567503003\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">VanEck<\/a> have recently rolled out similarly structured funds, the new fund intends to invest only in cash-settled futures, which addresses regulatory concerns regarding potential market manipulation and has won it a personal endorsement from SEC official Dalia Blass.","Stone Ridge Trust VI <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/41920\/a-new-bitcoin-futures-fund-has-been-filed-with-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> the registration statement for the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund in October. After two subsequent amendments, the registration went into effect on Monday. According to an NYDIG spokesperson, the fund is the first to be approved by the SEC.&nbsp;","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.stoneridgefunds.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stone Ridge Funds<\/a>, a subsidiary of Stone Ridge Holdings Group targeted at institutional clients with long-term horizons, will act as the new fund\u2019s investment advisor, according to the filings. By Aug. 30, the group has managed approximately $15 billion worth of assets.","The new fund is \u201Ca non-diversified, closed-end management investment company,\u201D the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1764894\/000119312519301050\/d693146dn2a.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filings<\/a> say. Its shares are not listed on any exchange and only institutional traders can invest at a price of $10 per share. Shareholders may not sell or repurchase their shares on a daily basis but can only periodically sell portions of their shares back to the fund. This feature is designed to only draw in long-term investors with sustainable investment goals and relatively high-risk tolerance. Furthermore, the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund will not directly invest in digital assets like Bitcoin, the filings claim but will focus on investing in bitcoin futures contracts.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Prime example\"<\/strong>","The new fund came as a result of the SEC\u2019s recent effort to engage the fund industry in conversations about investor protection, according to last week\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/blass-keynote-address-2019-ici-securities-law-developments-conference\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">speech<\/a> by Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Investment Management, Dalia Blass.","In her speech, Blass gave the agency\u2019s rationale for supporting the fund. Firstly, the fund will only invest in cash-settled futures, which will mitigate the risks and challenges involved in direct holdings of digital assets. Secondly, since the fund is a closed-end interval fund that does not offer daily redemptions, it will not suffer from large, short-term liquidity demands by market makers and its price will remain relatively stable. Moreover, the fund has taken measures to prevent potential manipulation, including offering substantive risk disclosures, recruiting only registered investment advisers, and setting an initial cap of $25 million to limit the fund's size and growth trajectory. At the same time, however, she emphasized that \u201Cno investment products are absolutely risk-free,\u201D which she said is particularly true when it comes to newly emergent investment strategies like those seen in the digital asset market.","Blass considers the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund a \u201Cprime example\u201D of the SEC\u2019s recent engagement efforts and claimed that the agency \u201Cwelcome[s] and value[s] constructive industry engagement regarding new products and novel investment strategies.\u201D SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce echoed Blass\u2019s restrained optimism and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HesterPeirce\/status\/1202360725022400512?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> that the launch of the new fund shows \u201Ca bit of progress\u201D in this regard.","Â© 2023 The Block.
