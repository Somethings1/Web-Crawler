This means that the average consumer using these neobanks to purchase crypto loses out, as fintech firms are forced to charge extra transaction fees.","Neobanks have so far largely sought to build out crypto investment tools via custodial solutions provided by third-party crypto service providers. Revolut has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/147768\/revoluts-planned-native-token-will-reward-customer-loyalty-storonosky-says\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">endeavored<\/a> to launch its own standalone DeFi wallet app, but the product is yet to materialize.&nbsp;","\"Cogni's wallet, which is integrated with a bank account, will connect directly to an exchange which allows us to provide institutional rates to regular customers,\" said Cogni's Ravishankar.&nbsp;","Unlike other fintech companies, Cogni's wallet is built alongside its preexisting banking services in the app. This means that users can view everyday transactions and bills \u2014 ticket purchases, grocery bills and paychecks \u2014 alongside on-chain transactions in one interface.&nbsp;","The startup is also looking to dive deeper into NFTs with an integration that will be rolled out after the wallet's launch today, said Ravishankar. There are plans in the pipeline to enable NFT-based profile pictures.&nbsp;","In April, Cogni <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/143524\/neobank-cogni-dives-into-web3-as-it-raises-23-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> a $23 million Series A led by Korean firm Hanwha Asset Management and CaplinFO. At the time, Ravishankar said the wallet will launch on Solana initially before expanding to other chains. Instead, the wallet will now launch from the outset as a multi-chain solution and look to expand into new layer-one networks such as Aptos in the coming months.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
