Moreover, it grants EVM frameworks on Solana access to the network\u2019s core features.","Traditionally, Solana development has been centered around using languages like Rust or C for scripting smart contracts. However, the team emphasized development was evolving toward greater accessibility via Solidity and EVM.","\"Solana Labs is thrilled to announce that today you can now build on Solana with Solidity using Solang, a new compiler that helps bridge the gap between EVM developers and the Solana ecosystem,\" it <a href=\"https:\/\/solana.com\/news\/solang-solana-solidity-evm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a>.","Â© 2023 The Block.
