The firm has also acquired Proof of Talent, a New York-based crypto recruitment firm founded by Rob Paone.&nbsp;","Pompliano, a media personality and investor with 1.6 million <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/APompliano\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter followers<\/a> and nearly 400,000 YouTube subscribers, co-founded Inflection Points in early 2021 with Colton Sakamoto, according to the announcement.

Pompliano said that could be an opportunity for his firm as large non-crypto businesses need specialists to help target crypto talent that could include those who were recently laid off.","\"We work with companies native to bitcoin and crypto, but also companies that may only have a single crypto effort as part of larger non-crypto company. Reed Smith \u2014 an 1,800 person law firm \u2014 is good example on the training side of this too,\" Pompliano told The Block.&nbsp;","As part of the deal, Fifth Down Capital's founder and managing partner Andrew Spellman has joined Inflection Points' board of directors.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nProof of Talent, the firm being acquired by Inflection Points, was founded by Paone in June 2019 and claims to have helped 100 individuals find jobs at more than 40 companies.
