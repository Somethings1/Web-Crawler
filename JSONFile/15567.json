The hedge fund also said Monday it\u2019s making Dubai its global headquarters.","Seemingly a million miles from the murk and uncertainty of U.S. regulation, a flourishing community of crypto businesses has taken root in Dubai, thanks to a comprehensive rulebook that addresses everything from issuance and exchange services to advertising.","\u201CI think what's interesting is that VARA has really created an ecosystem for crypto in Dubai,\u201D Nine Blocks co-founder Henri Arslanian said in an interview. \u201CMany of our hedge fund\u2019s counterparties are one minute walk away from my office. Everybody is in this one square kilometer, which makes it easy to meet up, have conversations and generally enables a good exchange of information.\u201D","Nine Blocks follows a market neutral trading strategy, profiting from arbitrage opportunities and market inefficiencies across the crypto space.","\u201CBeing market neutral, we don\u2019t take any directional risk, so whether bitcoin is going up or going to go down doesn't matter much to us,\u201D Arslanian said. \u201CWe generate alpha from the inefficiencies in crypto markets. So, we will arbitrage between perpetual swaps and the spot price of bitcoin and ETH, for example.\u201D","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Dubai\u2019s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"VARA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Blocks Capital Management","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Henri Arslanian","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Arslanian","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Vara","Dubai","Hedge Fund","Licensing"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
