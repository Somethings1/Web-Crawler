The Court ruled quickly, on June 10, 2018, in a mixed bag ruling that gave both parties something.","On the one hand, the Court rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 broad demand for documents that were created after the lawsuit was filed, with an exception for communication with regulators, include the SEC. The Court reasoned that \u201C[i]t is difficult to imagine documents created months after the Tezos ICO that are relevant to whether the Tezos tokens constituted \u2018securities\u2019 at the time of the July 2017 ICO.\u201D","On the other hand, the court said \u201Ccommunications regarding communications between Defendants and the SEC or other governmental or regulatory agency\u201D might be relevant. In particular, \u201C[i] If Defendants characterized the Tezos tokens in those communications in a manner that conflicts with the manner they characterize them in this litigation, Plaintiffs are entitled to obtain those documents.\u201D","It has been a matter of speculation by some as to whether or not the current defendants are subject to any sort of regulatory or governmental investigation. If they are, the Plaintiffs will be entitled to find out and to see relevant documents. If not, Defendants will simply respond that there aren\u2019t any (though one expects they would have already said so, as opposed to objecting to the request).","Will this influence the outcome of the case? It\u2019s hard to say for sure. If there IS an ongoing SEC investigation in progress, the Defendants would surely argue that the investigation and any resolution (if there is one) is wholly irrelevant to the outcome of this case. It\u2019s not an argument without merit. Also, an investigation itself is typically confidential so it is certainly possible that responsive documents would be produced subject to a protective order (a confidentiality agreement) and not made public. At the same time, the absence of an investigation doesn\u2019t prove much either, however much it might fuel speculation on social media.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
