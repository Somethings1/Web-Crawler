This amounted to over 83% of the votes cast in the process.","\u201CThis snapshot will culminate the Head Chef search process, and will be used to bind the Sushi protocol\u2019s decision on the next Head Chef,\u201D the Sushi core team <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.sushi.com\/t\/head-chef-finale\/11120\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> in the announcement.","Jared Grey\u2019s background is in business development and IT consulting. His crypto experience includes a stint as CEO of DeFi yield platform Eons Finance.","Today\u2019s vote could mark the end of the Sushi DAO leadership saga that has gone on for almost as long as the protocol has been in existence. It all began in September 2020, when the pseudonymous \u201CChef Nomi,\u201D Sushi\u2019s first Head Chef stepped down. This came after accusations that Nomi tried to \u201Crug pull\u201D SushiSwap users by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/77090\/sushiswap-founder-converts-portion-of-developer-fund-to-6m-in-eth\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">siphoning over $14 million from the project<\/a>. Chef Nomi later returned the funds as well as control of the SushiSwap project to a team of developers led by FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.","A new leadership team emerged but they soon ran into issues. Chef Maki, Nomi\u2019s successor, stepped down in September 2021. Then, Joseph Delong <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/126879\/sushiswaps-cto-resigns-amid-infighting\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">resigned as chief technology officer<\/a> in December 2021 amid rumors of mismanagement of finances and infighting among developers of the project.","In 2020, the project team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/159818\/sushiswap-team-nominate-a-new-potential-head-chef\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recommended Jonathan Howard<\/a> as the new Head Chef. However, Sushi DAO members <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/166078\/sushiswap-reduces-proposed-salary-for-its-head-chef-role-after-community-pushback\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">railed against Howard\u2019s proposed compensation package<\/a>. This package would have seen Howard earn $800,000 per year plus an additional $600,000 worth of vested SUSHI tokens. Howard withdrew his name from contention in August, leading to a new search that culminated in today's vote.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
