This may look like something, but it doesn't look like anything you've seen before.' So we can't import these other ideas where an investment contract means there's some implied contract.\"","Additionally, she touches on the Court's perspective regarding the SEC's prior actions towards Coinbase: \"The judge that [the Coinbase case] is in front of expressed a lot of skepticism about the case because she said to the SEC, 'Didn't you guys let this one go through and allow them to IPO?'\"","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode Chaparro and Rettig also discuss:<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
