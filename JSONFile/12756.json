The firm started raising the round in October and closed it in December, Analog co-founder Victor Young told The Block. The funding was realized via a simple agreement for future tokens, or SAFT, Young said, adding that the round brought Analog\u2019s fully diluted valuation to $120 million.","Young, a blockchain developer and investor, founded Analog in 2021 with Sanchal Ranjan, a former Y Combinator-backed entrepreneur and currently a \u201Cgenesis member\u201D of Orange DAO. Young said that Analog\u2019s core team is based in Bangkok and Zurich.","Analog is building cross-chain communication tools for interoperability across multiple blockchain networks. Its core products include Timechain, a Rust language-based blockchain network; a generic message-passing protocol; Analog Watch, a developer-facing product; and Timegraph SDK and API suite that will allow application builders to compose applications across multiple chains.","Analog can be compared with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263109\/jpmorgan-apollo-axelar-oasis-pro-provenance-blockchain-interoperability\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Axelar<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266698\/layerzero-says-its-targeting-token-launch-for-first-half-of-2024\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LayerZero<\/a>, but Young said Analog is more developer-focused.","\u201CWe are building all the necessary features for cross-chain development as a single toolkit as opposed to relying on third parties such as oracles to achieve the desired functionality,\u201D he said. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAnalog is built on Substrate, Young added, noting that it will allow the upgradability of Analog easier than its competitors if there are new proving mechanisms.","Analog\u2019s public \u201Cincentivized\u201D testnet is scheduled to be released at the end of the first quarter or early second quarter, Young said. The mainnet is planned to launch in the late second quarter, he added.","There are currently 30 people working for Analog, and Young is looking to hire more people across functions, including engineering and business development, with fresh capital in hand.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
