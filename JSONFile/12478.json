It\u2019s operated by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sommelier.finance\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sommelier<\/a>, an on-chain investment protocol that runs as its own application-specific blockchain on the Cosmos network.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On Thursday, Sommelier activated the first Cellar on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/123044\/a-deep-dive-into-aaves-defi-ecosystem-with-founder-stani-kulechov\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aave<\/a>, a popular lending protocol on Ethereum. With Cellar, users can deposit funds and the protocol will automatically allocate to different DeFi platforms.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Cellar is programmed to automatically rotate capital across stablecoin lending pools, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/158264\/usdc-issuer-circle-lays-out-its-hopes-for-coming-stablecoin-policy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">USDC<\/a> or DAI, whichever offers the maximum yields.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cellars have been programmed to leverage off-chain computation. So they can take in various data feeds to dynamically adjust investment strategies based on changing market conditions. They will also leverage machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence that continuously trains itself using a stream of data to improve prediction outcomes.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The team claims that this automation makes Sommelier an improvement over other protocols, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/93818\/yearn-finance-dai-pool-defi-exploit-attack\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yearn Finance<\/a>, that allow users to optimize yields on their crypto assets through lending and trading services.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CVault-style portfolio managers like you find on Yearn have static algorithms, and when you visit those platforms you can see that there are many strategies that have simply stopped working because they were unable to adapt to changing conditions,\u201D Sommelier co-founder Zaki Manian told The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In October 2021, Manian, who is a former lead developer for Cosmos and Tendermint, raised <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/121495\/sommelier-finance-defi-zaki-manian-series-a-funding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$23 million<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> for Sommelier in a Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Given Sommelier is originally based on Cosmos, it relies on a cross-chain bridge called Gravity to manage the Cellar on Ethereum (in this case Aave).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Aave Cellar is the first among future Cellars planned by the community. Besides Aave\u2019s stablecoin strategy, the team says there will be many Cellars on various DeFi protocols, both in the Ethereum ecosystem and on other blockchains.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As more Cellars launch on Sommelier, the protocol \u2014 with its broad array of strategies \u2014 is hoping to attract a lot of capital.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We are targeting 500m in TVL [total value locked] in the coming year and it is quite achievable given the product pipeline we have is superior to current offerings in the market around ETH deposits, stablecoin lending which have massive amounts of liquidity across many of the platforms,\u201D said Manian.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Sommelier community will govern Cellars using its independent blockchain on the Cosmos network.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Operating as an independent chain, Sommelier claims to be more decentralized than other on-chain investment funds in the crypto space that may have centralized operations.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Usually, on-chain investment funds rely on multi-signature contracts to execute the investment strategy. The private keys to multi-signature wallets can be controlled by a central group of developers, which may prove to be a single point of failure.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In contrast, on Sommelier, there are network validators who oversee the Cellar strategies. This eliminates the need to rely on manual actions taken by the team via a centrally-managed smart contract. In exchange for their contributions, validators are rewarded with SOMM tokens.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMany on-chain investment platforms that allow for off-chain computation rely on multi-sigs to execute the investment strategy. In contrast, the Sommelier validator set is what executes Cellar strategies with the security guarantees of Tendermint consensus. As a result, Sommelier is more decentralized than many other on-chain investment projects,\u201D Manian said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Anyone will be able to propose new Cellar strategies and become \u201CCellar strategy providers\u201D if the strategy is approved by Sommelier's governance. This is because it\u2019s designed to be non-custodial, and the capital supplied is not dependent on a centralized team.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There may be risks, however, originating from a flawed strategy or algorithm. In June, a Korean firm called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/156031\/uprise-lost-99-of-client-funds-while-shorting-luna-during-its-price-crash?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Uprise<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> lost 99% of its client funds due to an automated trading strategy that failed to work amid an extremely volatile market.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In response, the Sommelier team said the project plans to avoid such situations due to checks and balances built into its decentralized setup. In the event of misbehaving strategies, the team said, Sommelier validators will remove a strategy provider\u2019s access to the Cellar smart contract.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
