Hence such third parties ask to proceed with a chain swap.\"","Chain swap refers to the process of transferring tokens from one blockchain network to another. The process allows users to bridge assets across multiple chains.","After the publication of this story, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/binance\/status\/1668218926721818624?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance tweeted<\/a> that it will swap 750 million USDT on Tron for USDT on Ethereum directly with Tether later today \u201Cto ensure stablecoin liquidity across all chains for our users.\u201D In a separate tweet, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Tether_to\/status\/1668233122066907137?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tether confirmed<\/a> the upcoming chain swap with a third party without naming Binance, but Ardoino confirmed the party is Binance.","This is Tether's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227529\/tether-another-billion-usdt-stablecoin-ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">second billion-dollar USDT mint<\/a> in less than two months.
