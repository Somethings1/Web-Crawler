In a text to The Block, Jansen wrote that \"[w]e have clearly seen the risk-off impact on BTC and the rest of the market as all assets have been massively sold.\"","His comments came amid a significant fall in the price of digital assets, including bitcoin, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/58521\/bitcoin-plunges-to-near-6000-levels-hits-new-low-since-may-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fell below<\/a> $6,000 Thursday.

In total, over $1.6 billion has been traded on the exchange during the same period of time, he explained.","\"BTC perpetual is trading at a discount to spot and the basis has come off as well. March futures are in backwardation on most markets. This bearish trend is amplified by significant liquidations on all derivatives markets including Deribit,\" said Jansen.&nbsp;","Crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitmex.com\/app\/index\/.BVOL24H\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin volatility index<\/a>, which benchmarks the price movement of bitcoin, spiked from around 4 to above 18 at press time.","","","Total hourly liquidation volumes of BitMEX's famed bitcoin perpetual swaps at once hit a whopping $501 million, with its three-day average being $11 million.&nbsp;","","","The market turbulence also applied significant pressure on exchange infrastructure, according to market participants. High-frequency trader Mike van Rossum told The Block that almost all major exchanges, including FTX, Huobi, BitMEX, Deribit all have technical issues such as order book lags.&nbsp;","\"During this time, one of FTX\u2019s databases got overloaded.
