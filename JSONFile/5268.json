Its existing shareholders include QCP Capital, Akuna Capital and Dan Tapiero's 10T Holdings.","The fundraising comes three months after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/152665\/ftx-deribit-bitmex-liquidated-three-arrows-capital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Deribit took a \"small\" hit<\/a> from liquidating Three Arrows Capital's (3AC's) positions after the now-bankrupt crypto hedge fund failed to meet margin calls. Deribit raised new capital to restore its reserves to where they were before the 3AC incident, according to one of the sources.","3AC collapsed in June after suffering huge losses from the Terra ecosystem implosion and the ensuing crypto market turbulence. The fund's $200 million investment in Terra's native luna token sank to almost zero as the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin de-pegged from the dollar in mid-May. Deribit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/155380\/deribit-3ac-liquidation-application-bvi-court\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">initiated a liquidation application<\/a> against the fund in a British Virgin Islands court in June.","The unique circumstances of the latest fundraise \u2014 given the 3AC hit and the current weak market conditions \u2014 translated into a steep discount for existing backers, according to one of the sources. Deribit was valued at $2.1 billion in its last funding deal in August 2021, when it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2021\/08\/20\/tapieros-10t-holdings-akuna-capital-buy-100m-stake-in-bitcoin-options-exchange-deribit\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> $100 million, the source said.","The $400 million valuation \"is essentially irrelevant\" because the fundraising is from existing investors, Luuk Strijers, Deribit's chief commercial officer, told The Block. \"It could have been any value. It's more a clawback of dividends from existing shareholders. We paid a high divided before and decided it's more prudent to strengthen our balance sheet and retain assets instead of distributing them to shareholders.\"","Strijers said a company\u2019s true valuation isn\u2019t known until it conducts an external fundraise. He went on to say that Deribit kept its valuation low in this internal round \u201Cto avoid discussions\u201D with potential investors and that a company\u2019s valuation matters \u201Conly matters when you raise externally.\u201D","Founded in 2016, Deribit caters mainly to institutional investors and co-founders John Jansen, Marius Jansen and Sebastian Smyczýnski keep a low profile compared to FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance's Changpeng Zhao. Despite this, Deribit has claimed an 88% share of open interest in bitcoin options trading, according to data from The Block's Research team.&nbsp; Open interest is the value of outstanding derivative contracts that are yet to be settled.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/options\/share-of-open-interest-across-bitcoin-options\/embed\" title=\"Share of Open Interest Across Bitcoin Options\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Deribit's lower valuation highlights the pressure bearish crypto market conditions are putting on private company valuations.
