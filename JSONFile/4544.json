It added that a couple of other parties joined the initiative but declined to name those due to non-disclosure agreements.","Blockchain.com also pushed for 3AC's liquidation, according to a Bloomberg <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-06-30\/blockchain-com-cooperating-with-investigations-into-three-arrows\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a>. It is unclear whether Blockchain.com joined with Deribit or has taken legal action against 3AC separately. The Block has reached out to Blockchain.com for comment and will update this story should we hear back.","Advisory firm Teneo is the 3AC liquidator, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/154809\/three-arrows-capital-liquidation-teneo?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as The Block previously reported<\/a>.

But Deribit beat them by applying earlier, the person said. Otherwise, the liquidator nominated by 3AC might have been appointed. The Block has contacted 3AC for comment and will update this story if we hear back.&nbsp;","3AC co-founder Zhu and a person named Chen Kaili Kelly are listed as creditors in the court order from 3AC's own filing. Kelly is Davies' wife, according to three people familiar with the matter.&nbsp;","Deribit's initiative comes days after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/152665\/ftx-deribit-bitmex-liquidated-three-arrows-capital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block reported<\/a> that it was among exchanges that liquidated 3AC's positions. 3AC is also an investor in Deribit, with an indirect shareholding via a joint venture with other shareholders.","BitMEX was also among the exchanges that liquidated 3AC and is owed $6 million by the fund, The Block reported previously. But BitMEX hasn\u2019t joined the Deribit initiative, a company spokesperson told The Block.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updates to show Chen Kaili Kelly is Kyle Davies's wife.&nbsp;<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
