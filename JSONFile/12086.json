It also aims to reduce the risk of DeFi exploits, providing built-in insurance for all smart contracts.&nbsp;","The decision to migrate to Arbitrum was driven by a need to provide similar levels of security, reliability and regulatory compliance typical in traditional financial systems while reducing the costs and friction associated with traditional asset issuance.","\u201CArbitrum\u2019s ability to provide a credibly neutral, efficient and mature platform, with a strong understanding of decentralized finance, made it a perfect fit for the foundation of Kinto,\u201D the team said.","\u201CArbitrum is the indisputable leader in the rollup space regarding adoption, TVL and technology maturity,\u201D Kinto founder Ramon Recuero added. \u201CArbitrum is a community driven ecosystem with thousands of projects being built by crypto-natives and we are excited to add Kinto into that discussion.
