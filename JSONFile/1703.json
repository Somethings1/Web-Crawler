During his first few months as FTX US President, Harrison helped expand the U.S. team and cement professional relationships, such as with the crypto derivatives platform LedgerX.","\"Six months into my time at the company, pronounced cracks began to form in my own relationship with Sam. Around then I began advocating strongly for establishing separation and independence for the executive, legal, and developer teams of FTX US, and Sam disagreed.\"","Harrison added that Bankman-Fried seemed rarely engaged in the U.S. business and that would impart decisions impacting the U.S. without warning from the Bahamas.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\"I saw in that early conflict his total insecurity and intransigence when his decisions were questioned, his spitefulness, and the volatility of his temperament. I realized he wasn\u2019t who I remembered,\" he wrote.","After further workplace hostility for five months, Harrison decided to make one last attempt at change. In his 11th month at the company, he wrote a formal complaint detailing the company's biggest obstacles to success and that he would resign if they weren't addressed.&nbsp;","\"In response, I was threatened on Sam\u2019s behalf that I would be fired and that Sam would destroy my professional reputation. I was instructed to formally retract what I\u2019d written and to deliver an apology to Sam that had been drafted for me. That event solidified my decision to leave. I knew an abrupt departure would be harmful to the company and my FTX US reports, and I wanted to best position the company for future success after I left. So I gradually wound down, finished building and releasing the U.S. stock brokerage, and saw FTX U.S. employees through their mid-year reviews.\"","\"I never could have guessed that underlying these kinds of issues \u2014 which I\u2019d seen at other more mature firms in my career and believed not to be fatal to business success \u2014 was multi-billion-dollar fraud,\" Harrison added. \"It\u2019s clear from what has been made public that the scheme was held closely by Sam and his inner circle at FTX. com and Alameda, which I was not a part of, nor were other executives at FTX U.S.\"","Harrison <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172744\/ftx-us-president-harrison-is-stepping-down\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stepped down<\/a> as president of FTX U.S. on Sept. 27, 2022.
