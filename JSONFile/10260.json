In March, Worldcoin <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/220402\/worldcoin-outsourcing-deal-jabil-iris-scanning-orbs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">forged a partnership<\/a> with Florida-based global manufacturing giant Jabil in the hopes of resolving issues related to orb production.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In May, Worldcoin <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229742\/sam-altman-worldcoin-app-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> its self-custodial mobile app in over 80 countries after a beta testing phase in which the company accumulated 1.5 million users while logging 60,000 transactions on a typical day. \u201CIt\u2019s already the fastest growing wallet in the world.

At the time, more than two million people \u2014 mostly individuals from underdeveloped nations located in the Global South \u2014 were already in line to receive tokens. People who had been verified by a Worldcoin orb were set to initially receive 25 WLD tokens.<\/span>","At launch, WLD\u2019s price rose above $3 before it would fall to a low of just above $1 in September, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248504\/worldcoin-wld-usd\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to The Block's Price Page<\/a>.

About a week later, a German regulator <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/242287\/german-authorities-probe-worldcoin-project-over-privacy-reuters\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">followed suit<\/a> by saying it would examine whether Worldcoin users have \u201Csufficient and clear\u201D information about how the project uses their sensitive biometric data.
