''Behind these protocols typically sit firms and stakeholders who derive revenue from their operations. Moreover, it is often unclear who, in practice, controls the governance of the protocols.''","The Bank of England will hold a consultation next year on the regulatory framework around a digital asset payment system, including the use of services, such as wallets, Cunliffe said.","The central bank and the Financial Conduct Authority will have additional powers to oversee stablecoins and other crypto-related technologies, once the so-called Financial Services and Markets Bill passes through parliament and becomes law.&nbsp;","The UK Treasury will also do a consultation on how to extend investor protection, market integrity and other regulatory frameworks that cover the promotion and trading of financial products to activities and entities involving crypto assets, Cunliffe said.","At the moment, only anti-money laundering legislation applies to those activities, he added.","Â© 2023 The Block.
