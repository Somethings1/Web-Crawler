This week\u2019s guest post by Preston Byrne is \u201CPJB\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">[related id=1]Motto v. Karpeles, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39254 (N.D. Il., March 12, 2019). [SDP]<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/strong><\/em>","Litigation has a long tail, class actions in particular. This opinion deals with the Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange collapse in February 2014, and denies a motion to dismiss filed by the company\u2019s CEO on personal jurisdiction ground.","Mark Karpeles was Mt. Gox\u2019s President and CEO. Per the opinion (which relies on the complaint) As Mt. Gox\u2019s President and CEO, Karpeles \u201Ccontrolled all aspects of Mt. Gox\u2019s business from the ground up,\u201D including software design and operation, public and customer interactions, and accounting practices. However, Karpeles was not responsible for \u201CMt. Gox\u2019s day-to-day accounting\u201D and did not personally respond to Motto\u2019s and Greene\u2019s communications to Mt. Gox. Karpeles also never made any specific decision to operate in Illinois and was unaware of which or how many Mt. Gox accounts were associated with Illinois.\u201D (Note\u200A\u2014\u200Athe Court treats all of the allegations in the Complaint as true for purposes of this kind of motion. They haven\u2019t been fully litigated yet, so they are all still allegations and it remains possible that the Plaintiffs will be unable to convince a judge or jury that they are true).","Plaintiffs sued Karpeles for losses they suffered after the exchange \u201Cwent dark.\u201D They alleged that he misrepresented the security and stability of the exchange and plead state claims arising out of the exchange\u2019s collapse. It went to bankruptcy in Japan, and Karpeles was arrested by Japanese police and \u201C[d]ue to these criminal proceedings [is] currently prohibited from leaving the country.\u201D","In order to sue someone in a U.S. court, you have to have something called \u201Cpersonal jurisdiction\u201D over them. There are a couple of ways you can get this\u200A\u2014\u200Aactual physical presence is one of them. But if you reach into a state and enter into contracts there, commit torts, or break laws, you can also be subject to personal jurisdiction. This is something that law students study in the first year of law school in civil procedure class and that practicing lawyers who focus on litigation deal with on a fairly regular basis.","Here, Karpeles argued that there were three reasons why there wasn\u2019t personal jurisdiction against him in this case. First, he argued that he never visited Illinois. The Court said that this didn\u2019t matter and that his virtual presence there was sufficient, even if the company hadn\u2019t specifically targeted Illinois. Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201Ccontacts with the exchange were not random, isolated, or fortuitous, but rather the product of Mt. Gox\u2019s virtual presence in Illinois, as some 7,056, or about 1.5%, of the addresses associated with Mt. Gox accounts came from Illinois.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSecond Karpeles argued it wouldn\u2019t be fair to make him defend the lawsuit in Illinois because he can\u2019t leave Japan. The court said it was \u201Cunclear\u201D if any other U.S. state had a stronger interest in jurisdiction over these claims than Illinois and that forcing the plaintiffs to litigate their claims would place a significant burden on them. In addition, the Court reasoned that \u201Cthe burden faced by Karpeles-his confinement to Japan arises from his alleged Mt. Gox-related misconduct.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThird, Karpeles argued that under something called the \u201CFiduciary Shield Doctrine\u201D he shouldn\u2019t be subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois based solely on contacts with Illinois that arose over work for Mt. Gox. This doctrine doesn\u2019t apply, however, where the defendant has \u201Ca sufficient interest in the firm\u2019s actions to overcome the fiduciary shield.\u201D Here, the Court reasoned that Karpeles\u2019 ultimate ownership of 88% of Mt. Gox, deprives him of the fiduciary shield where, Plaintiffs allege that he propped up Mt. Gox\u2019s value through intentionally fraudulent representations that he made and directed.\u201D","Bottom line\u200A\u2014\u200Athis lawsuit stays in Illinois federal court and proceeds against Mark Karpeles personally. This is a putative class action though and these things take a long time to resolve, so we may be reading opinions in this case for several years to come. Also, if you run a business from outside of the United States and allegedly do harm to people inside the country, the fact that you can\u2019t come home to defend yourself isn\u2019t necessarily a defense.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
