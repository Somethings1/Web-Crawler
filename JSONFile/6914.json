Originally, USN had used an algorithmic backing.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This was similar to TerraUSD, the stablecoin known as UST that collapsed in May and brought down its sister token luna.

The situation was exacerbated by a so-called double mint, where users had used their collateral twice to mint the stablecoin. The double mint occurred due to a flaw in the original stablecoin algorithm, Decentral Bank noted to the Near Foundation.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Considering the risk inherent to algorithmic stablecoins, Decentral Bank <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/155108\/decentral-dao-pauses-use-of-near-tokens-for-minting-usn-stablecoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pivoted away<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> from USN to a new design, where the stablecoin was solely backed by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/100614\/tether-usdt-stablecoin-polkadot-kusama\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tether<\/span><\/a>,<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> the largest centralized stablecoin, rather than near coins.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
