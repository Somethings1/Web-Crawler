Both the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/170620\/treasury-recommends-double-down-on-crypto-enforcement-but-with-more-guidance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">enforcement actions<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy0986\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">top-level recommendations for new laws<\/a> to govern digital assets were part of an agenda released by the Biden administration last year.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The markets effort is running in parallel to another major effort to advance a bipartisan framework for stablecoins.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Details of the Republican-led crypto market effort remain under negotiation. The goal is to introduce it this spring or early summer, and that it and a stablecoins bill would reach bipartisan consensus in the closely divided chambers of Congress, as well as final sign off from President Joe Biden, and provide more rules specific to digital assets.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., and House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn \u2018GT\u2019 Thompson, R-Pa., are the senior House players in the market structure effort.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thompson authored legislation around spot crypto markets last Congress, and his committee has jurisdiction over commodities laws, since a number of commodities come from the agriculture industry. The Pennsylvania Republican told The Block his committee was starting \u201Cfrom scratch\u201D in this effort while \u201Cworking collaboratively\u201D with the Financial Services Committee, but that the two chairs are on the \u201Csame page.\u201D&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thompson and McHenry agreed to principles on what new legislation governing crypto markets should look like earlier this year, after the North Carolina Republican approached him to coordinate efforts given an unusual degree of overlapping jurisdictions between the two committees on the issue.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe\u2019re working from those principles to structure Ag and Financial Services pieces for a securities and commodities regime for a holistic market structure bill,\u201D McHenry told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That said, the Financial Services Committee holds the lion\u2019s share of jurisdiction on the topic, with the power to rewrite securities laws central to crypto market regulation.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">McHenry, in addition to being one of the most effective negotiators and vote counters in Congress, is also considered one of the most knowledgeable members of Congress on financial technology, as co-author of a landmark equity crowdfunding law passed over ten years ago. The law was one of the last to amend securities laws to accommodate new technology, a similar dynamic to conversations around legal tweaks for digital assets.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The legislation effort recently picked up momentum when the House Republicans began coordinating with the authors of a high-profile, wide-ranging crypto policy bill from last Congress: Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The two were expected to reintroduce a version of their wide-ranging crypto legislation from last Congress before an upcoming industry conference later this month, but have pushed their timetable to coordinate with the House effort, Lummis said in an interview.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe\u2019re going to try to work with them and see if we can find ways to dovetail our concepts,\u201D said Lummis. \u201CSo now it\u2019s going to look a little different, I suspect, but because we\u2019re trying to merge ideas, we\u2019re hoping that once we get the merged product, that it\u2019s going to be easier to move.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The coordination is mutually beneficial and can give more weight to legislation going forward. Though last Congress\u2019 Lummis-Gillibrand bill was well-received by industry, it fell short of picking up momentum in Washington, and McHenry and Thompson enjoy the privileges of chairmanship in a chamber where Republicans can pass legislation on a party-line vote. Meanwhile Lummis and Gillibrand give House drafters sponsors in the Senate, and Lummis sits on the Senate Banking Committee, the counterpart to the committee McHenry chairs.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAs we finalize those things we\u2019re going to try to team up with the folks who are most knowledgeable and interested in the Senate,\u201D said McHenry. \u201CAnd certainly Senator Gillibrand and Senator Lummis have been deeply engaged on this.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","Though having Senate allies to introduce the legislation on that side of the Capitol could help the effort, Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and the Treasury Department will also play major roles in any bills becoming law.","Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signed off on recommendations for new laws around stablecoins and crypto firms in October. The Treasury Department and McHenry's staff <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/176803\/senior-house-republican-biden-administration-holding-up-stablecoin-bill\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">did not always see eye-to-eye<\/a> during stablecoin talks last year, but he said on Wednesday that the Biden administration was working with him and his staff, at least on stablecoins legislation.&nbsp;","Brown, whose committee any legislation would go through, has yet to express much enthusiasm for legislating around digital assets. The Ohio Democrat told The Block following a hearing in February that he's not convinced crypto has \"a real role\" in the financial system and he is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/225152\/gensler-sec-crypto-stablecoin-congress\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">largely deferring to Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler<\/a>.&nbsp;","Gensler has made clear that he sees cryptocurrencies as securities that should be following securities laws.","\"We're talking to Gensler ongoing,\" Brown said when asked by The Block following a hearing before his committee in February what his thoughts on legislation were. \"I'm very interested in a legislative answer here, but we need them,\" meaning the SEC, \"to be aggressive here.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
