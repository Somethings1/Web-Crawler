The Financial Times first reported the story.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Financial statements for one of Binance\u2019s UK companies \u201Cdo not accurately report\u201D the nature of its business, the directors of Dimplx said, nor do they reflect its assets and liabilities, \"including potential tax liabilities\u201D and turnover.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dimplx, which was formed as part of a joint venture with Binance in 2019, made the allegation in its own filings this month, raising questions about the role that UK companies played in Binance\u2019s global operations in the period before its warning from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a UK financial regulatory body.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In June 2021, the FCA issued a consumer warning against Binance Markets Ltd, a UK subsidiary of the Binance group, which banned it from engaging in any regulated activities in the UK. Binance had failed to provide basic information about its operations, such as \u201Ctrading names and functions for all group entities globally,\u201D the agency said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dimplx\u2019s claims center on another UK entity, Binance Digital, which was incorporated in the UK in November 2019 as a \u201Cpayment processing facilitator\u201D according to its annual reports, and was \u201Cresponsible for transactions\u201D between crypto and all national currencies except the Turkish lira, according to archived copies of Binance\u2019s terms and conditions.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In Dimplx\u2019s annual report for the year to February 2021, company directors Simon Dingle and Joshin Raghubar allege that there were a spate of inaccuracies in Binance Digital\u2019s accounts for 2020.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance\u2019s filing suggests that <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">at the end <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance Digital had roughly <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">£100 million ($100 million) in \u201Ccash and\/or bank balances\u201D in 2020, and that the same sum was owed to \u201Ccreditors.\u201D The Dimplx directors said they believe the £100 million represented balances held \u201Con behalf of Binance Digital customers who had visited binance.com,\u201D who would be \u201Cliable to pay transaction fees.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The financial statements, however, recorded \u201Czero turnover or fees,\u201D on any transactions recorded by customers during the financial year, Dimplx said.
