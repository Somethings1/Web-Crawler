He argued that user COMP rewards do not add value and those who receive the rewards immediately sell them.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The developer made the case that though the COMP rewards were helpful in bootstrapping the protocol in its early phase \u2014 by rewarding early users \u2014 they have grown to be \"very problematic\" now.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSince most COMP being distributed by the current rewards program is instantly sold off, existing users and token holders are at a great disservice.

Besides supporting a protocol\u2019s liquidity, it is believed that token rewards help contribute to decentralization. By distributing a token far and wide rather, it lessens the chances that the ownership is concentrated in a few hands.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI want to be very clear: decentralization of the protocol has been, and should continue to be, the primary target of governance,\u201D Hayes <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.comp.xyz\/t\/comp-reward-adjustments-v2\/3074\/17?u=hayesgm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. He added the protocol should not hurry into passing it and that it should take more time to evaluate its consequences. According to Hayes, stopping the rewards could turn out to be a mistake and lead to a fall in overall health of the protocol.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
