Source: TradingView<\/span>","Entitled \"AIP 1.05: Return 700M $ARB to the DAO Treasury [REAL],\" the Arbitrum governance proposal asserted that the unauthorized and premature allocation of 700 million ARB tokens, valued at over $1 billion, constituted a significant overstepping of authority \u2014 and not indicative of truly decentralized governance.","The situation began in early April when the Arbitrum Foundation reversed course on a pivotal governance proposal, AIP-1. This controversial proposal aimed to transfer 750 million ARB tokens to the Foundation, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/224459\/arbitrum-proposal-backlash-response\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claiming<\/a> that these tokens would finance investment projects leveraging Arbitrum's technology.","The action had already occurred despite not receiving approval from token holders \u2014 the decentralized autonomous organization that is, in theory, responsible for governing Arbitrum.
