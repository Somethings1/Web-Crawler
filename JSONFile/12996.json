Arbitrum, Starknet, zkSync and Scroll all release native tokens in 2023, and there will be a recurring discussion about the value accrual of L2 tokens against ETH itself as rollups manage to suck up most of the smart contract activity away from the base layer. There will be fierce competition between Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, zkSync and Scroll. While there initially will be a lack of demand for these scaling protocols, they will play a huge role as the next wave of retail arrives in the future. Polygon gets a huge head start as it successfully switches its PoS chain to a fully functioning zkEVM chain.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While there is still a lot of VC capital on the sidelines yet to be allocated, due diligence will actually be taken seriously for the first time in years with a focus on product market fit. Valuations for seed rounds will go back to near $10M. A lot of projects, especially those building on alt L1s, will simply run out of money and close down operations. We will see a lot of projects switch from L1s to different L2s to improve their chances of getting activity or simply better prospects of prolonging runways. Devs and operatooors will no longer be automatically paid $300k+ and we continue to see talent exodus for crypto \"visitors.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Token economics will be fundamentally rebuilt for lots of projects. Paying out large amounts of tokens as incentives will no longer make sense when there is not a lot of new demand coming in. Axie, Stepn and others won't be able to rely on ponzinomics to deliver value anymore.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum won't flip Bitcoin yet and no other coin will flip Ethereum. Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin in 2023, though. Crypto prices will continue to behave like tech stocks and be fully correlated to the monetary policies of central banks, primarily the Fed. When we start to see hints of decreasing interest rates in the short term, crypto will surge the hardest. But that might not happen in 2023. Until it does, prices of majors will stay roughly the same with next to no volatility. Gambling itch will be scratched by some tokens or NFTs that go up multiples.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OpenSea will continue to lose its monopoly status and its abusive approach to enforcing royalties will fail. Because of its insanely strong position for both spot and futures trading, Binance will become the focus of regulations globally, just like Libra once was. Coinbase and other U.S.-based regulated exchanges will likely benefit. Genesis will file for Chapter 11 and Gemini will face pressure due to its Earn program. GBTC and ETHE will not be dissolved.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SBF will not see a day in prison in 2023 and will continue to plead not guilty. U.S. regulators will use the FTX collapse to change how the crypto industry is governed, similarly to how Lehman and Enron affected policy worldwide. New legislation similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will be drafted to avoid FTX-like situations happening in the future.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Steven Zheng<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Overall macro environment will continue to put downward pressure on high-risk assets like crypto. However, if I can get the generous benefit of imagining crypto as an uncorrelated asset class, I believe the market will see the bottom forming on a second NFT wave that would be multiples higher than the one that peaked in 2022. We will break the last ATH NFT trading volume of $5B in 2023. Volume will be primarily driven by gaming projects, with many tier-1 crypto games finally opening up public access to their games after raising funds and selling NFTs all throughout the 2021-2022 bull market. A crypto game coin will break into the top 20 market cap. The second wave of NFT PFP projects will be driven by the last cycle's third\/low-tier projects that are focused on entry-level luxury appeal instead of highbrow luxury (see Seiko vs. Rolex). The beneficiary of the mass appeal wave might be Polygon, which has spent the last bull market setting the base for a potential influx of new retail users and acquiring smart engineers for zk scaling tech. Polygon will be the third largest app layer (behind BNB Chain and Ethereum) by the end of 2023 in both economic activity and market cap terms. I think people underestimate the demand and ecosystem development that will spring forth from the dYdX Chain, which also might jumpstart the Cosmos ecosystem.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In terms of negative events, I think a layer-2 rollup will experience an exploit resulting from centralized sequencers. Funds might not be lost, but users will get a shocking reminder of the size of funds at risk in still centralized solutions. Another algo-stablecoin will fail.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">John Dantoni<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The macro-environment will fare poorly with high-risk assets like digital assets. We may not have reached a final bottom in the prices of cryptocurrencies. However, sideways action over the next year is more likely than a severe slide down. 2023 will be a crucial year for developers and building, as less attention will be on hype, narratives, and prices. Layer-2s will continue gaining traction, and some will launch native tokens, including Arbitrum and StarkNet.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">New narratives for the next cycle, including Web3 Social Networks, will begin to form. Investment and activity in this sub-sector will grow in interest, with Lens Protocol and Farcaster experiencing the most growth early on.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Venture funding in the blockchain sector will slow down dramatically in 2023, especially during the year's first half. During the first half, we will see months where &lt;$1 billion is invested, which will be the first time for the sector since February 2021. By the end of the year, roughly $13.5 billion will be invested in blockchain companies, equating to approximately a 58% decline YoY in private funding.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Projects from the categories of Crypto Financial Services, Infrastructure, and Trading\/Brokerage will be the least affected by the volatility in market conditions.

As a result, we will likely see an influx of firms that may need to conduct a down round and raise at a valuation lower than their previous.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another option for companies in poor financial standing will be to seek a purchaser in the M&amp;A market.

We will also see a reversal of the prominent trend in 2021, where every crypto-financial company was looking to build a complete prime brokerage offering. Instead, 2022 has shown the need for certain services to be segregated and the risks and fallout that can occur when provided by a single counterparty.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lars Hoffmann<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On the macro side, China's sudden reopening coupled with stimulus as well as a slowing pace of FED rate hikes elevates global macro risk appetite towards the summer months, with crypto benefiting greatly from it. The fall and winter months are more difficult, with focus shifting back onto Europe's unsolved energy crisis. However, the upcoming BTC halving in March 2024 keeps industry optimism at overall high levels.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fallout from FTX and Alameda continues to reverberate throughout the industry for much of H1. Many smaller projects that kept (parts of) their treasury on FTX will fade out and quietly shut down. The Bahamas are mostly done as a jurisdiction for crypto companies. In H2, the focus will shift back to the upcoming regulatory wave as western lawmakers seize on the FTX insolvency to push through much harsher reporting and deanonymizing requirements without really addressing many of the issues that led to the FTX insolvency in the first place - centralization. DeFi will be heavily and negatively impacted by this in western jurisdictions.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Privacy continues to be a strongly advocated topic by many industry participants, yet it is ultimately given up by most as push comes to shove. Alternative privacy solutions for crypto natives continue to be developed and actually thrive in their respective niches.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After mostly cautious and strong-handed regulation in 2017\/2018, Asia continues to open up much more toward crypto. South Korea and Japan are starting to get serious about crypto in terms of sensible regulation. The migration of industry natives towards crypto-friendly jurisdictions continues and takes note of these developments.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Eden Au<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arbitrum and StarkNet will launch their native tokens, and they will both be top-10 in TVL by EOY 2023. Polygon will increase its NFT market share as it onboards more traditional brands. The Cosmos ecosystem will have increasing organic usage due to multiple sidechain development (e.g., dYdX, Berachain), native stablecoin support (e.g., USDC, IST), and the launch of Celestia. At least one notable rollup will implement upgrades to decentralize its sequencing process.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The withdrawal of staked ether will be enabled in H1 2023, and subsequently, Coinbase's cbETH will double its market share in Ethereum liquid staking, and the asset will be widely accepted as collateral by major DeFi protocols. Structured products will gain momentum as crypto natives increasingly favor the \"real yield\" narrative, and it can help bootstrap liquidity for on-chain derivatives products. However, privacy-focused applications will fail to gain meaningful traction amid increasing regulatory pressure.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The adoption of Euro-based stablecoin will grow steadily as the European Union finalizes the legislation of MiCA. USDC will surpass USDT and become the largest stablecoin by market cap, but Tether will still be significant and will not collapse in 2023. While it is still too early for non-stablecoin tokenized real-world asset (RWA) protocols to blossom, more RWA protocols will attempt to lay the groundwork.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The gap between Bitcoin's and Ethereum's market caps will continue to shrink, but \"flippening\" will not occur in 2023. No spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved. The YoY return of COIN will be positive. A new set of crypto-friendly first-world jurisdictions will slowly emerge, including the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, as they will seek to enact more reasonable regulations to attract talent.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Andrew Cahill<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BTC will remain the largest asset by market cap by year-end, but ETH will outperform in terms of price. SOL will outperform relative to other alternative layer-1s, but will fail to regain its all-time high. Layer-2 scaling solutions will continue to see increased developer and user adoption, but their native tokens will underperform relative to BTC and ETH.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There will be fewer hacks of interoperability protocols\/bridges as development teams learn from 2022's exploits. Adoption of interoperability protocols will remain low due to subdued activity on layer-1 networks.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite DeFi operating smoothly throughout 2022's market mayhem, growth will remain subdued throughout 2023. DEXes will post the strongest fundamental growth metrics relative to other DeFi use cases. NFTs and Gaming will remain the top sectors in terms of venture funding received during the year. Stablecoins will have another strong year and surpass $250 billion in circulation. USDC will increase its market share as transparency becomes an increasingly important consideration.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Greg Lim<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the period of easy money over, the ability to raise both equity and debt financing across crypto and the broader market make the 2023 outlook quite grim. Firms will need to remain more conscious of spending and we will likely see continued layoffs and headcount reductions. To note will be the increased regulation following FTX's fraud. With rates continuing to increase to combat inflation, it is likely that investors will seek to lend to the U.S. government and continue with risk-off strategies. The wide spreads of the past cycle will likely decline as incumbent wall street veteran firms continue building out their digital asset teams and strategies. U.S. housing market will likely see mass corrections in mid-2023 resulting in further liquidations as investors back away from crypto as legacy physical asset prices decline.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">George Calle<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2023, firms exposed to the crypto industry will face continued pressure. More miners will declare bankruptcy or restructure as they face debt payments that become increasingly more expensive than the machines and\/or BTC treasuries used to secure the loans. Large energy providers will become acquirers of equipment given natural synergies (mining with excess supply) and balance sheets that are uncorrelated to recent crypto market downturn.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2023 will also yield lower volatility than 2021-2022, resulting in fewer opportunities for traders to make easy profits. This new market paradigm will reward those who scrupulously track forced sellers or find parts of the ecosystem that are still over-levered, with a potential silver lining of creating more demand in the crypto options market as traders look to position around events or generally hedge exposure. A significant portion of 2021-2022 vintage funds will close due to poor performance, causing liquidation cascades in H1 and H2 2023, albeit smaller than those experienced in 2022. Seemingly 'safe' strategies and holdings will be tested. For example, due to the amount of funds involved in liquid staking, certain liquid staking derivative discounts to ETH could drop to sub 90% due to either on-chain deleveraging (see Lido's own thread on circular staking) and as funds just generally require liquidity. Unlike (potentially permanently) closed-end products like GBTC, expect LSDs to be arbitraged back to 1:1 as Shanghai approaches at some point in 2023.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">We should also be prepared to see more innovation and drama in the stablecoin market, but developments will come from increasingly bifurcated areas. Specifically, DeFi developers will create censorship-resistant products that creatively integrate into protocols, while policy-minded actors will more fervently explore regulatory-compliant payment tools. Language around a stablecoin backed by Fed reserves or a stablecoin carrying deposit insurance will be discussed in congress but not even included in any bill that hits the floor. CBDC researchers will largely abandon 'direct CBDC' models trialed in 2017-2022 and propose more integrated solutions that grant commercial banks the ability to re-issue or 'wrap' tokenized central bank reserves or commercial bank liabilities as stablecoins with additional properties before distributing to retail clients. These stablecoins will likely carry much of the same governance as CBDCs, or at the very least, would be subject to similar oversight. Regulators will also become just more generally interested in stablecoins as it resembles a new digital version of the euro-dollar market amid growing concerns about competing currency systems (China) and global economic fragmentation. Tether's backing issues will become a major talking point on Capitol Hill, maybe even causing a short-term minor depeg like in 2018, but Tether will not collapse. However, a top 10 by market cap stablecoin (either already existing or new) will collapse in 2023.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite opportunities for a more regulated crypto-dollar market, regulatory pressure will be a largely negative tailwind. Rather than providing clarity or guidance, the current regime of 'regulation by enforcement only' will continue if not strengthened. As a result, bank custody projects will be largely shelved (along with any other bank initiatives). However, expect at least one large traditional market maker to announce the opening of a crypto desk as the market consolidates.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Simon Cousaert<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While in 2021, the battle between different L1s was strong, user traction has since declined strongly and most non-Ethereum smart contract chains will keep declining in terms of user adoption and TVL.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Scalability technology will increase in adoption and user interest, similar to we <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/scaling-solutions\/optimistic-rollups\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">are already seeing for optimistic rollups, Optimism and Arbitrum<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.

I expect to see experimentation with regard to rollup tech, not only on Ethereum but on modular blockchains too.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Ethereum community will start thinking about staking and re-staking mechanisms to increase security of decentralized services. Eigenlayer is currently at the forefront of these ideas. If all goes well, Ethereum's Shangai upgrade will happen in 2023, allowing users to withdraw staked ETH. The combination of liquid (staking) dynamics will force users to think about how staked assets can benefit the ecosystem.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Abraham Eid&nbsp;<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2023 will see a larger shift in focus from infrastructure-driven development to application-based. In turn, there are likely to be hurdles climbed from the existing user-experience challenges that have played a part in the plateau of user activity. EIPs that enable account abstraction such as 4337 should create a noticeably smoother experience for users from a wallet action standpoint, which will likely spur growth over time, and aid in one of the existing challenges facing dapps from a mainstream adoption standpoint.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An increased focus on use cases that truly take advantage of design spaces that couldn't quite exist previously due to expensive block space on L1s is likely to occur, as well as interoperability solutions across different l2s likely to improve in part due to oracles providing a messaging bus that has more risk mitigation features than the existing bridging approach. This has already seen some experimentation with projects like LayerZero, but further maturity in 2023 with this technical approach will allow for a truly robust interoperability solution.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There exists a high probability that regulators will look and potentially enact new legislation around certain existing practices in the cryptocurrency space, namely in the DeFi sub-sector. With precedent already set in 2022 through the arrest of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev, it is likely we see clearer guidance around the usage of mixers and the consequences of partaking in a mixing service. Although the US treasury placed sanctions on Tornado Cash as a software protocol and further addressed consequences for all addresses having ever interacted with it, there is likely to be a more sweeping bill to codify the rule set around mixers. Also likely to experience more investigation and scrutiny is the existing MEV space, which will likely cause more dapps to consider design features centered around mitigating MEV.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">From a more high-level perspective, although 2023 will likely see less focus on quantitative tightening through Central Bank rate hikes, the second-order effects of this contraction will continue to be felt throughout 2023. This will cause cryptocurrency valuations to likely stay within ranges below prior all-time highs and speculation as a whole is likely to remain muted in comparison to the time period prior to the second half of 2022. This will likely spur greater focus on longer-term design decisions for the space.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wendy Hirata<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With all the incidents in 2022, trust in CEX and CeFi lending services is at an all-time low. Many market participants are searching for risk management, operational transparency and market expertise, which were overlooked in bull markets. Until proper measures are put in place and trust is rebuilt, institutional investors will be hesitant to take on a more aggressive position \u2013 they will continue to look for defensive \/ low-risk capital management strategies. Crypto financial services will have to release more structured products with principal protection to satisfy these needs and maintain their current level of operations. More institutional investors will look into staking as a safer source of yield, especially with more developments and releases of enterprise-grade liquid staking protocols in 2023. The rapid growth of cbETH and rETH this year showed that there is room for growth within the liquid staking sector, and it would be possible to see a new enterprise-grade protocol, such as Liquid Collective, take some market share away from Lido.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kevin Peng<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2023, L1 networks will continue to adapt to the evolving demands of the market. Cross-chain technologies such as bridges and IBC will further mature as new app-chains gain increasing relevance and usage. Crypto-based applications will become more user-friendly than ever as teams vie for mainstream attention and organic demand.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the ongoing fallout from FTX and other institutions that collapsed in 2022, many projects will be slowly abandoned as the realities of a lack of funding and demand finally catches up with those that have not been able to achieve product-market fit. DeFi exchanges and lending protocols will have an interesting opportunity to capture additional market share with trust shaken in their centralized counterparts. NFTs will continue to serve as a vessel for crypto's integration with arts and culture, as will games that find compelling and creative use cases for NFTs and fungible crypto assets. Although it is unlikely that a game built on the blockchain or heavily utilizing crypto mechanisms will rise to the level of popularity as the leading video game titles, the crypto gaming industry will grow larger overall and produce a few high-quality titles with modest but active user bases.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meanwhile, scaling solutions in the form of rollups will begin to see adoption that threatens monolithic blockchains and their ecosystems. Ethereum will remain the de facto settlement layer for DeFi and NFTs, while L1 networks that are primarily focused on execution optimization will need to heavily incentivize usage in order to remain competitive. 2022 was a year of reckoning for the crypto industry, but 2023 will be a critical year where developers turn their focus back to fundamental scaling and UX improvements, paving the way for greater acceptance among traditional finance institutions and eventual revitalization of the industry in 2024.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Erina Azmi<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Four crypto predictions for 2023.

These platforms will host dApps that have an improved and simple UX that is friendly to new users. A recent example of this is the rise of the popular trading platform on Arbitrum, GMX.

This further bolsters the narrative that Bitcoin is backed by energy itself, giving it more perceived value.

It will take years to restore public trust in cryptocurrency in the wake of FTX's fraudulent behavior, and many institutions will continue to distance themselves from digital assets until the public forgets and macroeconomic conditions improve and make risk-on assets more palatable. Despite this, distributed ledger technology's value proposition of providing more efficient value transfer and trustless financial rails remains.

Ethereum flips Bitcoin in market cap, albeit for a short period of time.
