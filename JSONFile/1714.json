Having the key-shares split across three different locations mitigates the risk of the keys being compromised and reduces the vulnerability of the system,\" the company said. \"Funds held in the wallet are exclusively owned and accessible only by the user.\"","Although the prices of cryptocurrencies have rallied lately, led by Bitcoin, Binance's market share <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/259575\/binances-marketshare-continues-to-decline-amid-rally\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has experienced<\/a> a gradual decline, falling from 74% in December 2022 to 50% last month."],"hashtag":[]}
