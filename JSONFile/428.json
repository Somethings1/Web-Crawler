Indeed, if history is a guide, the cost could near or exceed $100 million.\u201D","The U.S. Trustee, however, argued that an examiner will increase transparency in the case. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November after a run on its utility token, and could owe $3.1 billion to its top 50 creditors.","\u201CAn examination is preferable to an internal investigation under the facts of these cases because the findings and conclusions of the examination will be public and transparent, which is especially important because of the wider implications that FTX\u2019s collapse may have for the crypto industry,\u201D the U.S. Trustee wrote in a December court filing.","Lawyers for the joint provision liquidators pushed back on that argument, pointing to investigations into FTX that are already underway. New FTX CEO John Ray III is reporting the firm's finances to court, along with the official committee of unsecured creditors and several government agencies including the Department of Justice.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
