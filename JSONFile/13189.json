The story will likely imply that Black employees were discriminated against during this process; this is false.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase went on to say that the story will also likely allege that several Black employees referenced in the report filed complaints with the company, but, \"in reality, only three of these people filed complaints during their time at Coinbase.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The exchange further said that those complaints were \"thoroughly investigated\" via internal and third-party examiners and found \"no evidence of wrongdoing.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Overall, Coinbase warned that the story will recount episodes that will be \"difficult for employees to read.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Recent issues&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase has been in the limelight for its inclusion and diversity efforts since September of this year when the exchange's CEO Brian Armstrong put out an apolitical blog post. He said at the time that Coinbase is \"laser focused\" on its mission to build an open financial system while focusing \"minimally\" on \"broader societal issues\" and political causes.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Soon after the controversial blog post, Coinbase offered an exit package to employees that were uncomfortable with its stated mission. Nearly 5% of the exchange's 1,200 employees accepted a severance package at the time.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">These developments at the time also revealed that Coinbase experienced an employee walk-out over a meeting in which a question about Black Lives Matter was raised.
