{"summary":"New questions emerge for the whole crypto lending industry, which is likely to face new reporting requirements.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/117140\/secs-handling-of-coinbase-lend-signals-sea-change-for-us-crypto-lending","publishDate":"2021-09-09T13:17:10","id":10290,"type":null,"title":"SEC&#x27;s handling of Coinbase Lend signals sea change for US crypto lending","category":["REGULATION"],"content":["Crypto lenders may be facing the same fate as ICO issuers.","Brian Armstrong, the CEO of leading crypto exchange Coinbase, took to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/116888\/coinbase-sec-crypto-yield-product\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a> on Tuesday night to criticize the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s handling of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/110032\/coinbase-rolls-out-high-yield-usdc-product-taking-aim-at-fintech-offerings\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase\u2019s proposed <\/a>Lend product.","Coinbase Lend is, in principle, a high-interest savings account for USDC, the USD-pegged stablecoin administered by the Centre consortium, backed by Coinbase as well as crypto startup Circle.","Similar products already exist on the market. Gemini Lend is another that already exists at a competing U.S. exchange. Crypto neobank BlockFi has seen a range of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/113124\/kentucky-regulator-blockfi-interest-security\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">state securities regulators<\/a> train their sights on its interest account offering. However, federal authorities in the U.S. have not yet entered the public field to this extent.","According to Armstrong, Coinbase sought to get the SEC\u2019s approval before launching in a few weeks. \u201CThey responded by telling us this lend feature is a security. Ok - seems strange, how can lending be a security?\u201D said Armstrong.","A subsequent <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blog post<\/a> from Paul Grewal, the firm\u2019s chief legal officer, provided more legal details.The SEC had sent the firm a notice that it intends to sue them if they launch their new yield product.","As Grewal wrote:","\u201CCoinbase\u2019s Lend program doesn\u2019t qualify as a security \u2014 or to use more specific legal terms, it\u2019s not an investment contract or a note. Customers won\u2019t be \u2018investing\u2019 in the program, but rather lending the USDC they hold on Coinbase\u2019s platform in connection with their existing relationship.\u201C","He continued to criticize the SEC for responding to their requests by directing the firm to <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SEC v. Howey <\/i>and <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young<\/i>. Those Supreme Court decisions respectively fleshed out the terms \u201Cinvestment contract\u201D and \u201Cnote,\u201D which the opening of the 1933 Securities Act defined as securities.","The Howey test became famous among the crypto community as the SEC\u2019s justification for intervening in the initial coin offering boom.","The Reves test is both newer, and newer in crypto, and spells potential trouble for lending products. Outside of a narrow list of exceptions, it classifies all notes as securities, with the burden of proof of exemption on the party offering the note","Coinbase seems to be looking for crypto-specific guidance, operating on the belief that the new technology justifies new guidance. The SEC, meanwhile, maintains resolute technological neutrality \u2014 its guiding documents date to 1933 and 1934.","Some are seeing Coinbase\u2019s feud with the SEC as naive. Philip Moustakis, an attorney with Seward &amp; Kissel and formerly of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division, told The Block:","\u201CThere\u2019s plenty of case law on what kinds of notes constitute securities and what kind do not. That analysis does not change simply because a new technology is utilized in the issuance of a note. In existing law, notes are presumed to be securities.\u201D","Similarly, Anderson Kill attorney Preston Byrne <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/prestonjbyrne\/status\/1435452184607576066\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> that \u201C\u2018Yield\u2019 products are securities. They differ in no material respect from an unsecured bond. They just don\u2019t use the name.\u201D","Attorney and frequent crypto critic Frances Coppola noted: \u201COddly enough, because of its history, the US doesn't like high-yield deposits to be unregulated, especially when the marketing target is naive retail investors, the interest payments rely on extremely risky speculative investment, and the FDIC is not involved.\u201D","If the SEC has decided to treat crypto interest accounts and lending products as non-exempt notes or corporate bonds, those classifications would incur a whole different level of disclosure.","Cease and desist letters from state authorities to BlockFi already had the industry worried. The SEC, which has federal authority, bringing Coinbase, a publicly traded firm, to heel is a new expansion.","Indeed, Armstrong lamented that Coinbase had been unfairly singled out for being proactive with regulators. Moustakis disagreed with Armstrong\u2019s argument that uneven enforcement was a sort of injustice, telling The Block:","\u201CThe SEC does not have unlimited resources. It has to bring enforcement actions that have a programmatic impact. That is, enforcement actions that will grab the attention of the public in such a way that will change the behavior of the public going forward.\u201D","The move, however, was not totally unpredictable. SEC chair Gary Gensler has been clearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/113416\/gensler-speech-crypto-defi-lending-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">centering crypto lending<\/a> platforms in his speeches, alongside decentralized finance. The nature of DeFi makes it tougher to scrutinize \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/116633\/how-the-secs-reported-uniswap-labs-investigation-could-signal-a-new-era-of-enforcement\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">not that the SEC isn\u2019t trying<\/a>.","A representative for Gemini declined to comment on the significance of Coinbase\u2019s saga for Gemini Earn. The new developments could also prove significant for Celcius and Nexo, two international competitors to BlockFi.","On a longer horizon, the SEC\u2019s stated focus on DeFi could encompass lending protocols as well.","Alex Christian, founder and CEO of lending platform Data Mynt, told The Block: \u201CI've reached out to US regulators for years to no avail. Some regulators are keen on optics. The optics \u2014 absent legal action or guidance \u2014 lend arguably to market manipulation and scare tactics.\u201D","A representative for Coinbase declined to go on the record with The Block.","When reached for comment, Byrne said that \u201Cif the issues BlockFi and Coinbase are having with regulators are any indication, I think it is likely we're going to see more activity in this area with the passage of time.\u201D He further noted that Congress needs to step in to protect crypto lending in a fashion akin to bank lending.","Moustakis went even further, ominously referencing the SEC\u2019s pursuit of ICO issuers.","\u201CI think that what we\u2019re going to see unfold in the context of notes is what we saw unfold in the context of investment contracts,\u201D he remarked.","Â© 2023 The Block.
