The EIA also plans to solicit public comment on U.S. crypto miners\u2019 energy use.","\u201CWe intend to continue to analyze and write about the energy implications of cryptocurrency mining activities in the United States,\u201D EIA Administrator Joe DeCarolis said. \u201CWe will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.\u201D","The OMB\u2019s approval <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reginfo.gov\/public\/do\/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202401-1905-002\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">document<\/a> details an annual equivalent cost to the Federal Government of $193,152 for the survey.","The EIA <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reginfo.gov\/public\/do\/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202401-1905-002\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cited<\/a> bitcoin\u2019s price increase in recent months as evidence for the emergency request.&nbsp;","\u201C[The] EIA is making this [emergency] request \u2026 because public harm is reasonably likely if normal clearance procedures are followed,\u201D the EIA\u2019s justification reads. \u201CAs evidence, the price of bitcoin has increased roughly 50% in the last three months, and higher prices incentivize more crypto mining activity, which in turn increases electricity consumption.\u201D","\u201CAt the time of this writing, much of the central United States is in the grip of a major cold snap that has resulted in high electricity demand. The combined effects of increased crypto mining and stressed electricity systems create heightened uncertainty in electric power markets, which could result in demand peaks that affect system operations and consumer prices,\u201D it added. \u201CGiven the emerging and rapidly changing nature of this issue and because we cannot quantitatively assess the likelihood of public harm, EIA feels a sense of urgency to generate credible data that would provide insight into this unfolding issue.\u201D","Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at bitcoin miner Riot Platforms, <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/BitcoinPierre\/status\/1752842703610470623?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">disagreed<\/a> with the EIA\u2019s assessment, pointing to a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S266679242300015X?via%3Dihub\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a> on the impact of crypto mining on power grids. \u201CThe science is clear, experts agree that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/bitcoin?src=hashtag_click\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin<\/a> stabilizes the grid thanks to demand-response.
