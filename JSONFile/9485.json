Uledger, Inc. et al., 2:19-cv-07834, C.D. Cal., 9\/10\/2019 [SDP]<\/strong>","This is a new token sale lawsuit. It\u2019s not a class action. Instead, it\u2019s filed on an individual basis by Craig Clemens against Uledger and people involved in the sale and marketing of \"ULD\" tokens.","The Complaint says this sale raised $30 million between \u201Clate 2017\u201D and \u201Clate 2018.\u201D The lawsuit has 9 counts \u2014 1 is for allegedly violating the Securities Act of 1933 by failing to register with the SEC and the others are state law claims, breach of contract and a variety of common law tort claims, along with a corporate veil peircing theory (styled as \u201Calter ego liability\u201D) in count 8.","Per the Complaint, \u201CULEDGER is a start-up technology company that purports to have succeeded in \u2018leveraging blockchain\u2019s capability to create an immutable history of data\u2019 to give its customers \u2018a secure, private, tamper-proof, mathematically verifiable record of the content of their data at a point in time.\u2019\u2019 By doing so, ULEDGER claims to provide its clients\u2019 data \u2018greater integrity and makes it easily verifiable in the event of audit, legal challenge, or regulatory inquiry.\u2019\u201D (So basically, Uledger is a blockchain company that uses blockchain to create secure data?)","Anyway, they raised $30 million, allegedly, and Plaintiff says he bought $300,000 of tokens, but that the sale was based on \u201Cmany misrepresentations, factual omissions, and unlawful action\u201D, that he will never see a return on his investment and that the Defendants enriched themselves at the expense of investors.","Oh, about the defendants \u2014 it\u2019s not just Uledger, which plaintiff says was just a device to enrich individuals. So the complaint names the management team, including Taulant Ramabaja, Pete Anewalt and Josh McGiver. Also, it names Lorien Newman, who is described as a \u201CSecurity Token Advisor\u201D (remember those?) based in Israel.","One of the useful things about a corporation is that provides protection from individual liability \u2014 if it is set up correctly. In cases like this one, involving an alleged investment gone bad, it\u2019s pretty typical for a plaintiff to sue individuals involved in the scheme and to try to show that the corporation was just a sham. That is part of what is going on here and why there is an entire count of the complaint devoted to \u201Calter ego liability.\u201D","What does this mean and why does it matter? If the Complaint only succeeds on a claim against the corporation alone, if and to the extent the veil pierced the individual defendants will be held jointly and severally liable. It also means that (assuming the claim stands) plaintiff will be able to do discovery related to corporate structure or lack thereof, as the case may be, and (potentially) some aggressive asset tracing discovery from the individual defendants before actually getting a judgment.","We\u2019ve covered lots of token sale litigation in CCM and this one looks like many others that we\u2019ve seen, with the interesting twist that the \u201Csecurity token advisor\u201D was also added as a party. It also (again) shows how everything you say electronically can end up as an exhibit in a Complaint, including this excerpt where one of the defendants promises the sun, moon and stars:","","","Because this case is not a class action, btw, it can be expected to proceed a little bit more quickly. &nbsp;The next step will be answers or possibly motions to dismiss. &nbsp;I'd expect that the security token advisor in particular will be eager to argue that he's not subject to jurisdiction in the U.S. and not part of the group of people who can be subject to U.S. securities laws. &nbsp;We'll report back on developments of interest in this case as we see 'em.&nbsp;","<em class=\"mi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Crypto Caselaw Minute is provided for educational purposes only by Nelson Rosario and Stephen Palley.
