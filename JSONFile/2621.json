It lets users create \"niche, private, cooperative spaces,\"&nbsp;Murillo told The Block in an interview. She said the next brands and&nbsp;products will be created by cooperative spaces or squads and Koop enables anyone to contribute to decisions in communities.&nbsp;","\"Koop is built for collaborators, for builders, for self-starters, specifically those that are creating counter cultures,\" she said. \"And crypto has always been about niche counter-culture.\"","Koop says it currently has 50 active communities, with 8,500 on waitlists and $850 million in membership volume after two months in beta. To raise revenue, Koop charges membership fees of 2%, said Murillo.","Koop is currently built on the Ethereum blockchain and it plans expansion of Solana and Polygon in the near future, said Murillo. It leverages non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or collector passes to organize and manage a community and monetize in a web3 world.&nbsp;","\"We launched Aera Force with the premise of a community-driven participatory investment process. Anyone in the community that wants to contribute has the opportunity to and can earn rewards too,\" said Tyler Stambaugh of Aera Force DAO, a venture DAO focused on web3 climate projects. \"Koop is a core part of our stack, allowing us to scout, distribute rewards, and build a truly community owned network.\"","There are currently five people working for Koop and Murillo is looking to hire three more in engineering roles."],"hashtag":[]}
