This eerily mirrors the 2020 scenario, QCP argues, which culminated in the record volatility spike due to the Covid crash.","While the market remains speculative about another potential volatility squeeze, it's unlikely that the upcoming FOMC meeting will be the trigger, with another pause widely anticipated. The FOMC's appetite for further rate hikes this year also seems minimal, according to QCP.&nbsp;","However, \"At the same time, we do not see how Powell can assuredly call an end to this hiking cycle, given the surging pump prices and rebounding inflation,\" the crypto trading firm added, expecting higher for longer rates (no cuts) next year.&nbsp;","A potential U.S. government shutdown at the end of September, with funding for the federal government set to run out unless action is taken by Congress, and rising oil prices all fuel the tail risks, QCP said. It claimed that the Fed was unlikely to act on suppressing volatility this time.","\"In such a scenario without Fed easing, equities will likely be down, taking bitcoin down along with it until the Fed acts,\" the firm added.","Â© 2023 The Block.
