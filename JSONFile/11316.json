The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a super committee of regulators, has recommended additional legislation to grant a regulator more direct power over crypto markets, similar to the legislation that Bankman-Fried supports. In September, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam testified in support of the same bill backed by the FTX CEO.","Though regulators have for years taken enforcement actions against digital asset companies and projects, the majority of FTX and Binance\u2019s businesses exist outside the U.S. But the run on FTX\u2019s utility token and subsequent sale to Binance will be top of mind for policymakers in Washington.","\u201CIt becomes a Rorschach test, right? In which you could imagine the proponents of aggressive regulation of crypto could say, one, this proves that we need the SEC and CFTC to swoop in and to apply their rules right now, no new rules have to be written, let's just do this right now,\u201D said Ty Gellasch, president and CEO of the Healthy Markets Association and a former SEC lawyer.","Added Gellasch: \u201CYou could argue that this proves like hey, we need legislation to do this as soon as humanly possible, and try to pass legislation. Or you could see others argue, see, Sam Bankman-Fried doesn't know what he's talking about and we shouldn't do anything and the regulators shouldn't do anything lest they screw this up more.\u201D","Agnes Gambill West, a policy researcher at George Mason\u2019s Mercatus Center, compared the FTT token collapse to last spring\u2019s collapse of TerraLuna, an event that contributed to contagion within the crypto financial ecosystem \u2014 one that Bankman-Fried and FTX helped stem.","\u201CIt\u2019s obviously going to be attracting the interest of Congress and all these committees and agencies, so I\u2019m sure we have that to look forward to in the coming days,\u201D said Gambill West. \u201CIf JP Morgan did this to Morgan Stanley, and then turned around and bought Morgan Stanley, it would be ridiculous,\u201D she added, speaking to how Binance publicly dumped FTT over the weekend, sparking a run on the rival exchange. &nbsp;","A statement from Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., confirmed that lawmakers are watching as well.","Gambill West, who also co-founded an Ethereum-related startup and advises one of the regional Federal Reserves, added concern that Binance's the move could spark a new round of contagion in crypto markets, something that regulators would monitor.","\u201CThe fact that there aren\u2019t a ton of financial disclosures in the crypto world is a problem,\u201D she said, referring to the sudden demise of FTX. \u201CIt\u2019s definitely going to raise the radar for crypto regulation. The interesting thing though is, these companies are not in the U.S. So the question is, whose laws apply?\u201D","&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stephanie Murray and Kollen Post contributed to this report. <\/em>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: This story has been updated with new comment throughout.&nbsp;<\/em>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
