What I don't understand is why the industry seems to be saying that the only way that they can survive is if there's plenty of space for the drug traffickers and the human traffickers,\u201D Sen. Warren said in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nUX92uIRDVA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interview<\/a> with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. \u201COh, and the terrorists and the ransomware scammers and the consumer scammers and the rogue nations, North Korea that is financing about half of its nuclear missile program with crypto, that all of that has to be left open.\u201D&nbsp;","Sen. Warren sits on both the Senate Finance Committee and the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. She has been critical of crypto and has recently pushed her anti-money laundering bill, which would extend Bank Secrecy Act requirements, including know-your-customer rules, to crypto miners, validators and wallet providers.&nbsp;","The Massachusetts Senator reiterated her stance that it must follow the same rules as traditional finance. \u201CKeep in mind, in our financial system, pretty much everybody follows the same set of rules,\u201D she said. \u201CI'm talking banks and credit unions and credit card companies, gold traders and stockbrokers. Private equity now has to follow the rules. Precious metal dealers, Venmo, Western Union, but not crypto.\u201D","In Warren\u2019s view, the crypto industry represents the same kind of activity with the same kind of risk, arguing that it didn\u2019t need a specific form of regulation but that existing laws must be enforced. \u201CI just want a level playing field here if you're part of the financial system moving around literally billions of dollars. Remember, my bill is not a regulatory bill. It's a bill about law enforcement,\u201D she said.","\u201CI think that's the right thing, and I welcome anybody who wants to come in and make that happen. Frankly, I don't understand a defense that says no, we\u2019ve got to make sure that there is a place for those guys to play without getting caught,\u201D she added.","Warren\u2019s remarks were made in response to a question regarding pro-crypto attorney John Deaton \u2014 who aims to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278232\/crypto-lawyer-john-deaton-runs-for-u-s-senate-against-elizabeth-warren\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">challenge<\/a> for her Massachusetts seat in the fall \u2014 suggesting \u201Ctens of millions of dollars in crypto backpacks that could be weaponized against\u201D her this election cycle.","Known for his advocacy of the crypto space, Deaton has frequently criticized Warren and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler's approach to cryptocurrency regulation.
