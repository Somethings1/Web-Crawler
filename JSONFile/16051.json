That\u2019s the lowest figure in at least 18 months, which is when crypto derivatives research firm Skew began tracking BitMEX\u2019s data. ","","","A perpetual contract resembles a futures contract as it offers high leverage and is a margin-based product. However, there is no expiry or settlement and thus it trades close to the underlying reference index price. The exchange uses the term \"open value\" for open interest in its perpetual contracts when measured in bitcoin terms.","","","Open interest in XBT\/USD on BitMEX has crashed by over 50 percent from 115,000 BTC to 55,000 BTC over the past 12 days. \n","","","Activity has cooled significantly following bitcoin\u2019s sudden drop from around $7,300 to $3,867 during a 16-hour period from 10: 00 UTC on March 12 to 02:00 UTC on March 13. ","","","\u201CMarkets in general \u2013 both traditional and cryptocurrency \u2013 have seen volumes hit as traders figure their way through the uncharted waters of recent weeks.

During that time, bitcoin\u2019s price volatility spiked with prices dropping to $3,867 for just five minutes before quickly recovering above $4,000.\n","","","As a result, some in the crypto community suggested possible price manipulation on BitMEX. Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of Alameda Research and BitMEX\u2019s rival exchange FTX, published multiple tweets, wondering out loud if there really were hardware issues, and saying the exchange\u2019s unwillingness to address the market situation promoted the price slide. \n","","","BitMEX dismissed Bankman-Fried\u2019s argument as a conspiracy theory. However, the controversy seems to have led to a slowdown in the activity, as represented by the drop in open interest. \n","","","While open interest has declined from $1.2 billion to $500 million on BitMEX since the big long squeeze, it has skyrocketed for their rivals. On FTX, open interest has increased from $68 million to $128 million in the past 12 days.
