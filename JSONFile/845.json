The FCA paper explores the proposed regulation around issuing and holding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/259797\/stablecoins-need-to-be-regulated-says-federal-reserves-barr\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stablecoins<\/a>. \u201CStablecoins have the potential to make payments faster and cheaper for all, and that\u2019s why we want to offer firms the ability to utilize this innovation safely and securely,\" FCA Executive Director of Consumers and Competition Sheldon Mills said.","Mills added that the reason the UK's regulatory bodies are seeking feedback is so that proportionate rules can be created \"that benefit consumers and firms and also meet our objectives.\"","The UK's Prudential Regulatory Authority also issued a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/prudential-regulation\/letter\/2023\/innovations-in-the-use-of-deposits-emoney-and-regulated-stablecoins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/a> on Monday aimed at deposit-takers and the risks that arise from deploying multiple forms of digital money. The BoE body that handles prudential regulation statement comes in the form of a letter called \"Innovations in the use by deposit-takers of deposits, e-money and regulated stablecoins.\"&nbsp;","On Monday, the FCA, BoE, and PRA also published a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/paper\/2023\/cross-authority-roadmap-on-innovation-in-payments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cross-authority&nbsp;roadmap<\/a> that explains how the UK\u2019s current and proposed regulatory regimes for issuers of different forms of digital money or money-like instruments will interact.","Regulating stablecoins is the first phase of the UK's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/260020\/uk-treasury-releases-final-proposals-for-crypto-asset-regulation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">plans<\/a> to introduce a comprehensive crypto asset regulatory regime. The UK Treasury released its final proposals for regulating crypto assets on Oct. 30, in which the FCA was given powers to oversee the issuance and custody of fiat-backed stablecoins in the UK.","\u201CWe welcome the discussion papers jointly published today by the FCA and Bank of England exploring how the UK will regulate stablecoins in the future. CryptoUK will form a Working Group to provide a unified response from the industry and engage bilaterally with key stakeholders to provide the sector\u2019s perspective on these important issues,\u201D a CryptoUK spokesperson said.","The BoE and FCA are seeking feedback from the public and industry by Feb. 6 2024.","Â© 2023 The Block.
