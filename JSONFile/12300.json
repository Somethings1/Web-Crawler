The group currently outsources the banking services required for this business to various partner banks. In the future, a large part of this business will be handled by Sutor Bank.","The move will also allow Sutor Bank to expand its own crypto banking platform internationally. The platform currently supports crypto firms and companies that want to integrate crypto asset trading into their offerings with services for which a banking licence is required.","\"We are glad to have found an investor in BCB with whom we can continue our growth-oriented fintech and crypto strategy,\" said Robert Freitag, Sutor Bank's managing director.","Sutor Bank will continue to operate in its current form. BCB intends to continue all business areas despite its focus on the digital assets industry.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
