It then uses this information to create a biometric template of a user's face, which it uses to confirm a facial match.","Claiming Coinbase's KYC compliance procedure is \"unlawful,\" the complaint says that users would have no protection against identity theft if the centralized company's biometric data database was hacked. It also insists that the exchange should have permanently destroyed users' biometric data immediately following successful KYC checks.","Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","The complaint also claims Coinbase had to provide information as to the purpose of the collection, the length that it would be stored, how long it would be used and retained, and how it would be permanently destroyed. The filing argues that the exchange \"had no written policy, made available to the public, establishing a retention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric information.\"","The plaintiff \u2014 a Coinbase user named Michael Massel \u2014 seeks $5,000 in damages per intentional BIPA violation or $1,000 per unintentional violation.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/228072\/cathie-wood-ark-invest-coinbase-sec-lawsuit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The exchange's shares<\/a> are trading at just over $50 per share, having climbed nearly 50% this year.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase's share price is down more than 6.5% on the day.
