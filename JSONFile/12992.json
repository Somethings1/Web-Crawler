Malcolm went on to say that a slightly more dovish Fed would be an example of such a catalyst, however, the threat of tighter regulation should weigh on crypto going forward.&nbsp;","Malcolm went on to say there is a disconnect between crypto advocates and potential adopters that is \"seemingly impossible bridge.\" Notably, he said advocates need to \"amend their message and recognize setbacks and address remaining hurdles, rather than just keep reiterating how they think this is the next best innovation since the internet.\"","Finally, traditional asset managers have specific needs and constraints according to Malcolm, and longstanding legal and regulatory hurdles can\u2019t be brushed aside by increasingly tired hype.","\"Crypto service providers still refuse to meet them where they are, metaphorically speaking, and address their specific concerns.
