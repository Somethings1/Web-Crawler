Clayton said: \u201CI don\u2019t have a particular path. But it needs to be addressed,\u201D <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinDesk<\/em> reported.","Clayton clarified that he was speaking at the&nbsp;Consensus: Invest conference&nbsp;in a personal capacity and not as part of the SEC, but his comments may cast doubt on potential bitcoin ETF applications.","Themis Trading broker Joe Saluzzi shares Clayton\u2019s concerns. \u201CYou need to put in some oversight. The SEC can\u2019t give approval until they monitor the underlying [market] and feel comfortable that the price is not being manipulated,\u201D Saluzzi told <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block<\/em>. \u201CThey don\u2019t have the policy in place. When you try and cross into the traditional [finance] world, you\u2019ve got to play the traditional game.\u201D","Saluzzi did however concede that a crypto ETF \u201Cwill eventually happen,\u201D pointing to the Winklevoss twins\u2019 Gemini launch as a leading example. \u201CThese guys are smart, they understand about regulation.\u201D Meanwhile, the institutional incentive is there too, adding \u201CWall Street wants to make money.\u201D","Clayton was also asked whether Ripple\u2019s digital asset XRP was a security rather than a utility token. However his answer on the topic was vague, responding simply that \u201Csome of these questions require a lot of information.\u201D Clayton did not elaborate further.","Â© 2023 The Block.
