This reasoning also applied to Poloniex's spin-out, said Allaire.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe market share has been sucked away from the regulated US players and into these unregulated offshore players,\u201D he told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Allaire did not specify the unregulated crypto companies that have eaten away Circle\u2019s market share.
