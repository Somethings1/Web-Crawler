Wright is a fraud. That is not just my opinion, but that of Mr Justice Mellor of the U.K. High Court, who ruled today that the self-declared inventor of Bitcoin is not as he claims. Over the past five years, Wright, an Australian national, has wasted hundreds of hours of court time and millions of dollars suing a number of people who challenged his assertions.","This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","This Thursday, that ends. Following a two month-long trial brought by a consortium of cryptocurrency companies called the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) on behalf of the Bitcoin community, presiding Judge Mellor has stated in no uncertain terms that \u201Cthe evidence is overwhelming\u201D that Wright has been lying for years.","Wright\u2019s strategy was \u201Cdefinitely a perversion of the course of justice and fraud on the legal system,\u201D said Hodlonaut, a pseudonymous Bitcoiner with a serious reason to celebrate today\u2019s verdict. Hodlonaut, known for his cartoon cat avatar on Twitter, was sued by Wright five years ago for libel, after tweeting that the 53-year-old computer scientist was a fraud and a scammer.","See also: Stupid Things Craig Wright Said in His Latest Stupid Trial | Opinion","That\u2019s exactly what COPA was trying to prove by filing the first offensive case against the 53-year-old computer scientist seeking a \u201Cnegative declaration\u201D from the U.K. justice system that Wright is not Nakamoto. And they got it: Justice Mellor, in a highly unusual move, issued this verdict directly from the bench within seconds of the case ending.","It\u2019s conceivable that Mellor will now refer Wright for criminal proceedings under the Crown Prosecution Service given the enormous amounts of money and time the Satoshi Nakamoto pretender has cost the U.K. justice system. \u201CThis is not the only case Craig has going in the U.K.,\u201D Hodlonaut said, mentioning the suits against himself, podcaster Peter McCormack and a group of Bitcoin developers.","Including the other proceedings involving Wright\u2019s claims over the Bitcoin white paper, codebase, database rights and \u201CTulip Trust,\u201D said to hold 110,000 bitcoins (BTC), Hodlonaut estimated Wright has racked up upwards of 50 days of court time in the U.K. \u201CThey have to set an example on this because it's so, so extremely blatant,\u201D Hodlonaut said.","COPA, for its part, said it would refer Craig for criminal proceedings, which might involve the numerous times he perjured himself. Justice Mellor said he would issue a \u201Cfairly lengthy written judgment\u201D of the trial which saw Wright submit forged evidence and lie incessantly. Hodlonaut, who appeared in court during Wright\u2019s cross-examination, expects the document to be \u201Cbrutal.\u201D","\u201CIt hasn't always been easy, but I'm very happy that I stood my ground,\u201D Hodlonaut said, adding that he feels vindicated though not surprised by the verdict. \u201CInstead of breaking me they ended up handing me a chance to prove myself a better person. I\u2019m a stronger person now than I was five years ago.\u201D","In fact, Hodlonaut\u2019s defamation case in Norway contributed to COPA\u2019s winning argument \u2014 it was mentioned at least 41 times in COPA\u2019s closing argument and was used as evidence throughout the trial to show Wright\u2019s story has changed over the years. The case, which Hodlonaut won, is being appealed but, after today\u2019s verdict, may now be thrown out.","\u201CWe\u2019ll see,\u201D Hodlonaut said. He estimated he has spent on the order of $3 million in legal fees fighting off Wright\u2019s libel suits in the U.K. and his native Norway, some out of pocket but most funded by the Bitcoin community. \u201CIt\u2019s been going on for five years now \u2014 that's five years where I've spent basically a full-time job defending myself,\u201D he added. That\u2019s on top of his actual job at The Bitcoin Advisor custody and security firm.","In many regards, these cases should never have been allowed. The judge overseeing Hodlonaut\u2019s trial noted \u201CThe prevailing opinion \u2026 has been, and is, that Wright is unlikely to be Satoshi Nakamoto,\u201D and that Hodlonaut \u201Chad sufficient factual grounds\u201D to criticize Wright. While McCormack\u2019s judge said Wright had given \u201Cdeliberately false evidence\u201D \u2014 though still awarded him \u201Cnominal damages\u201D of Â£1.","Hodlonaut suggested Wright\u2019s legal campaign was an attempt to \u201Ca precedent in the legal system\u201D he could rely on, alongside patent filings, to show he was Satoshi because he didn\u2019t have any actual evidence. \u201CI mean, the only \u2018out\u2019 they gave me was for me to apologize and agree that he is definitely Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 the problem for them was that people didn't fold,\u201D he said.","Wright has his supporters \u2014 including investors in his fork of Bitcoin, known as Bitcoin SV (for \u201CSatoshi\u2019s Vision), and billionaire benefactor Calvin Ayre. But it\u2019s long been apparent to everyone else that Wright was lying since he burst on the scene with circumstantial or fraudulent evidence trying to pass himself off as Satoshi Nakamoto, the still unknown inventor of Bitcoin.","Despite promising to give \"extraordinary proof to an extraordinary claim,\u201D Wright has been unable to provide any evidence he authored the Bitcoin white paper or holds Satoshi\u2019s keys. Instead, over the years his lies have compounded, which allowed COPA to arm itself with countless examples of his \u201Cforgery on an industrial scale\u201D with which to ensnare him.","To list just a few examples that came up at trial: the original white paper was produced using OpenOffice while Wright\u2019s version submitted to evidence used LaTeX software; a pre-white paper document contained references to then-unpublished scholarly articles because, as Wright claims, \u201Cresearchers share\u201D pre-publication; another document showed hallmarks of being made with ChatGPT.","See also: Time to End Craig Wright's Harassment Campaign","\u201CIf I had forged that document, then it would be perfect,\u201D Wright said at one point on cross-examination, addressing concerns of another forgery. If anything, this single statement encapsulates exactly how deranged Wright\u2019s perspective is \u2014 not only is he a habitual liar, but he thinks himself god\u2019s gift to man.","It could almost be funny hearing someone perjure themselves in court just to pretend that they spend their lunch breaks writing patents and studying for two PhDs. But, given the untold damage he has caused, it\u2019s hard to have any sympathy for Wright.","Despite it all, Hodlonaut said he doesn\u2019t hate Wright, though he does find \u201Csome satisfaction in seeing karma\u201D coming full circle. \u201CWhat brought me through all of this was being able to focus on what's in my control, not what other people are scheming,\u201D he said. The support he got from the Bitcoin community also helped.","That said, if his appeals case is dismissed, in addition to spending more time with his family and working more as an advisor for his firm, Hodlonaut said there may be an \u201Copportunity to go on the offensive.\u201D","\u201CThere are some people connected to Craig\u2019s 'lawfare' based on lies that may have some consequences coming to them,\u201D Hodlonaut said."],"entity":[{"type":"Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Justice Mellor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tulip Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"McCormack","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Satoshi\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Calvin Ayre","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.K. High Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Craig","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Norway","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mellor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Craig Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"OpenOffice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Craig\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crown Prosecution Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Satoshi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Peter McCormack","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"five years ago","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hodlonaut","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Craig S.
