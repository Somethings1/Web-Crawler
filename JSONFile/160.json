The report said Bitmain will host a shareholder meeting on December 28 to seek approval from shareholders for a major change.&nbsp;","The latest twist comes three months after Wu took back the status, from Zhan, as a legal representative of Beijing Bitmain, the operating entity of the bitcoin miner maker.","In September 2020, Bitmain <a href=\"https:\/\/mp.weixin.qq.com\/s\/QjOSj-1mhr9teTyXlpjyZQ\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> Wu had regained the status as a legal representative while Zhan remained a general manager, hinting that the two sides had come to a short-term truce while pursuing efforts to work out a long-term sustainable solution.&nbsp;","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/806\/bitmain-files-for-ipo-on-the-hong-kong-stock-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain<\/a> said at the time that the year-long spat since October 2019 between Wu and Zhan caused serious damages to its bitcoin miner market share and its brand image while its customers and employees were caught in between.","The whole situation dated back to March 2019, when Wu and Zhan both stepped down as co-CEOs and co-chairmen after Bitmain's initial public offering application failed in Hong Kong. The two agreed to appoint a new CEO while Zhan became the sole chairman.&nbsp;","In an October 2019 coup, Wu suddenly ousted Zhan from the company and removed his roles as a legal representative, chairman and executive director, despite the fact that Zhan is a majority shareholder.&nbsp;","Wu said in an all-hands meeting with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/20301\/bitmain-and-kraken-motion-to-dismiss-alleged-bitcoin-cash-manipulation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain<\/a> employees in Beijing following the coup that he must return to \"save the ship\" and accused Zhan of ruining the company.
