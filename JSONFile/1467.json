Infura\u2019s first step will be to establish an open-source initiative to engage the wider DeFi community according to Infura co-founder Eleazar Galano, who today invited \u201Cearly partners\u201D to collaborate on the decentralized infrastructure.","Serving roughly 350,000 users and 430,000 developers, Infura\u2019s software connects decentralized applications, or dApps, to Ethereum without setting up a full node. Infura facilitates many widely used dApps such as MetaMask, ENS, as well as many layer 2 scaling solutions. Those that wish to forgo the operational costs associated with running a full node can turn to Infura, and in exchange, Infura harvests available IP and wallet address data from users that a full node otherwise shields.","Infura will develop its decentralized infrastructure while continuing parallel development on its centralized products that use ConsenSys, and Amazon-hosted cloud services to power Web3 platforms.","\u201CWhat we're focused on decentralizing is the lower level infrastructure layer beneath that so there's more interoperability between operators that serve this type of traffic,\u201D Galano told CoinDesk, adding that certain things in the customer experience can\u2019t be decentralized.","Â© 2023 The Block.
