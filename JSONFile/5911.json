As APAC CEO, Tiwana will lead Gemini's new product launches from the region and ensure financial stability.","\"Gemini has big plans for international growth this year in APAC,\" the Winklevi said. \"This initially involves building out product and engineering teams in India. We will also be expanding our business teams in both India and Singapore to execute GTM [go-to-market] strategies focused on growing our individual and institutional customer base in this region.\"","The news comes a month after reports that said Gemini is preparing to launch an overseas derivatives exchange to offer perpetual futures. The new derivatives platform will launch from APAC, a source familiar with the matter recently told The Block.","A number of U.S.-based crypto platforms are focusing on entering foreign markets as regulators in the country appear to have become hostile to the crypto industry. Earlier this week, Gemini rival <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227253\/coinbase-bermuda-offshore-derivatives-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase said it received a license to operate in Bermuda<\/a>.

The office will be Gemini's second largest engineering hub behind the U.S. and will add to its existing offices in the U.S., the U.K., Ireland and Singapore, the company said.","\"Gurgaon has many advantages including a very dense talent pool (which includes all of the national capital region \u2014 Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida), proximity to policymakers, and the presence of other web3\/crypto companies,\" Tiwana told The Block.","India has had a tough stance on crypto since it imposed stiff taxes last year. But the country hasn't declared crypto as legal, and thus, uncertainty remains. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/india-working-imf-fsb-crypto-123109016.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">India revealed that it is working with the International Monetary Fund<\/a> on a paper that will focus on \"aspects of the monetary policy and the policy approach to crypto assets.\"","Tiwana declined to comment on the regulatory situation in India but said the country is rich with tech talent and Gemini expects to hire \"hundreds of full-time employees\" there over time across functions including engineering, human resources and finance. Tiwana initially joined Gemini over a year ago from Amazon Web Services and has previously held product and engineering leadership roles at both Microsoft and Disney.","Whether Gemini's APAC growth plans will help it gain market share remains to be seen.
