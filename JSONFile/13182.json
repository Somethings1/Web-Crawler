This was a new derivative collection, consisting of a further 10,000 NFTs airdropped to BAYC holders\u2019 wallets. These are unique digital dogs \u201Cbred\u201D as companions to Apes.

Ten thousand of them would reward Bored Ape owners with new NFTs based on the traits of their original Bored Ape, created by exposing an existing Ape to \u201CMutant Serum\u201D of varying potency. The other 10,000 would be designed to welcome newcomers into the Bored Ape ecosystem with a lower cost of entry.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Next, the Bored Ape world got its own currency: ApeCoin, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/138156\/apecoin-tied-to-bored-ape-nft-ecosystem-debuts-with-planned-community-airdrop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched <\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in March in partnership with venture capital and blockchain gaming firm Animoca Brands, one of Yuga\u2019s investors.
