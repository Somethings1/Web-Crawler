However, it historically traded at a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/96611\/jpmorgan-anlysis-bitcoin-gbtc-premium-collapse\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">premium<\/a> until 2021\u2019s crypto credit crunch.","The narrowing trend \u2014 seeing the discount shrink from over 40% before <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235056\/blackrock-takes-giant-leap-toward-spot-bitcoin-etf-with-sec-filing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlackRock<\/a> and others filed spot bitcoin ETF applications in June \u2014 is likely a sign of increased optimism the SEC will approve a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., including the potential conversion of GBTC.&nbsp;","GBTC is up over 320% in a year compared to bitcoin\u2019s 160%, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/OTC-GBTC\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to TradingView.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/structured-products\/premium-of-gbtc\/embed\" title=\"Daily GBTC Premium\/Discount to NAV\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Binance had a disastrous 2023 on the legal and regulatory front.","In November, U.S. authorities, including the Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264010\/justice-department-set-to-announce-settlement-with-binance-bloomberg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">settled<\/a> with Binance, concluding a criminal investigation into allegations of money laundering and sanctions violations \u2014 marking one of the largest corporate settlements in U.S. history. The settlement involved $4.3 billion in penalties and included criminal charges against its former CEO Changpeng Zhao.

That amounted t0 $48.1 billion of the $153.1 billion total supply on Jan. 1, with the Tether-issued USDT at 50% ($75.7 billion) and the decentralized DAI stablecoin the third largest at 4% ($5.8 billion).","Fast forward to March, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/218993\/usdc-and-dai-remain-at-about-0-90-following-circles-disclosure-of-funds-at-svb\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">USDC significantly depegged<\/a> from the U.S. dollar \u2014 dropping to as low as $0.88 following Circle's announcement of holding $3.3 billion in reserves at the failed Silicon Valley Bank. The disclosure prompted a significant sell-off, with investors turning to other stablecoins, like Tether\u2019s USDT, or exiting the crypto market entirely \u2014 leading to a 15% drop in USDC's market cap in just 24 hours. The situation was further complicated by major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance halting USDC conversions amidst the turmoil.","Since then, USDC\u2019s market share has continued to be squeezed, falling to $26.2 billion (19%) of the now $138.8 billion total stablecoin supply as holders either reallocated to other crypto assets or exited into fiat last year.","USDT strengthened its domination both in terms of percentage and value, reaching 71% of the market with $98.6 billion of the supply. DAI has remained relatively flat, while new entrant First Digital USD (FDUSD) picked up $1.8 billion, or 1.3% of the market from a standing start.

That was until Ordinals exploded onto the scene last year, making it easier and cheaper to post fully on-chain NFTs on the blockchain.","The Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207086\/what-are-bitcoin-nfts-ordinals-and-how-do-they-work\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, offers a new way to store and trade digital content on Bitcoin. By utilizing satoshis, the smallest units of bitcoin, users can engrave NFTs, BRC-20 tokens and other arbitrary data directly onto the blockchain, with each piece becoming a unique, tradeable asset.","While the terms \"Ordinals\" and \"inscriptions\" are often used interchangeably, an ordinal is technically a unique serialized identifier for a single satoshi, and an inscription is the content or data attached to that specific satoshi.","Inscriptions have also been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266272\/brc-20-style-tokens-are-spreading-to-chains-beyond-bitcoin-but-why?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">spreading to other chains<\/a> in recent weeks, including Ethereum, Solana, Near, Polygon, Celo and Fantom, causing a spike in transactions amid an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266298\/bitcoin-dev-luke-dashjr-calls-inscriptions-spam-community-members-push-back\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ongoing debate<\/a> over the use of inscriptions.

The latest surge in demand for inscriptions saw this metric reach yearly highs in mid-December, with Bitcoin-based NFTs accounting for around 59% of the $518 million in peak weekly NFT trading volume.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/nft-overview\/nft-trade-volume-by-chain\/embed\" title=\"NFT Trade Volume by Chain\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","After the trials and tribulations of a tumultuous 2022 for the crypto market, it ended 2023 in a much better place.
