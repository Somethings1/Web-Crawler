People who want a safe, legal and easy way to make and receive payments, but aren\u2019t experts on monetary economics, need a simple tool and a clear grading system so they can decide which stablecoins to use,\u201D Jones said.&nbsp;","\u201CStablecoins offer a way to potentially reduce the risks of inflation and even hyperinflation, but users need better information about which coins are more reliable,\" he added.","Bluechip launches with ratings for 15 stablecoins and gold-pegged tokens initially: Binance USD (BUSD), Liquidity USD (LUSD), Pax Gold (PAXG), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP), USD Coin (USDC), XSGD, Dai (DAI), Rai Reflex Index (RAI), Frax (FRAX), Tether Gold (XAUT), Tether (USDT), Euro Tether (EURT), TrueUSD (TUSD) and USDD. The platform plans to expand its list of rated stablecoins over time.","Of the initial list, no stablecoin has achieved Bluechip\u2019s top rating of \u201CA+,\u201D according to a screenshot of the new platform shared with The Block ahead of the launch. BUSD, LUSD, PAXG and GUSD achieved the highest rating, each given an \u201CA\u201D grade. USDD came last, with Bluechip grading it an \u201CF.\u201D","The stablecoins are rated based on Bluechip\u2019s SMIDGE rating framework: Stability, Management, Implementation, Decentralization, Governance and Externals.","The stability of a stablecoin is evaluated based on how well it has and is likely to continue maintaining its peg. Management assesses the competence and trustworthiness of the stablecoin project's team. Decentralization examines the concentration of control. Governance looks at the measures in place to protect users from bad actors. Finally, Externals focuses on third-party indicators that might offer additional insights into stablecoin risks.","Bluechip also shared its framework with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin before the launch and incorporated his feedback into the methodology, Jones told The Block.","The launch of Bluechip is supported by MakerDAO co-founder Rune Christensen, Reserve\u2019s co-founder Nevin Freeman and StarkWare co-founder Eli Ben-Sasson. MakerDAO is the project behind the Dai stablecoin and Reserve is a permissionless platform for creating asset-backed currencies like the Electronic Dollar (eUSD) and ETHPLUS (ETH+). Jones declined to confirm the donation amounts but said the donation tiers will be disclosed on its website.","\u201CWe really need something like this. It\u2019s great that the Bluechip team has stepped up to make it happen, and I hope others will donate too and make this new approach to stablecoin evaluation possible as a non-profit,\" Christensen said in the statement.","\u201CEveryone says crypto needs to self-regulate, but nobody ever does anything because there\u2019s no big money to be made. Stablecoin ratings are an obvious necessity after the UST collapse, and it\u2019s great to see such a credible and well-meaning team taking on the challenge,\u201D Freeman added. \u201CThey have my full support, and I really hope they become as popular as CMC and CoinGecko, so that the next UST isn\u2019t able to swindle so many people.\u201D","Economists, such as Tyler Cowen, Robin Hanson, Alex Tabarrok and Lawrence H. White, along with Ameen Soleimani and Nic Carter, also serve as advisors to the project. The Bluechip team who designed the rating system consists of CEO Benjamin Levit, Chief Economist Garett Jones and Ratings Director Vaidya Pallasena.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
