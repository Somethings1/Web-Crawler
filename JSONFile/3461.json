There\u2019s a real blindness among many people in the US scene to what\u2019s going on in Asia, particularly in China. We\u2019ve decided to give away this advantage to everyone reading PoW, in the form of an additional column of updates on the Asian crypto scene: mining, exchange hacks, random shitcoins raising hundreds of millions of RMB, Chinese government regs and all. This is a bit experimental: if you like it, or if you don\u2019t please hit reply and let me know!","Some highlights this week: Sia hit a huge milestone with their 1.4 release, which gets them close to being able to work as a truly viable low-cost filesharing solution, Grin got a cool Chinese name (古灵币, literally \u201Cancient spirit coin\u201D), and Coinbase launched a staking service that supports Tezos to start.","Tiny housekeeping thing: projects that don\u2019t update in a given week won\u2019t be mentioned.
