She shot for clients like HBO and Vogue. She regularly appeared as a photographer on \u201CAsia\u2019s Next Top Model.\u201D Forbes named her as a \u201C30 Under 30.\u201D At the time she even said to herself, \u201CYou know, 2020 is gonna be amazing.\u201D","Enter COVID.","Suddenly the fashion shoots stalled, as you need to be in-person to shoot models. \u201CCOVID hit and basically stole my thunder,\u201D says Wong. But she had plenty of time on her hands, she was curious, and she started dabbling in new formats. If she couldn\u2019t shoot human models, she would create her own 3D models. Soon she became good at this. She kept practicing. Then she became a master. She started selling them as NFTs.","Shavonne Wong will appear on the AI Stage at Consensus 2024, May 29-31.","Now Wong is widely celebrated as one of the most creative, prolific, and influential Web3 artists in the space. The secret to her success? Wong truly believes in the underlying tech of blockchain, and how it can unlock possibilities for creatives. \u201CThe future is going to be digital,\u201D says Wong. This core belief makes it easier to survive the topsy-turvy crypto prices. \u201CAs the market goes up and down and does, there\u2019s this whole rollercoaster thing,\u201D she says. \u201CHaving an eye on that horizon makes things less crazy.\u201D","In the lead up to Consensus, Wong shares how she embraced NFTs, why the tools of Web3 made her truly feel like an artist, and how the advent of AI inspires her to \u201Ccreate work that starts conversations.\u201D","Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.","You made one hell of a pivot from fashion photography to 3D art. How\u2019d you pull that off?","Shavonne Wong: I basically spent the whole 2020 just watching tutorials online, learning how to use 3D software, and trying to figure out all the tools. At the end of 2020 I was at the stage of, \u201COkay, my models don't look like shit anymore.\" I started to create proof of concepts for my commercial clients. Putting my models in different scenario settings, lighting them, compositing them. And that's when I heard about NFTs.","What was your reaction at the time?","My husband told me about NFTs and I was like, \u201CDon't know what it is. Sounds very technical. But let\u2019s try stuff, right?\u201D So I basically got into NFT Twitter around January 2021 and started to check things out, ask questions, following people. And I was like, \u201CAll right, I'll make something.\u201D So I created a piece, minted it, and it sold. So I was like, \"Okay, cool.\" Created more pieces, they sold. I was like, \"Oh, shit.\"","What was the impact of that to you as an artist?","It was kind of cool because I felt, like, I'm finally in a space where I was actually creating stuff for myself, and finding people who want it at the other end. This was really the start of me taking on the role as an artist.","Because when I did photography, I never saw myself as an artist. I saw myself as a creative, a commercial creative, but I wasn't doing art for me. I was doing work for clients and listening to their voices. So the NFT space was the first time I really got the chance to do anything I wanted and put it out there.","The great thing is I got to do that. The bad thing is that now suddenly everything's a lot scarier because it's 100% my voice, and that meant that, when people didn't like it, it\u2019s hard to not take it personally. But it\u2019s been an incredible three years since then.","How else have the tools of Web3 impacted you?","Firstly, it lowered the barriers of entry. Suddenly it gave me access to a global audience for my work. As an artist, I definitely enjoyed the instant payments, the technology. I\u2019ve spoken to other creatives about this \u2014 where we come from commercial backgrounds \u2014 and the most stereotypical thing about most of us creative artists is that we suck at finances, and we are bad at accounting. We\u2019re just bad at numbers in general.","I can relate! I\u2019m still sitting on invoices from like two years ago.","That\u2019s the thing. Like, when I did photography, I\u2019d be really happy with the job I did, go home, and a month later the client would email me and be like, \u201CYou haven\u2019t sent an invoice.\u201D So now I\u2019m very happy that there\u2019s this whole smart-contract thing, and I just get the money. Like, ta-dah.","You\u2019ve now been in the space long enough to see a bull market and a bear market, and you\u2019ve seen the overall reputation of NFTs change. How have you navigated this?","For me, firstly, it\u2019s about believing in the technology. For NFTs and blockchain in general, this is a sound technology whether used in art or not. And I very much believe in a digital future, and I believe that art is usually representative of the times we live in. Because I believe that we\u2019re going into a digital future, digital art makes a lot of sense when it has blockchain providing the providence for it. So because I have that belief, as the market goes up and down and does this whole rollercoaster thing, having an eye on that horizon makes things less crazy.","You\u2019ll be joining us at Consensus at the AI Summit. As an artist, how are you thinking about AI?","I\u2019m very excited about our future because I feel like we\u2019re actually moving to a world where there are two different realities that are somehow the same reality, right? The digital reality that we live in, and then the physical reality that we live in. And I believe AI will be playing a huge part in this digital future.","Interesting. How so exactly?","We\u2019re talking about digital characters. We\u2019re talking about how AI will be part of our emails. AI will be part of how we\u2019re talking to each other. I don\u2019t even know what these incredible technology wizards are creating, but as they create and I learn along the way, I can learn and use tools that help support the ideas and artwork I want to create. And I believe that in the future, everybody\u2019s lives will be filled with AI \u2014 sometimes not even consciously, but it will be the underlying layer in so many things we\u2019re doing. I want to create work that talks about this future. I want to create work that starts conversations.","Can\u2019t wait to see what you create. Thanks Shavonne, see you at the AI Summit.","Edited by Benjamin Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"May 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Benjamin Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vogue","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"31","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shavonne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"HBO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shavonne Wong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"two years ago","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Consensus 2024"],"authors":["Jeff Wilser"]}
