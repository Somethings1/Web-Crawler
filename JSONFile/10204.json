Instead, most of the token supply was given to users who staked Floki.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Floki also explained that the volatility in user rewards occurs as they are subject to the market price of TOKEN, the utility token of Floki\u2019s sister project TokenFi. The price depends on market forces outside their control, the team said, adding that Floki\u2019s staking program rewards stakers with TOKEN instead of minting new supplies.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe do not believe there is any confusion amongst users as to how the staking program works,\u201D the team continued, saying that it has no control over the staked assets, staking contracts or the rewards.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Floki team did not provide further comments at The Block\u2019s request.<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
