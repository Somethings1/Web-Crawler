One bitcoin equals 100 million sats.&nbsp;","\"This improves capital efficiency and ensures that users are only taking counterparty risk with their funds when they have an open position,\" the company said.","The firm has built two versions of their product: The more simple-to-use Kollider Lite and the full-feature interface Kollider Pro. It has also introduced Kollider Synthetic Stablecoins and a browser-based Lightning Network wallet.","Kollider had previously raised $375,000 in a pre-seed round in 2020.","Â© 2023 The Block.
