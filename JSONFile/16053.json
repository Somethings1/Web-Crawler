Solana\u2019s SOL dropped 7% to trade at $185 after briefly touching $200 on Monday, while Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped more than 8%.

The Nasdaq100 also showed some downward bias, indicating a cautious attitude towards risky assets, although the S&P500 closed at another high,\u201D Kuptsikevich said. \u201CBitcoin has thus found strong resistance, and the $69.5K and $68.5K levels attract our increased attention.\u201D","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"BCH","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$71,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$85 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Alex Kuptsikevich","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$400 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$71K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$200","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$185","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Kuptsikevich","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cardano\u2019s ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 4","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitfinex","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"crypto exchange Bitfinex","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$69.5","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$68.5","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Trading","Markets"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
