Plus, keep an eye on the drama surrounding Flashbots and how it hopes to make amends.","It\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/devcon.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Devcon<\/a> time again. This annual Ethereum event will take place in Bogata, Colombia. The sixth Devcon is scheduled for Oct. 11-14 at the Agora Bogotá Convention Center.","Key speakers include Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi and Ethereum researcher Danny Ryan. Offchain Labs, Optimism and Matter Labs will all have representatives at the event as discussion around Layer 2 topics becomes more important following the successful implementation of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169299\/ethereum-activates-the-merge-as-it-shifts-to-proof-of-stake\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Merge<\/a>.","While the crypto industry\u2019s gravity pulled in a huge amount of talent from the traditional finance and tech sectors during 2021 and early this year, that trend has largely broken down. It\u2019s been replaced with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175764\/crypto-executive-exits-continue-as-firms-trudge-through-bear-market\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reckoning<\/a> of sorts, as many high-profile crypto executives have been stepping down over the last few months, starting with MicroStrategy CEO<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/161025\/michael-saylor-to-step-down-as-microstrategy-ceo-shift-to-executive-chairman-role\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Michael Saylor<\/a>, Genesis CEO<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/164014\/genesis-ceo-michael-moro-steps-down-from-role-effective-immediately\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Michael Moro<\/a> and Alameda Research Co-CEO<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/165564\/alameda-research-co-ceo-trabucco-resigns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Sam Trabucco<\/a>.","Still, this has reached fever pitch in the last few weeks with departures of Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, Voyager CFO Ashwin Prithipaul, Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky and NYDIG's CEO Robert Gutmann and President Yan Zhao.

It all started when it was made clear that the protocol \u2014 used to propose Ethereum blocks for the validators who run the network \u2014 was being used to create blocks that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174386\/flashbots-now-accounts-for-39-of-ethereum-blocks-as-censorship-concerns-rise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">censored<\/a> transactions from sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash. The problem was that Flashbots was dominating the block proposing space, resulting in a lot of censorship on the network.","The Ethereum community reacted strongly, recommending that if Flashbots couldn\u2019t solve the issue, it should shut down.
