The first was led by OpenAI CEO and Worldcoin founder Sam Altman, alongside former head of Stripe issuing Lachy Groom. Gradient Ventures, Google\u2019s AI fund, led the second round.","Meanwhile claims to be the first and only life insurer to offer products entirely denominated in crypto.","The fresh funding paves the way for it to be licensed and regulated as a life insurance firm by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. It will also be used for hiring as the startup gears up to launch its first product \u2014 bitcoin-denominated whole life insurance. &nbsp;","\u201CAs one of the few innovations in money in the last century, Bitcoin is on track to become a global store of value and functional currency,\u201D said Zac Townsend, co-founder and CEO of Meanwhile, in a written statement.","\u201CWhen you combine that with artificial intelligence, we see the potential to build a full-stack life insurance company with the aim to reach over a billion people globally.
