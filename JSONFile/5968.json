Bitcoin, on the other hand, is mainly being used as a \"highly volatile\" store of value and hedge against fiat devaluation.","While bitcoin and ether are both known for volatile price swings, the exchange rate between the world's two largest cryptocurrencies appears somewhat stable in comparison with a daily volatility rate of about 30% over the past year, according to the report. That's compared to 42% for bitcoin's price and 59% for ether.","\"On days in which BTC rises, ETH tends to rise even more,\" Norland wrote. \"When BTC falls, ETH tends to fall to a greater degree.\"","Still, the correlation between prices of the two cryptocurrencies has hovered at around 0.85 for the past year, suggesting a very close relationship.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: CME Group<\/span>","Ether also appears to be more sensitive to swings in the U.S. dollar, and the ETHBTC rate reacts more strongly to changes in bitcoin supply than it does to ether supply, according to the report.","\"A stronger USD appears to be more negative for ETH than it is for BTC,\" Norland said. \"ETHBTC shows near-zero correlation to movements in interest rate, gold and crude oil futures.\"","Furthermore, ether's supply tends to rise after price increases relative to bitcoin. \"In other words, ETH supply responded to price rather than drive it,\" Norland said.","\"If BTC rallies ahead of its upcoming April 2024 halving as it did ahead of previous <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239581\/jpmorgan-bitcoin-halving-stress-test-miners\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">halvings<\/a>, that might also help ETH prices to rise even further on a relative basis,\" he added.","Â© 2023 The Block.
