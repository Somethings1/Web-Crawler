Though the final text doesn\u2019t go that far, MiCA does require issuers to declare environmental impacts, using a method that still has to be nailed down.","The EU study, to be produced over the course of a year, will look at green issues like crypto\u2019s use of water, waste products and natural resources as well as energy, the commission said.","Crypto's energy use has also come in the crosshairs of the U.S. government. A 2022 report from the White House found that major cryptoassets are responsible for 0.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, though crypto proponents have also argued mining could help decarbonize energy grids.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nov. 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"MiCA","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"European Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$842,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"0.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"White House","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Energy","Proof-of-Work","EU","EU Commission","Environment"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
