However, she continued:&nbsp;","\"It is important that the foundations for sound regulation of the crypto financial system be established now before the crypto ecosystem becomes so large or interconnected that it might pose risks to the stability of the broader financial system.\"","Specifically, Brainard highlighted stablecoins and the increasing involvement of banks in crypto activities as areas of concern due to \"heightened risks of spillovers to the core financial system.\"","As to policy proposals, Brainard was relatively vague.
