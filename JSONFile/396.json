These can be traded for perks such as exclusive content or discounted merchandise.&nbsp;","\"Our clients are anyone who wants to improve the way they engage their users, customers, or fans,\" said CEO Linc Gasking in a written interview with The Block.","Gasking said that it originally launched in the music space and has so far worked with clients covering artists including Duran Duran, Annika Rose and Roxy Music. Clients in the charity, sports and retail sectors are set to launch campaigns using the Cub3 technology soon, he claimed.&nbsp;","Much of the funding will be funneled into launching its so-called Proof of Behavior protocol. Currently, in beta, the company says this system uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify and evaluate behaviors both real-world and on social media platforms. Behaviours and their subsequent rewards and then stored on-chain so that brands can access analytics to measure their return on investment.&nbsp;","\u201CFrom receiving a digital collectible for a retweet to incentivizing fans with unique rewards for streaming artists' new music, Cub3 is creating a Proof-of-Behaviour Protocol including a full-service web3 toolsuite where brands, publishers, agencies and artists can use positive reinforcement to create brand alignment and incentivize user actions,\" said Bitkraft founding partner Malte Barth in the release.&nbsp;","Cub3's funding round comes amid recent mixed fortunes for web3 loyalty programs. Brazil's Mercado Libre rolled out a loyalty token in August and coffee conglomerate Starbucks began beta testing its NFT loyalty program at the tail end of last year.
