Now-bankrupt FTX headquartered its exchange in the Bahamas, for example. But after Coinbase obtained a monetary license to operate there, could Bermuda become the new Bahamas?","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"<\/span>It'll definitely be a hotspot for businesses that do choose to relocate.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has targeted crypto companies including Coinbase, Kraken, Bittrex and Genesis with enforcement actions, settlements and investigations in recent months.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CEnforcement is heating up,\u201D said Andrew Gordon, the managing attorney of the Gordon Law Group. \"But regulatory clarity has not been or has not been increasing.\"","Bermuda has spent the last five years building and fine-tuning its digital asset framework since enacting the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bma.bm\/digital-assets-supervision-regulation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Digital Asset Business Act<\/span><\/a>, which established a licensing regime for issuing, selling or redeeming digital assets, operating as a payment service provider business using digital assets and operating as an electronic exchange, among other endeavors.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Since that time, Bermuda has granted licenses to crypto companies including Block and its subsidiary Cash App, along with Circle, the Boston-based issuer of the USDC stablecoin.","\u201CWhat Coinbase recognized, which is what a lot of other companies have recognized, is that we have a superior regulatory environment,\u201D Bermuda Premier E.

David Burt<\/span>","Burt himself is active in the crypto space, attending conferences like the Satoshi Roundtable in Dubai. The Bermuda premier recalled a recent visit with U.S. policymakers, including the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and members of Congress, to discuss Bermuda\u2019s regulatory regime.","\u201CIt's unfortunate what has happened in the United States,\u201D Burt said. \u201CNot everyone in Congress is clueless to what is going on. There are some really good voices that are trying to get this stuff done. But as you know, they're suffering from a little bit of an FTX hangover.\u201D","Burt was not available for an interview for this story.","Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., grabbed headlines last month when it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227253\/coinbase-bermuda-offshore-derivatives-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">obtained a license<\/span><\/a> from the Bermuda Monetary Authority.
