The first is Arbitrum One, which implements Optimistic Rollups to scale Ethereum apps. The Layer 2 network leverags Ethereum's security by aggregating transactions on the secondary layer and publishing security proofs back on the mainnet while maintaining a full record of the mainnet's state.","The second is Arbitrum Nova, which utilizes a protocol known as AnyTrust. Nova uses an off-chain data availability layer to store raw transaction data and scale apps. It provides developers with the ability to optimize for lower fees with cheaper storage, but has a slightly more flexible security model than One.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
