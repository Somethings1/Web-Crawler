It's a device that leverages information to extract useful work from ambient heat.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As first author Maxwell Murialdo explained to The Block, Szilard engines already exist in lab applications but \u201Cscale is minimal, so they\u2019re not practical for anything at the moment, they\u2019re just research devices.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Consequently, the paper is proposing a system that is impractical in the near term. However, it is a fairly revolutionary application of Szilard engines to crypto-systems, which would hypothetically link them with a fungible physical asset.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But while electricity may be stable given a stable economy, its prices vary wildly based on geography and access to fuel sources \u2014 a disparity that leads bitcoin miners to migrate in pursuit of the cheapest power. That disparity in electricity prices would in theory motivate early adopters of the proposed system.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CArbitrage will at least initially be the driver of adoption,\u201D said Muraldo. \u201CBut ultimately what we think will happen is this will help to drive electricity to a singular or at least close to singular price for the commodity.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is one of 17 national labs throughout the country.
