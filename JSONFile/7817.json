No valuation was disclosed.","The backdrop to the mammoth Series A raise, as pointed out in a press release, is the AI boom driven by ChaptGPT\u2019s success and the subsequent spike in demand it has driven for GPUs, the compute processors that enable such systems to absorb information.","Gensyn is a blockchain-based marketplace protocol that enables developers to build AI systems using connected hardware while paying on-demand. It uses a cryptographic verification system to give users confidence that the machine learning work sent via the protocol has been completed correctly.","\u201CArtificial Intelligence is laying a foundation for the next industrial revolution, and the realisation of its potential requires huge computational power,\u201D Ben Fielding, Gensyn\u2019s co-founder, said in a written statement.","\u201CWe believe the key to useful, aligned AI is allowing everyone in the world to contribute to its development. The best way to mitigate bias and misalignment is to allow more people to build models that reflect their views. In order to do that we need open infrastructure that connects models to the core resources, crucially computational hardware, that make them function.\u201D","Gensyn&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/21\/gensyn-applies-a-token-to-distributed-computing-for-ai-developers-raises-6-5m\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">closed a $6.5 million seed round<\/a> led by Eden Block in March 2022.
