However, after the judgement was unpacked, the verdict appeared more nuanced.","In the event of a verdict that favors the SEC, bitcoin could slip below $26,000, an analyst told The Block.","\"A ruling favoring the SEC might temporarily push the bitcoin price into the zone of $26,000 to $28,000,\" YouHodler chief of markets Ruslan Lienkha said, adding that \"a further drop to $20,000 is possible, but only in the case of impactful, negative events happening in TradFi, such as a simultaneous drop of stock indexes, gold, and some commodities.\"","Genesis' Gordon Grant argued that a fall to around $20,000 is unlikely, although he said his assessment excluded \"the simultaneous surfacing of systemic risks.\" He also underscored the narrowing GBTC\/BTC discount, which he said could be a sign of market optimism about the ultimate approval of spot bitcoin ETFs.","Whatever happens with the Grayscale ruling, CoinShares head of research James Butterfill compared the recent wave of spot bitcoin ETF filings to the first gold ETF applications, which were approved over two decades ago.","\"With gold ETFs, there were proposals around metal exchanges being supervised, we see similar solutions being proposed for the crypto markets today,\" he told The Block. \"This is a pragmatic approach and likely to win over the regulators in the end, it may just take a little longer than some expect.\"","(<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updates prices and report on China Evergrande.<\/em>)","Â© 2023 The Block.
