Bitpanda will retain a stake in the company.","\u201CIt is our philosophy at Bitpanda that you have to stay agile and focused to provide the best services in this fast environment. Since we first launched Bitpanda Pro, given its potential, we always knew and planned that its success would naturally make it evolve to become its own business,\u201D said Bitpanda CEO Eric Demuth in a statement.","Barraclough, who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/122230\/bitpanda-hires-jpmorgan-fintech-executive\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">joined Bitpanda<\/a> in October 2021 to run the Pro product, said One Trading will soon be launching \u201Cthe fastest and most scalable exchange\u201D in crypto.","\u201CWe aim to become a utility for large liquidity providers to exchange unlimited amounts of risk under a membership model instead of pay-per-trade and have low fees and deep books for retail with a number of liquidity protections,\u201D he added.","\u201CWe will then start listing more products with appropriate controls and vetting as we move into derivatives. Above all we want a regulated, institutional-grade platform where people feel safe to trade with unique product options.\u201D","Bitpanda raised hundreds of millions of dollars from venture backers in the crypto bull market and hit a valuation of $4.1 billion. Like many in the sector, however, it ran into trouble in the bear market. In June 2022, it emerged that the platform had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/154137\/investment-platform-bitpanda-lays-off-730-employees\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cut roughly a quarter of its staff<\/a>.","Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Vienna, Bitpanda was largely retail-focused until the launch of its Pro product in 2019.","One Trading said in this morning\u2019s announcement that it intends to operate as a MiFID Trading Venue. It also has a VASP licence. The pairing should allow it to offer \u201Ccapital efficient spot and derivative products\u201D for a wide range of customers. The MiFID licence will also allow the startup to list financial instruments, it added.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
