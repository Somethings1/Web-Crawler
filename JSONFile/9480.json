The funds were then funneled from the Arbitrum network to Ethereum and routed through Tornado Cash, a popular Ethereum mixing service used to obfuscate transaction trails, according to PeckShield.","Amid these movements, the Chibi Finance team\u2019s digital presence vanished overnight. Its social media accounts on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Chibi_Fi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a> and Telegram, as well as the project\u2019s website, chibi.finance, are no longer accessible. The Block was not able to contact the project for comment.&nbsp;","Meanwhile, the price of the project-issued chibi tokens, which hovered at around $1 yesterday, took a sharp nosedive, <a href=\"https:\/\/dexscreener.com\/arbitrum\/0xa13fbb5457155f96273899ea28b3a9ea8ed6a948\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">plummeting<\/a> to just $0.017, according to DEX Screener data.","This incident is the latest in a series of apparent exit scams that have resurfaced on Arbitrum and the broader Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem recently. Last month, the developers of an Arbitrum-based project known as Swaprum <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231539\/swaprum-dex-exit-scam-arbitrum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">disappeared<\/a> with nearly $3 million in a similar case. Earlier, in April, a decentralized exchange named <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/228485\/merlin-scam-certik-refund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Merlin<\/a>, operating on zkSync, exited after siphoning off user funds worth $2 million.","Â© 2023 The Block.
