The drainer then followed with another <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/peckshieldalert\/status\/1594296349704728576?s=46&amp;t=6sF3ddczcCBQpPOBVbxF7g\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">swap<\/a> of roughly the same amount for 344.53 renBTC.","The exploiter next began <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PeckShieldAlert\/status\/1594296725711499264\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bridging<\/a> the newly swapped renBTC out of Ethereum via Ren's BTC Gateway \u2014 effectively cashing out of the Ethereum blockchain in favor of native bitcoins.","As of 7 a.m. ET, about 45,000 ether had been sold. As of 7:20 a.m. ET, transactions were still taking place in real time.","The relentless selling from the FTX account drainer has put downward pressure on the price of ether, which has dropped almost 5% since the selling began. It has fallen through $1,200 and is currently trading at around $1,160.","Despite the heavy selling, the wallet <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x59abf3837fa962d6853b4cc0a19513aa031fd32b\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">labeled<\/a> \"FTX Accounts Drainer\" on Etherscan remains the 37th largest holder of ether \u2014 after being in the top 30 before the selling began. The drop follows <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CertiKAlert\/status\/1594289021030731778\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">transfers<\/a> of approximately 50,000 ETH to a wallet beginning with 0x866E, which is conducting ether-to-renBTC swaps.","The identity of the FTX drainer remains unknown. While many say a hacker was able to drain the funds from the embattled exchange \u2014 which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection \u2014 others speculate that the suspicious outflow of funds was an inside job.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
