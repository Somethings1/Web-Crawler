While opinions on this matter may vary, it will notably complicate the activities of fraudulent individuals.\u201D","The crypto derivatives exchange and copy trading platform\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitget.com\/blog\/articles\/bitget-to-introduce-mandatory-kyc-requirements#:~:text=VICTORIA%2C%20Seychelles%2C%20August%2022%2C,complete%20KYC%20verification%20upon%20registration.\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mandatory KYC requirements<\/a> came into force on Sept. 1 for new users and Oct. 1 for existing users to be able to deposit and trade.","\u201CCertain procedures have become essential to ensure continued global operations and to provide security and stability for our users,\u201D Chen said, adding that the move didn\u2019t lead to any significant issues for the firm, despite causing concern for some users.","\u201CFirstly, we are not the first exchange to introduce mandatory KYC,\u201D Chen said. \u201CSecondly, it's a prevailing market trend that was a matter of time and not an unexpected development. Overall, the implementation of these updated requirements has minimal impact on the majority of our users who are seeking a trustworthy and secure platform for their operations.\u201D","Bitget\u2019s move follows crypto exchange rivals <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236838\/crypto-exchange-kucoin-mandatory-kyc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KuCoin<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227943\/bybit-moves-to-impose-mandatory-kyc-rules-for-all-services\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bybit<\/a> in introducing mandatory KYC procedures for users earlier this year.","\u201CWe are confident that over time, users will appreciate KYC's role in building trust, as it helps crypto companies protect them against fraud and money laundering,\u201D Chen said. \u201CBy complying with AML and KYC regulations, we demonstrate a commitment to transparency that builds confidence with partners. It also aligns us with global regulatory standards.\u201D","The move also follows Bitget\u2019s plan to expand its global presence as part of a \u201Cgo beyond derivatives strategy.\u201D Bitget launched a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/225504\/bitget-venture-fund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$100 million Web3 Fund<\/a> in April and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221903\/bitget-bitkeep-acquisition-investment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">invested $30 million in the decentralized BitKeep multi-chain wallet<\/a> in March, subsequently rebranding it to the Bitget Wallet.

However, we have now transitioned to a model where full KYC is mandatory for access to all exchange services,\u201D Chen said.","Although KYC measures can help curb illicit activity like money laundering, it's not a silver bullet that can prevent all financial crimes, Chen argued.&nbsp;","\u201CDespite advancements made in [KYC and AML] processes over the past decade, their effectiveness often falls short,\u201D Chen said, with crypto exchanges needing more cost-effective, sustainable and scalable solutions for detecting and investigating financial crimes.","Future solutions should \u201Charness innovative technologies, including workflow enhancements, analytics, human control, Robotic Process Automation, AI and machine learning to bolster and expedite risk detection and remediation,\u201D Chen added. \u201CStaying closely attuned to changes in the regulatory framework is essential,\u201D as is strengthening \u201Ctechnical and human oversight over documents and transactions,\u201D she said.","AI, in particular, offers a dynamic response to modern challenges, enhancing regulatory compliance efforts, according to Chen.","\u201COne particularly promising solution lies in the application of AI, which holds the potential to bring about a substantial transformation in AML capabilities,\" the Bitget MD said.","\u201CAI has the capacity to deliver substantial operational efficiencies in critical areas such as customer due diligence, screening and transaction monitoring controls,\u201D she added. \u201CFor instance, traditional AML transaction monitoring systems often produce an excessive number of false positive alerts, leading to substantial operational burdens.\u201D","Given substantial leaks of personal information from crypto companies following the collection of KYC data in the past, such as crypto hardware wallet firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/88706\/a-detailed-look-at-the-ledger-data-leak-and-other-recent-incidents\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ledger\u2019s data leak in 2020<\/a>, Chen acknowledged the need to balance security and privacy.","\u201CThere are entire hacking groups dedicated to hunting for personal data, identifying vulnerabilities, carrying out hacks and selling this information on the darknet,\u201D Chen said. \u201CHowever, our user data is stored with the same level of security as cryptocurrencies.\u201D","\u201CProtecting user privacy is a core priority of our KYC process,\u201D Chen added. \u201CWe utilize strict protocols and advanced tools to guarantee users' personal data remains secure.
