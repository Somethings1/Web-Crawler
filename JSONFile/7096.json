DeSalvo raised more than $620,000 from more than 200 investors in his scheme, the attorney\u2019s office said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Later in May 2022, DeSalvo sold billions of his own Blazar tokens, causing the price to drop and leading to most investors to lose their entire investments, officials said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/files\/litigation\/complaints\/2023\/comp-pr2023-157.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">charged<\/span><\/a> DeSalvo on Wednesday and called Blazar a \u201Ccrypto asset security.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe allege that DeSalvo orchestrated several fraudulent investment schemes that targeted law enforcement personnel and promised astronomical returns, including one involving a crypto asset security that would somehow replace traditional state pension systems. Rather than producing any returns or revolutionary technology, he instead misappropriated and misused investor money,\u201D said Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s enforcement division.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DeSalvo preyed on retail investors, said David Hirsch, chief of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit in the SEC\u2019s enforcement division.<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CToo often in crypto, we see promoters perpetrate familiar frauds in shiny new wrappers by making claims that are difficult for investors to independently verify. Registering the offer and sale of securities enables critical oversight and improves disclosures to investors, and we will continue to pursue those who fail to abide by the securities laws\u2019 registration requirements,\u201D Hirsch said.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
