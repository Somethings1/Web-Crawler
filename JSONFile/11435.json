The market structure legislation would grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more direct power over markets for digital assets deemed by regulators to be commodities \u2014 bitcoin being the largest \u2014 while directing regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and CFTC to draft a road map of rules for how a digital asset could transition from being treated as a security investment, with substantial financial disclosures required, to a commodity, which would require less disclosure on behalf of the token or project.","Though the postponement could be the sign of continued last minute negotiations and changes, Rep. French Hill, R-Ark., one of the authors of the stablecoins bill, said during an online event with the Atlantic Council earlier Monday that he hopes both bills will advance out of committee before the end of July.","Â© 2023 The Block.
