FriendTech popularized the idea of having gated communities where users need to pay for so-called keys to access group chats, with the price of the keys getting more expensive each time one is bought.","Running on the Linea platform, Tomo offers a few different things compared to FriendTech, such as the ability to message someone directly. But the main aspect that makes Tomo different is that it lets users bet on the value of people's keys, if they were they to join the platform.
