However, given that difficulty adjustments attempt to maintain 10m block times, over long periods of time the average hashrate will be proportional to the average difficulty. So that means that, roughly speaking, difficulty futures should behave similarly to hashrate futures,\" said FTX.","The exchange <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.ftx.com\/blog\/forward\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">first unveiled<\/a> its plan to launch bitcoin hashrate futures in August, and the product has <a href=\"https:\/\/ftx.com\/trade\/BTC-HASH-2020Q3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">gone live<\/a> today after almost nine months of work.","FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told The Block that the exchange has seen \u201Ca ton of interest\u201D in hashrate futures, particularly from miners and related companies.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CWe've been growing out our relationships with mining firms and intermediaries.
