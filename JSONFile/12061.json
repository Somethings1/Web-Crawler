However, the moment you zoom out you are faced with a harsh reality \u2013 every major national currency has steadily (and in some cases rapidly)<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/fee.org\/articles\/central-banks-gold-and-the-decline-of-the-dollar\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">declined in value over time<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, and there are no exceptions to this unambiguous trend.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This trend long preceded the rampant money-printing triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, though the past year has indeed given rise to an unprecedented increase in the global money supply. Nearly 21% of all U.S. dollars in existence were minted in the past year, and while the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative easing does not involve the actual printing of new physical dollars, the result still comes down to<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/katusaresearch.com\/is-2021-the-death-of-fiat-currency\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">flooding the markets with cash<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to keep borrowing cheap. The total money in the U.S. shot up from $4.6 trillion in 2000 to $19.5 trillion in 2021, and it\u2019s no surprise that the USD has lost over a third of its relative purchasing power in the past two decades alone.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What does this mean for investors? For one, it\u2019s worth increasing your investment exposure to hard assets. The USD has lost 98.2% of its purchasing power relative to gold over the past century, and generally assets like real estate and previous metals have maintained their market value significantly better than every national currency. However, out of all your available investment options, cryptocurrencies have the most asymmetric advantages and the strongest track record.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cryptocurrencies are relatively new, and there is a big difference in quality and design between different crypto projects. Many of the same criticisms levied against cryptocurrencies apply to fiat currencies like the USD, EURO, and JPY, but the truth is the leading crypto projects are hard-coded to have a predictable, capped supply. This means that, unlike the USD and other national currencies, the supply of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies cannot be unilaterally expanded or changed by anyone. Nearly 90% of the total supply of Bitcoin has already been created, and there is no way to change this total supply cap now or in the future. And even though most blockchain projects are open source, you cannot secretly duplicate a cryptocurrency network since a cloned project will not have the transaction history as the original project its derived from. In other words: unlike fiat currencies, your cryptocurrencies cannot be diluted through supply inflation.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Also, portfolio diversification is especially crucial during periods of economic uncertainty. It\u2019s extremely risky to put all your eggs in one basket under current market conditions, whether that basket consists of stocks, commercial real estate, or crypto. The key is to allocate your holdings across multiple uncorrelated assets and rebalance your portfolio over time. The price of Bitcoin is only<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockchaincenter.net\/cryptocurrency-correlation-study\/?timeframe=180days&amp;asset1=XAU&amp;asset2=BTC\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">loosely correlated<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to the S&amp;P 500, with a 180-day correlation coefficient of 0.2, and the cryptocurrency\u2019s correlation with gold is -0.08. Many other cryptocurrencies move in tandem with Bitcoin\u2019s movements, and these loose correlations to traditional investments underscore crypto\u2019s potential as an effective portfolio diversifier.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the end of the day, we believe there is a responsible way to invest in crypto without taking on too much risk. The best way to do this is through a crypto lending platform like Vauld, which lets you earn<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vauld.com\/rates\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">12.68% APY<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> on your USD-backed stablecoins, which is more than the SPY\u2019s historical returns.
