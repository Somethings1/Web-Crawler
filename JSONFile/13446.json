To this end, the system acts as a self-governing insurance fund for DeFi of sorts.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KeeperDAO said, using its system, users can exploit more on-chain profit opportunities presented by protocols such as MakerDAO and Compound than they would be able to capture as individuals. Such opportunities, however, are mainly available in times of high volatility. So in periods of low volatility, KeeperDAO said it utilizes assets held by the liquidity pool to loan out on markets such as Compound and dYdX.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There are currently 208 unique depositors to KeeperDAO's liquidity pool, and the pool is currently sized at 4,474 ETH (worth about $1.5 million), according to a&nbsp;<\/span><a class=\"_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/explore.duneanalytics.com\/public\/dashboards\/RVyXbw2l5EuqnnDw5tDmbXdW3Pf9bgKgxtZdzXIh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dune Analytics<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;dashboard shared by Kullander.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"As DeFi continues its torrential growth, KeeperDAO and its cryptoeconomic incentives will help keep Ethereum onchain liquidations efficient and ensure that keepers can earn their keep,\" said Su Zhu, CEO and CIO of Three Arrows Capital.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KeeperDAO is also planning to issue its own governance token to use it as a balancing mechanism to manage incentives between keepers and liquidity providers.
