His evocative work is widely credited for inspiring the literary subculture movement known as the Beat Generation.","Beginning on Aug. 10, the Fahey\/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles will unveil a new exhibition titled \u201CMuses & Self: Photographs by Allen Ginsberg,\u201D featuring photographs from Ginsberg\u2019s collection. In addition, the gallery will host a preview of \u201CA Picture of My Mind: Poems Written by Allen Ginsberg\u2019s Photographs,\u201D a collection of poems generated by an AI trained using Ginsberg\u2019s literary body of work.","Read more: How Artists Can Create AI Data Sets","The exhibition runs through September and was developed in collaboration with non-fungible token (NFT) poetry gallery and digital community TheVERSEverse with support from the Tezos Foundation. The collection utilizes an AI-powered camera that turns visual imagery into text.","\u201CIn celebration of Ginsberg\u2019s avowedly experimental impulses, this collaboration utilizes an AI-powered camera to \u2018read\u2019 a selection of Ginsberg photographs on view during the exhibition, translating his iconic vision of American counterculture into poetic responses influenced simultaneously by Ginsberg\u2019s canon, his undeniable presence woven inextricably into the written record of the internet, and parsed by AI,\u201D the gallery writes in its description of the exhibition.","\u201CJust as Ginsberg innovated with automated writing techniques and popular technologies, this collection of AI-generated poems taps the contemporary linguistic avant-garde to engage ritualistically, intuitively and meaningfully with Ginsberg\u2019s visual and poetic vernacular,\u201D it adds.","The development of AI has accelerated in recent months following the mainstream proliferation of popular tools like Midjourney and ChatGPT. AI tools have been created to help artists across genres and disciplines, from music to art to text-based designs. AI tools have also been used to replicate the styles of particular artists, both living and post-mortem, though there have been allegations of misappropriation of these tools to steal artists\u2019 work without credit.","Edited by Nick Baker.","\n","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"Tezos Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Los Angeles","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"\u201CMuses & Self","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fahey\/Klein Gallery","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1997","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aug. 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1955","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Midjourney","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Allen Ginsberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ginsberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ginsberg","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["AI","Web3","DAO","theVERSEverse","Art"],"authors":["Rosie Perper"]}
