Thom Tillis, R-N.C., is drafting legislation to require digital asset exchanges and custodians operating in the U.S. to provide an independently verified proof-of-reserves for their assets.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In a brief interview with The Block, Tillis characterized his draft legislation as an easier bill to pass than a comprehensive framework around cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI\u2019m in the lean regulatory regime camp here,\u201D said Tillis, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The bill aims to head off another major crypto firm collapse, like FTX\u2019s following a run on the company\u2019s FTT exchange token. Companies would also be explicitly prohibited from commingling customer assets with company funds, as prosecutors allege happened with FTX and Alameda Research, the Bahamian exchange\u2019s sister investment firm.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Companies holding customer digital assets in the U.S. would be required to post independently audited proofs-of-reserves on a quarterly basis, making them public through publication on the Treasury Department\u2019s website. If firms cannot find an auditing firm to verify that it holds the assets it claims it does, then another third-party firm could be used.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Failure to submit proofs-of-reserves would lead to civil penalties, with fines increasing each time a company fails to comply.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tillis added that he hopes to introduce the bill \u201Cover the next week or so,\u201D after securing support from the Democratic offices he and his staff are in talks with.&nbsp;<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
