The number of specialist crypto hedge funds is estimated at more than 300 globally, with their pace of creation accelerating during the past two years.","Most traditional hedge funds are still just dipping their toes, according to the report, as 57% have less than 1% of total assets under management (AuM) in digital assets.&nbsp;Still, for 20% of these funds, digital assets represent between 5% and 50% of AuM. Furthermore, two-thirds of funds currently investing in digital assets intend to deploy more capital into them by the end of this year.","For specialist crypto hedge funds surveyed, the average AuM more than doubled to about $59 million from $23 million the previous year. From 2020 to 2021, the percentage of crypto hedge funds with AuM exceeding $20 million increased to 59% from 46%.","Crypto hedge funds continue to achieve strong growth in spite of crypto\u2019s volatility.&nbsp;PwC\u2019s report said the median crypto fund returned +63.4% in 2021. Still, this was significantly off the +127.55% median return of 2020.&nbsp;","Most crypto hedge funds traded Bitcoin (BTC) at 86%; followed by Ethereum (ETH) at 81%; Solana (SOL) at 56%; Polkadot (DOT) at 53%; Terra (LUNA) at 49% and Avalanche (AVAX) at 47%.","While more traditional hedge funds are investing in crypto, some remain hesitant.","Still, the number of traditional hedge fund managers not investing in digital assets is shrinking, down to 62% of respondents from 79% a year earlier.","Regulatory uncertainty seems to be the key issue for hedge funds, whether or not they are currently invested in digital assets. Lack of regulatory and tax clarity was cited as a top challenge by 89% of hedge fund managers who currently invest in digital assets. For managers not currently investing in crypto, regulatory uncertainty was ranked as a main obstacle by 83%.","The PwC report shared results of survey-based research conducted in the first quarter of 2022, produced together with the Alternative Investment Management Association and Elwood Asset Management (now part of CoinShares).","Â© 2023 The Block.
