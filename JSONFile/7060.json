Solana's Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal are also investing in Asymmetric, alongside CMS's Dan Matuszewski, FTX, Circle, and former Coinbase president Asiff Hirji. Tiger Global's founder Scott Schleifer is also an LP.","Kyle Samani and Tushar Jain of Multicoin are also investing.&nbsp;","\"We're excited for Circle Ventures to be an investor in Asymmetric, one of the most forward thinking funds in crypto,\" noted Circle's Jeremy Allaire.&nbsp;","CMS's Matuszewski put it more simply:&nbsp;\"I'm long Joe.\"","McCann, for his investments, however, won't always be \"irresponsibly long.\" If the fund has exposure to a token via a specific token deal, it's going to be relative pragmatic.&nbsp;","\"Let's assume we get 10% token allocation and if it is up 100% out the gate, you would be irresponsible not to take out your principle. This is acting as a fiduciary to our LPs.\"","That's an interesting position to take in a market where many funds rode the wave to riches on one protocol or token bet.&nbsp;","Asymmetric will be split into two vehicles: a venture investment fund and a liquid one. The former will go head-to-head with the likes of Paradigm and Multicoin on securing allocation in token deals, while the former will be run somewhat akin to a Wall Street hedge fund. To that end, it will leverage Wall Street's most complex instruments.&nbsp;","\"The purpose of the liquid fund will be to manage liquidity with a level of sophistication most investors don't have,\" he said.","For instance, the fund may see something like ether as undervalued. Rather than simply purchasing more ETH over-the-counter, the fund might express such a view through options.&nbsp;","\"If ETH rips towards $10,000 and we bought end-of-year call options, that is a way better use of tools to express that view,\" he said.&nbsp;","In McCann's view, most of crypto's venture funds and new incumbents from San Francisco's Market Street have not leveraged these Wall Street tools.&nbsp;","\"TradVC typically never had to manage a liquid book. In crypto, you have to,\" McCann said.&nbsp;\"Most funds would just buy ETH.\"","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
