In a statement to The Block, CEO Adam Reeds highlighted Africa as a noteworthy growth market for the startup.","\u201CWe are particularly excited about the adoption we are seeing in Africa,\u201D said Reeds. \u201CSo we intend to use our additional resources to expand deeper into growth markets that can truly benefit from bitcoin's properties as a savings asset.\u201D","Founded in 2018, the Canada-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/2684\/meet-ledn-canadas-first-bitcoin-backed-lender\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ledn provides<\/a> bitcoin savings accounts and bitcoin-backed loans, among other services. Reeds said Ledn is already profitable, but needed the capital to \u201Cdouble-down on our growth.\u201D","Ledn has \u201Cthousands of active clients,\u201D co-founder Mauricio Di Bartolomeo told The Block, adding that the top five markets based on revenue are Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Canada, and the U.S.","The startup is preparing to launch a new, no-fee crypto trading service in Colombia next week, according to Bartolomeo. \u201CFrom there we will enable the trade feature market by market,\" he added.","This is an \u201Cincremental\u201D service and not core to Ledn\u2019s profitability, Reeds told The Block. \u201CIt is just important to allow our clients to do more with their bitcoin in one place. Clients will be able to trade directly from our savings accounts, so they will earn interest while they are not trading. Ledn will earn a small spread by providing a time-locked price guarantee.\"","As part of its expansion plans, Ledn also looks to more than double its headcount, from 12 people to 30, by June, Reeds told The Block. He added that the firm is hiring across engineering, legal, compliance, marketing and finance functions.","The seed extension round brings Ledn\u2019s total funding to $3.8 million, said Reeds. The firm previously raised an undisclosed amount of debt capital to fund its bitcoin-backed loan portfolio.","\u201CLedn borrows from institutional partners to fund its bitcoin-backed loans (no debt is borrowed for corporate operations - we are fully funded through equity and existing cash flows),\u201D said Reeds. \u201CWe have not yet disclosed the size of our bitcoin-backed loan portfolio, but will have exciting news to share shortly about our growth.\u201D","Looking ahead, Ledn plans to raise between $10 million and $20 million in a Series A funding round later this year, according to Reeds."],"hashtag":["BITCOIN"]}
