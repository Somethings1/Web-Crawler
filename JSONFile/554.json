It was done to check the performance of the project\u2019s Nord Engine, which Layer N says was designed to enable a rollup to support high trading activity.&nbsp;","While the testnet hit a peak of 120,000 transactions per second, Layer N noted that it was able to handle 20,000 transactions per second over a sustained period.","Layer N CEO and co-founder Dima Romanov said the goal is to launch multiple optimized rollups, including its own version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. He added that this would be compatible with the Nord Engine.","Looking further ahead, he imagined that developers creating exchanges on Layer N would be able to build native integrations that can plug into them. \u201CImagine if centralized exchanges we are all familiar with could allow developers to build applications directly on top of them. That\u2019s what we are enabling,\u201D he said.","Layer N uses EigenDA to store batched transaction data as part of being a rollup. This is cheaper than storing it directly on the Ethereum mainnet.&nbsp;","In September 2023, Layer N <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/250785\/ethereum-layer-n-founders-fund-peter-thiel\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $5 million<\/a> in a seed round co-led by Founders Fund and dao5. <span data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Other investors in the round included Kraken Ventures, Mirana Ventures, GSR and Amber Group.<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
