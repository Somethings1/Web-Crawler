Ark had previously filed for a similar fund on April 25 with 21 Shares.","\"While it looks much like previous ETF filings, BlackRock worked with Nasdaq to distinguish its application with a unique surveillance-sharing agreement designed to prevent the risk of bitcoin-related market manipulation,\" Elmandjra said. \"Based on our research, however, other applicants will be able to amend their filings with similar agreements at little cost.\"","The price of bitcoin has surged since the BlackRock filing, rising 15.3% over the past week.
