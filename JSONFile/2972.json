Another, crypto fund BlockArk CEO Allen Su, said his fund lost 50% through its investment, according to a screenshot shared with The Block.&nbsp;","These investors also formed a new group chat to discuss plans to recover their losses from Troy, with Wang claiming that he would take legal action against the project.&nbsp;","The market performance of Troy's native token, TROY, might be one of the reasons that precipitated the investor uproar.&nbsp;","Last August, Troy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chainnews.com\/articles\/853933987788.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> \"several million dollars\" from BlockVC, Consensus Lab, NGC Ventures and others.

TROY fell to $0.001 during the Black Thursday market crash in March.&nbsp;","Several investors highlighted in their messages that Troy's relationship with BlockVC was cause for concern and triggered Wang's fraud allegations.","As Wang alleged, BlockVC was not only an investor of Troy but also the company that runs the project. The fund then convinced several investors to put money in Troy without disclosing its relationship with the project.&nbsp;","\"A few people from Block VC packages a Troy project and bought it themselves, but nobody called them out,\" Wang said.&nbsp;","Several investors alleged that they only put money in Troy because of BlockVC, according to screenshots reviewed by The Block.
