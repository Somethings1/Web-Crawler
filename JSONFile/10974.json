The promise of spot Bitcoin ETFs gaining approval have helped buoy a rebounding crypto market.","The SEC used more or less identical language in a second filing in which the agency explained its decision to also delay ruling on a rule change related to Grayscale's proposed Ethereum futures ETF. A ruling in this case will also be made by the first of the new year, said the SEC.","Grayscale's filing for the ETF <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/253885\/grayscale-ethereum-trust-spot-eth-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">came shortly<\/a> after the SEC cleared the way for the first Ethereum futures ETFs. Both VanEck and ProShares have also launched Ethereum futures-based ETFs.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
