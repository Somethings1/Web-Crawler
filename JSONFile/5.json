Set around April 20, this event will cut the mining reward for a Bitcoin (BTC) block from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. <\/strong>","Analysts like Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Cowen, and Peter Brandt forecast a potential downturn in Bitcoin\u2019s price post-halving.","Arthur Hayes, a seasoned voice in the crypto sphere, <a href=\"https:\/\/cryptohayes.medium.com\/heatwave-68dc6ccb3d21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">presents<\/a> a complex view of the Bitcoin halving. Despite the general optimism, he predicts a market downturn. ","\u201CThe narrative of the halving being positive for crypto prices is well entrenched.
