Currently, the number of RootData API customers has exceeded 30, covering various scenarios including task platforms, media, wallets, AI robots, etc.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moving forward, RootData will further focus on the organic integration of on-chain and off-chain data, continuously iterate product functions and experiences, and explore diversified monetization scenarios, such as primary and secondary market transactions, membership models, etc.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tony, a partner at NLVC, expressed that the RootData team has impressive data aesthetic capabilities and strong execution power.
