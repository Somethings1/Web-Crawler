The error led to purchasing the memecoin at $3 per unit, several times higher than its market rate of $0.2 at the time.","This resulted in a back-running opportunity for MEV operators who quickly made moves to capitalize on the opportunity. Back-running is a specific type of MEV strategy that involves capitalizing on the temporary price movements caused by another transaction.","Back-running bots constantly monitor the mempool, which is a holding area for unconfirmed transactions on the blockchain. These bots look for target transactions and prepare their own transactions to follow. 2Fast alone made nearly $1.8 million, but on-chain data shows that other bots also got a piece of the cake.","MEV was made possible on Solana after Jito Labs developed the Jito Block Engine, an off-chain blockspace auction system where traders can submit transaction bundles along with a bid for their inclusion in the blockchain. This mechanism is intended to enhance the reliability of transaction execution on the Solana network.","SOL earned from <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/ilemi\/jitosol\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MEV tips<\/a> go to validators running the Jito client on Solana.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/solana\/jito-validator-tips\/embed\" title=\"Jito Validator Tips\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
