To obtain a \u201CWorld ID,\u201D users must scan their iris with a device known as an \u201COrb.\u201D Compatible apps, like Worldcoin\u2019s own wallet application, can leverage Worldcoin\u2019s network of authenticated users to tailor their services and root out bots.","In his blog post, Buterin argues that this system has potential issues with privacy, accessibility, centralization, and security.","Read more: Worldcoin Releases Tokenomics, Report Geofenced for Some Countries","Buterin argues first that scanning one's iris could potentially release more information than intended. For instance, if someone else scans a World ID holder's iris, they can run it against the Worldcoin database to determine \u2013 at the very least \u2013 whether that person is in the system. In addition, Buterin says World IDs won\u2019t be readily accessible to everyone, since getting ahold of an \u201COrb\u201D device can be difficult.","Furthermore, the \u201COrb\u201D is a hardware device, and Buterin alleges that \u201Cwe have no way to verify that it was constructed correctly and does not have backdoors.\u201D He adds that \u201Cthe Worldcoin Foundation still has the ability to insert a backdoor into the system, letting it create arbitrarily many fake human identities.\u201D","Finally, Buterin expresses security concerns with Worldcoin given that users' phones could be hacked, and they could be coerced into giving out their iris scans.","Buterin acknowledges that there is no perfect solution to overcoming these issues. \u201CThere is no ideal form of proof of personhood,\u201D Buterin writes. \u201CInstead, we have at least three different paradigms of approaches that all have their own unique strengths and weaknesses.\u201D Those three approaches are known as social-graph-based, general-hardware biometric, and specialized-hardware-biometric solutions (like Worldcoin).","Buterin also adds that Worldcoin has taken certain steps with its hardware that make it superior to more traditional identification schemes \u2013 particularly when it comes to user privacy. \"It does seem like specialized hardware systems can do quite a decent job of protecting privacy,\" says Buterin. \"However, the flip side of this is that specialized hardware systems introduce much greater centralization concerns.\"","The newly-launched WLD token spiked earlier Monday by over 20% on major crypto exchanges, following Worldcoin\u2019s mainnet launch.","Read more: Worldcoin's Newly-Launched WLD Token Spikes Over 20% on Major Crypto Exchanges","Edited by Sam Kessler."],"entity":[{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Worldcoin Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Buterin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam Kessler","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Vitalik Buterin","Sam Altman","worldcoin","Open ai"],"authors":["Margaux Nijkerk"]}
