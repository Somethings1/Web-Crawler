Our company has successfully endured downturns in the past, and we are confident in our ability to navigate the current market turmoil.\"","Other bitcoin miners have similarly sold a significant portion of their bitcoin holdings recently. Bitfarms, for one, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/153294\/bitfarms-gives-up-3000-btc-to-pay-down-100-million-loan-from-galaxy-digital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">gave up 3,000 BTC to pay down part of a $100 million loan<\/a> from Galaxy Digital.","By the end of June, Core Scientific had 1,959 bitcoin and roughly $132 million in cash on its balance sheet. Going forward, the company intends to continue selling some of its self-mined bitcoin to \"pay operating expenses, fund growth, retire debt and maintain liquidity,\" the statement said.","Meanwhile, in June, it generated 1,106 self-mined bitcoin \u2014 down 2.8% from the previous month. While the company deployed new miners last month, bitcoin production was impacted by a \"substantial increase in curtailment activity,\" meaning that they had to power down for a total of 2,472 megawatt-hours.","Daily bitcoin production actually went up by 14% in June, from 34.8 BTC per day at the beginning of the month to 39.8 BTC.","By the end of the month, Core Scientific had a self-mining hash rate of 10.3 exahash per second (EH\/s) and an additional 7.6 EH\/s in colocation services. The company aims to reach 30 EH\/s by the end of the year.","\"We remain focused on executing our plan, while taking advantage of distressed opportunities that may arise,\" Levitt said."],"hashtag":[]}
