Its USDC Growth Accounts transition has gone live today at the same 8.5% APY rate, with USDT to follow next month. Users can freely switch between the Transaction and Growth Accounts to ensure control over their assets, Ledn said.<\/span>","Ledn claims it offers the crypto industry\u2019s highest stablecoin yield, compared to current rates of up to 5.4% on DeFi lending platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/app.compound.finance\/?market=usdbc-basemainnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Compound<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.aave.com\/markets\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aave<\/a> and the Maker-powered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sparkprotocol.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Spark Protocol<\/a>. While crypto yields are down compared to 2021 bull market peaks, Ledn\u2019s 8.5% APY is also higher than the up to 5.5% currently available in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/select\/best-money-market-accounts\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">traditional money market funds<\/a> \u2014 a type of cash alternative consisting of short-term government debt securities like Treasury Bills.","\u201CWe have listened to the industry\u2019s demand for a new way to earn yield in a safer and more transparent manner,\u201D Ledn co-founder and CSO Mauricio Di Bartolomeo said. \u201CFor me, the yield combined with the collateralized status of these accounts makes this a great alternative to Treasury Bills.\u201D","Ledn\u2019s Growth Accounts come partly in response to the collapse of several centralized lending platforms in 2022 \u2014 including the bankruptcy of firms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/157483\/crypto-lender-celsius-to-declare-chapter-11-bankruptcy-cnbc?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Celsius<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/188915\/crypto-firm-blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlockFi<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/155990\/crypto-broker-voyager-digital-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Voyager Digital<\/a> \u2014 which severely impacted trust in the sector.","In an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/226267\/bitcoin-lender-ledn\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interview<\/a> with The Block in April, Di Bartolomeo said that the company successfully navigated the crisis by diversifying away from its initial sole partner, Genesis. Through introducing its Open Book Report and a revamped client dashboard, Ledn argues its Growth Accounts provide more transparency in how they generate yield.&nbsp;","Furthermore, the Growth Accounts are legally ring-fenced \u2014 meaning that users are only exposed to the counterparties generating their yield, are shielded if Ledn ever went bankrupt, and are not exposed to the risks of each type of account. For example, USDT Growth Accounts are not exposed to the risks of USDC Growth Accounts and vice versa.","Ledn also argued it offered a \u201Cbitcoin and stablecoin savings experience outside of exposing clients to the risks associated with decentralized finance protocols, which continue to be scarred by a consistent stream of hacks and exploits.\u201D","Last month, Ledn opened a crypto-native path to a \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247251\/ledn-parallel-crypto-native-cayman-islands-golden-visa\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Golden Visa<\/a>,\u201D joining forces with crypto real estate broker Parallel to enable investors to finance and acquire Cayman Islands properties by leveraging their digital assets.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
