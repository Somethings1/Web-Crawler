Users of liquid restaking keep their capital liquid while also retaining their Eigen points.","Kelp has converted these points into a token, opening up its separate on-chain market and a brand new cryptocurrency niche. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/277823\/crypto-projects-115b-points\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Other avenues for trading points<\/a> exist, like Whales Market and Pendle, but they have yet to convert points into tokens."],"hashtag":["ASSETS","DERIVATIVES","PROTOCOLS","RESTAKING"]}
