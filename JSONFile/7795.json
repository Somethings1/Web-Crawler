According to Nansen, these wallets likely include notable players such as top DEX traders, liquidity providers, and venture funds. These 80-odd smart money wallets hold over 47 million tokens ($103 million) \u2014 a 30% increase in their holdings since the year\u2019s start.&nbsp;","\u201CWhile the number of Smart Money wallets holding dYdX tokens has been flat since June 23, these wallets have been steadily increasing their exposure. Holdings have hit an all-time high of over 47.8 million tokens,\u201D Nansen analyst Martin Lee said in a statement shared with The Block.&nbsp;\u201CWe\u2019re also seeing net outflows of the token from exchanges over the last 30 days,\u201D he added, which potentially hints at increased holdings by traders.","Still, this is only a small portion of the total 1 billion dYdX token supply.

They will pay \"trading fees which will accrue to validators and their stakers.\"","\"The dYdX Chain will be a proof-of-stake blockchain network and, as such, if and when deployed on mainnet, it will require a Layer 1 protocol token for staking to validators in order to secure the chain and for stakers of the Layer 1 token to govern the network,\" d'Haussy added.","The dYdX governance token changed hands for around $2.19 at 7 a.m. ET \u2014 up over 9% in the past 24 hours, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/dydx\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinGecko<\/a>.","Founded in 2018, dYdX is currently the largest decentralized derivatives exchange, with a trading <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/exchanges\/dydx_perpetual\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">volume<\/a> of almost $590 million over the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.","Â© 2023 The Block.
