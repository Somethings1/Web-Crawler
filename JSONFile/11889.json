This is because there are two ways to file for trademark: 1A filings means actual use, where a company gives the government evidence of use for the trademark. Alternatively, the filing could be a \u201C1B\u201D filing, which means there\u2019s intent to use. In the case of 1B filings, the trademark filing is in place for future use but does not necessarily mean there are immediate plans.","The CVS filing is on a 1B basis, with plans to offer digital and virtual goods and prescription drugs, and health services in virtual and augmented reality.","\u201CAs the leading health solutions company, we\u2019re consistently enhancing our omnichannel health services to meet the needs of consumers when and where they want them, including at home, virtually and in the community,\u201D a rep from CVS told The Block in an email. \u201CWe\u2019re also regularly looking at new and innovative ways to engage consumers through a digital-first, technology-forward approach, which is why we recently made trademark filings related to virtual health care services, as well as other virtual goods and services.\u201D","CVS Health is the parent company of several well-known US-based businesses, including CVS Pharmacy and the insurer Aetna.
