The partnership brings together two red-hot markets and creates a new way for collectors to buy and own unique blue-chip collectible comics tethered to one-of-a-kind NFTs. Auctions will feature curated selections of some of the most sought-after comics in prime condition, kicking off with a run of the extremely rare first printings of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hubs.la\/H0X2VjP0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #1-4<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in CGC 9.4-9.8 condition, with a combined value upwards of $90,000.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Curio and InTrove\u2019s innovative approach combines the convenience, innovation and momentum of NFTs with the proven value of real physical collectibles. When a collector purchases <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hubs.la\/H0X2Vwb0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">InTrove NFTs on Curio<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> through the auctions, they will be the owner of a digital collectible tethered to a unique physical copy of an extremely rare, valuable comic book. The NFT provides the collector with a way to show off their collection digitally, sell or trade instantly with other collectors, and own a value-added, rare digital component to complement the already-rare physical item. Buyers can elect to store their items with InTrove partner Diamond International Galleries (with first six months of storage and insurance included) or take delivery of the physical copy in exchange for the NFT.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This new approach solves important problems for traditional and digital collectors. The collectible comics and original art market has seen appreciation of 200-1,000% since 2020, with no end in sight. More collectors are seeking ways to invest in these properties, and currently bear the responsibility to preserve, store and insure their items post-auction. Curio\u2019s new partnership with InTrove provides an option for the physical items to be held in secure custody while transactions can take place using the NFT as a proxy. At the same time, it offers digital collectors the security of owning a collectible that is backed by an item that has its own independent financial value.<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/hubs.la\/H0X2VjP0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The first auctions<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, beginning September 13, 2021, will feature Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #1-4, some of the rarest comics produced since the 1960s. There were only 3,000 items in the original print run and they are graded CGC (Certified Guaranty Company) 9.4-9.8. To get a sense of value, the most recent sale of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #1 in August went for $245,000 without the NFT element. Future auctions will include a curated section of high-grade and key comic issues from some of the industry\u2019s top dealers and collectors including Harley Yee, Josh Geppi and others.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCurio is focused on pushing the boundaries of what NFTs can mean for their collectors and our new partnership with InTrove is unlocking a brand new opportunity for fans of comic books and NFT collectors alike,\u201D said Juan Hernandez, CEO, Curio. \u201CNow there\u2019s a way for collectors to break into the burgeoning NFT market while simultaneously holding onto a piece of comic book history.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Curio will be the sole platform for InTrove auctions and will produce and mint each NFT with images of the specific collectible provided by InTrove.
