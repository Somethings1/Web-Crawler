This is my last day in the capital\u2014I\u2019m heading to Shanghai now and then back to the US. Almost immediately after my last post, the SEC announced enforcement action against Kik\/KIN.

While some projects have been able to work within this extremely hazy framework well, I think a lot of other projects will end up either moving to easier (mostly Asian) jurisdictions, or will simply be copied by teams in these less regulatorily encumbered areas. The fact that jurisdiction still matters at all of course means that these \u201Cdefi\u201D projects are not sufficiently \u201Cde\u201D yet\u2014over the next year or so I think a combination of decentralized namespace (Handshake), decentralized storage (Sia, maybe Filecoin), and an encrypted transport layer (Nym, another secret project I heard about a few days ago, maybe Orchid) may render a lot of these concerns moot by making it possible to anonymously ship truly censorship resistant easy to use defi GUI products, but for now the US seems to be a uniquely bad place to do this.","This week hunters competed for the clan key by attempting to create the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/clanchain?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;src=hash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">longest video Twitter thread<\/a>&nbsp;out of all the clans","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jimmy Song +&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinops.org\/en\/newsletters\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Optech<\/a>&nbsp;on Bitcoin [ed: sign up for their newsletter too! it\u2019s great!]<\/strong>","<a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinops.org\/en\/newsletters\/2019\/05\/29\/#proposed-transaction-output-commitments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Proposed new opcode<\/a>&nbsp;for transaction output commitments","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ihUQ4C42KUk\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Presentation: A Return to Fees<\/a>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tony from Kadena<\/strong>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kadena is building Pact, a formally verifiable smart-contracting language for financial applications, and Chainweb, a PoW blockchain that uses multiple chains in parallel to increase throughput.<\/em>","Kadena released Chainweb Testnet v1 on May 30.
