Babylon used Rari Capital's infrastructure to create lending markets called Fuse.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In February, the Babylon team launched lending markets on Rari Capital\u2019s Fuse platform, where it had asked users to deposit BABL tokens as collateral and borrow assets from it.
