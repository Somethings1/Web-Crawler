This occured through a bug that the platform had recently dislosed.","On January 17, Multichain revealed that it had found a critical vulnerability and had fixed it. It said that the bug affected six tokens, including wrapped ether (WETH).","But the problem is that the protocol couldn't fix the bug from affecting past users who had interacted with the protocol. Instead, this required users to manually go to their wallets and revoke permissions that they had previously given to the protocol. Multichain said that these users should do this immediately otherwise their assets would remain at risk.","It appears that many users have not done so and the bug is now being exploited.","\"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Someone is exploiting this literally *right now*.
