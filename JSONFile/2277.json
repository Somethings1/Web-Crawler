He said, assuming 500 people are laid off, each with an annual cost of 1 million yuan (~$143,000), it means an annual expenditure of 500 million yuan (~$71 million). \u201CCompared to Bitmain\u2019s profit, this cost is not large. Taking a step back, even if the profit is difficult, the company\u2019s current capital and asset reserves, the annual expenditure of 70 million yuan will be fully affordable,\u201D said Zhan.","Zhan was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/44989\/bitmain-co-founder-and-executive-director-micree-zhan-is-out-abruptly\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ousted<\/a> in October by Bitmain's other co-founder Jihan Wu.
