Instead, EDX will provide a platform where firms can execute trades between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.&nbsp;","The actual transfer of crypto and cash between parties to settle the trades takes place outside of EDX's platform. While EDX plans to launch a clearinghouse later this year to facilitate trade settlement, it intends to utilize third-party banks and a crypto custodian for holding customer assets. EDX's non-custodial approach aims to alleviate concerns over security and potential misuse of customer funds, avoiding conflicts of interest.","EDX won\u2019t directly serve individual investors but expects retail brokerages to route investors' orders to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on its platform \u2014 mirroring the stock market.","In addition to Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab, EDX has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169643\/charles-schwab-citadel-fidelity-digital-launch-digital-asset-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">backing<\/a> from Paradigm, Sequoia Capital and Virtu Financial.
