He said he had a \"good team\" handling the transaction.","The Binance CEO also predicted that regulators worldwide would scrutinize exchanges far more closely in the wake of the FTX collapse.","\"Regulators will scrutinize exchanges even more,\" Zhao wrote, telling his staff to ignore prices and keep their efforts focused on building products. \"Licenses around the globe will be harder to get. And people now think we are the biggest and will attack us more. But that's OK, we are used to being open and leaning into headwinds.\"","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
