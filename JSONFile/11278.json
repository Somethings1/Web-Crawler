Today, we turn our focus to Raft\u2019s latest development - the launch of the R stablecoin, the first US Dollar stablecoin collateralized solely by Lido Staked Ether (stETH).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Amidst the rapidly growing market cap of stETH, surpassing $13 billion, Raft has seized the opportunity to launch a lending protocol along with the R stablecoin. This launch presents a promising solution for Lido users in pursuit of capital-efficient ways to utilize their stETH. The protocol allows depositors to generate R, a decentralized USD stablecoin, using their stETH. <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"By accepting only stETH collateral, we eliminate fiat backing completely, providing R holders with peace of mind,\u201D<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> says co-founder David Garai.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another unique feature of Raft coming soon is its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/raft.fi\/one-step-leverage\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One-Step Leverage<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, a game-changer that enables users to gain up to 11x leverage on stETH in a single transaction, higher than what any other platform currently offers. Beyond providing a higher leverage ratio, Raft also simplifies the typically complex multi-step transactions required to gain leverage on stETH through other lending platforms like Aave or Maker.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Raft isn't just about launching groundbreaking features; it\u2019s also deeply invested in fostering a robust ecosystem through strategic collaborations and the active engagement of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/raft.fi\/frontend-operators\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Frontend Operators<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Raft is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the LSDFi landscape, which you can try by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.raft.fi\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">borrowing R<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> against your stETH.
