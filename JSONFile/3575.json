The partnership will enable the bank to develop decentralized applications that are both retail and institution facing, according to Nervos Networks co-founder Kevin Wang.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Some of the areas that CMBI is exploring with blockchain include the tokenization of assets, payments, identity verification, trading, and lending, according to Wang. However, the details and timeline of when these apps will be rolled out are still sparse, he said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CBasically what has mostly been under the traditional finance umbrella, they [CMBI] are going to experiment to put into decentralized applications,\u201D Wang added.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2019 has witnessed several banks jumping into the blockchain space, launching their own tokens such as the JPM Coin by JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo Digital Cash for interbank transfers. Meanwhile, CMBI has previously experimented with permissioned blockchain for internal purposes. This partnership with Nervos is the bank\u2019s first venture into the public blockchain space, according to a Nervos spokesperson. Compared to permissioned blockchains, the permissionless ones are \"ideal for inter-bank or external client-facing applications where security and multi-party verification are needed,\" said the spokesperson.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCMB are always early adopters of technology. They are way ahead of all the other banks that we know of, so they actually have done a lot of research internally, build pilot programs in that, and willing to jump in on the public side,\u201D said Wang.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nervos is public Proof-of-Work-based blockchain that aims to address the issues of both security and scalability with its two-layer design.
