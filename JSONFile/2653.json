The simple takeaway so far has been that institutional adoption is continuing to happen. It\u2019s a slow process that mostly so far has happened in the form of fund investment\u2014a bunch of endowments and a couple of pension funds have put decent-sized checks into crypto focused funds, who are currently deploying that money into a mix of venture-style bets and buying liquid cryptocurrencies. If you hold BTC, this seems like a good reason (among many) to just keep holding it\u2014my sense is that there\u2019s a lot of interest from large institutions, but that they are still somewhat hampered by a lack of regulated custodians, easy tie-ins to the tooling they are used to, etc.","Highlights: Decred lightning network goes live on testnet, Grin\u2019s UTXO set&nbsp;<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shrank<\/em>&nbsp;by 15% last week, Loom\u2019s Plasmachain Universal Transaction Signing allows users to seamlessly interact with L1\/L2 txs without having to really know or care which they are doing, and Decentraland releases cute Avatars.","No update from: Kadena, Spacemesh, Zeppelin, Theta.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jimmy on Bitcoin<\/strong>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinops.org\/en\/newsletters\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Optech<\/a>&nbsp;on Bitcoin [ed: sign up for their newsletter too! it\u2019s great!]<\/strong>","0.18.0 coming next week, big update then!","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">James from Summa<\/strong>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Summa builds tools to exchange crypto in a convenient and trustless fashion.<\/em>","This week we are wrapping up our share of development on a major partnership that will significantly improve interoperability between BTC and ETH.
