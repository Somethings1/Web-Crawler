This is the key development that core developers were looking for to see if the upgrade has gone to plan.","\"And we finalized! Happy merge all. This is a big moment for the Ethereum ecosystem. Everyone who helped make the merge happen should feel very proud today,\" <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1570306185391378434\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on Twitter.","The Merge has been in development since 2020 and is the second and final step in the transition to proof of stake.","It represents the official switch to using the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain for block production. The Merge also represents the shift from mining \u2014 using computing power to produce blocks for rewards \u2014 to validating, where it is no longer a competitive environment for validating transactions.","The Beacon Chain\u2019s launch in 2020 was the first step of The Merge. Ethereum developers wanted to break The Merge into two steps, giving optimal time to test the upgrade prior to fully switching to proof of stake.","An analogy to better conceptualize this from the <a href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/upgrades\/merge\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum Foundation<\/a> is \u201CImagine Ethereum is a spaceship that isn't quite ready for an interstellar voyage. With the Beacon Chain, the community has built a new engine and a hardened hull. After significant testing, it's almost time to hot-swap the new engine for the old mid-flight.\u201D","This reduces Ethereum's energy consumption by more than 99%. This means that Ethereum is now Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) compliant, which has been a regulatory concern dissuading businesses from participating in novel sectors such as DeFi and NFTs.","This has been an overarching <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/video\/recent-videos\/white-house-seeks-public-comments-on-crypto-esg-concerns\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">concern<\/a> as of late, largely centered around the carbon footprint of proof-of-work blockchains.","The Merge will also reduce Ethereum\u2019s issuance of ETH by roughly 90%, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/ultrasound.money\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ultrasound.money.<\/a>","Ethereum developers will now focus on growing the blockchain\u2019s scalability via rollups. Rollups, often referred to as layer 2 networks, bundle transactions on their own respective chains and settle them en masse on Ethereum. This divvying approach allows layer 2s to execute vastly cheaper and faster transactions, while still receiving the benefit of Ethereum\u2019s security (albeit with some compromises).","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For the latest news and updates about The Merge, make sure to check out our <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169846\/the-merge-live-coverage-of-ethereums-major-upgrade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">live coverage<\/i><\/a><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/i>","Â© 2023 The Block.
