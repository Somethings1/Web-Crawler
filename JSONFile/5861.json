Li.Fi urged Uniswap to prioritize the creation of a framework for assessing cross-chain bridges. This framework would see future Uniswap deployments on other chains happen with several bridge providers in the mix.","\u201CWhat we are proposing is a genuinely decentralized decision-making process that will end up with a solution utilizing multiple bridges,\u201D Li.Fi CEO Philipp Zentner told The Block.","Li.Fi said that a protocol the size of Uniswap should not rely on only one cross-chain bridge. The crypto bridge aggregator referenced its own research, <a href=\"https:\/\/gov.uniswap.org\/t\/rfc-update-deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-on-bnb-chain-binance\/19734\/92\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stating<\/a>, \u201CNo single AMB is tested enough to be considered a robust and secure solution that a project of Uniswap\u2019s size can solely rely on at this point.\u201D","AMB stands for arbitrary messaging bridges. These are a subset of crypto bridges that allow the transfer of data between EVM-compatible networks. Cross-chain bridges in general enable users to transfer crypto tokens across different networks.","Li.Fi suggested that Uniswap should propose the bridge assessment framework as a universal governance model. This could then be pushed as an Ethereum Improvement Protocol, setting a standard for other blockchain apps that use bridge providers.","Li.Fi\u2019s proposal, if adopted, could see the Uniswap deployment process on the BNB Chain pivot even further. The process has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/208095\/uniswap-foundation-charts-path-forward-amid-cross-chain-bridge-governance-debate\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">jumped through<\/a> several hoops amid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207297\/uniswap-temperature-check-spurs-feverish-backroom-maneuvering-among-crypto-vc-heavyweights\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">intense debate<\/a> among community members. Voting on the proposed deployment is in its second day with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tally.xyz\/gov\/uniswap\/proposal\/31\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">61%<\/a> of votes cast in favor of the proposed deployment with Wormhole as the only bridge provider.","There is a time crunch associated with the process. The Uniswap v3 business source license that prevents \u201Cvampire-forks\u201D like SushiSwap will expire on Apr. 1. Some delegates within the DAO have expressed a desire for Uniswap to finalize its cross-chain deployments before this date to prevent copy-cat projects from launching forks.","Li.Fi acknowledged the time constraint but stated that its recommended process could achieve long-term security for Uniswap.","Â© 2023 The Block.
