He made the remarks during an onstage interview at D.C. Fintech Week, a conference in Washington hosted by Georgetown University\u2019s Law Center.","He went on to compare the current state of the digital asset industry to the financial sector following the 2008-09 global financial crisis and Silicon Valley following the dotcom bubble burst. Brooks compared the collapse of Celsius, Terra, and Three Arrows Capital to the financial meltdown caused by overleveraging in parts of the financial sector during the crisis, which he argued represented a relatively small portion of the overall financial sector.","\u201CIt actually does not take much to blow up a financial market,\u201D said Brooks. \u201CThe truth is that the entire financial crisis was caused by a very slight uptick in defaults inside the Fannie Mae book.\u201D","\u201CThose things represented maybe two percent of crypto market and bitcoin fell 80%,\u201D added Brooks, speaking of the bankrupt crypto projects.","Â© 2023 The Block.
