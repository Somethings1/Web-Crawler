This difference is a major impediment to VCs operating in crypto, according to McCann.","\"There is a fragile reputation that a lot of folks in the industry may have concerned with, 'hey, I'm going to invest in this startup and we're in it for the long haul, and we're not going to ever take profits or sell the token,'\" McCann said. \"The problem with that is that's great for traditional venture capital, where typically you don't have a liquidity event for 10 to 12 years ... with crypto, we know that it becomes liquid in months. So the way that you manage a traditional venture capital portfolio isn't relevant anymore \u2014 you're actually managing a liquid portfolio.\"","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro and McCann also discuss:<\/span><\/i>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors <a href=\"https:\/\/trondao.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tron<\/em><\/a>, <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ledn.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ledn<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/em><\/b>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About Tron<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/strong><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TRON is dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps).
