It has a variable interest rate and is currently priced at 7.25%.","\"We are pleased to be closing on these debt facilities and believe that the combination of a term loan and revolver provide Marathon with exceptional flexibility as to our funding options,\u201D said Marathon CFO Hugh Gallagher.","Marathon announced Monday that it had no outstanding balance on the original loan, which was set to expire in October 2022.
