But while Gharegozlou was often celebrated in the media and business communities, behind the scenes many of his company\u2019s employees lived in fear of what they called the CEO\u2019s erratic nature. Several employees also found the first-time CEO\u2019s spendthrift ways imprudent, especially when the NFT market began to sour, Top Shot sales plummeted and layoffs at Dapper became common.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So when news spread of the Diplo party Gharegozlou hosted on the French Riviera aboard a 184-foot yacht \u2014 which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fraseryachts.com\/en\/yacht-for-charter\/tacanuya\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">costs more than<\/a> $200,000 a week to charter \u2014 it landed like a gut punch for several Dapper employees worried about their job security amid the turbulent market conditions.<\/span>&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Inside Dapper, much of the company was in turmoil.

Additionally, according to several former employees, the CEO\u2019s frequent private jet travel, pursuit of celebrity partners and spending on luxurious accommodations, which at one point included a $85 million Beverly Hills mansion, had people questioning Gharegozlou\u2019s priorities. The CEO\u2019s constant \u201Cbullying\u201D and \u201Cpublic shaming\u201D of employees only added to the fire, helping to stoke a toxic company culture.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block spoke to eleven current and former employees for this story, including both staffers who left of their own volition and those who did not.
