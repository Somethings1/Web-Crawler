However, derivative contracts and \u201Cunbacked crypto assets\u201D such as bitcoin and ether, are not in the scope of the DSS.","\u201CThe new Digital Securities Sandbox reshapes how we regulate by allowing firms to test regulatory changes using real world situations before these changes are made permanent. We hope this will be a more effective, collaborative and quicker way of delivering regulatory change,\u201D FCA Executive Director Sheldon Mills said in a statement. \u201CThe new sandbox also helps strengthen the U.K.\u2019s leading position as a global and vibrant financial center, by driving adoption of new technologies for trading and settling traditional assets.\u201D","Importantly, the DSS differs from the similarly named <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264389\/uk-finance-minister-announces-legislation-to-boost-the-nations-digital-asset-sector\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Digital Sandbox<\/a>, launched by the FCA in August 2023, to support firms in the early stages of digital product development.","The U.K. Treasury first consulted on the DSS in July 2023, with the U.K. government <a href=\"https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/media\/655c893ed03a8d001207fda1\/M8298_Draft_response_to_DSS_consultation_final.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">responding<\/a> to the consultation and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264389\/uk-finance-minister-announces-legislation-to-boost-the-nations-digital-asset-sector\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">outlining<\/a> plans to pass legislation to implement the initiative in November. The government subsequently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268212\/uk-introduces-new-regulations-for-its-digital-securities-sandbox\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">introduced<\/a> the new regulations in December, providing the nation's financial watchdogs rules for supervising the sandbox, which came into force on Jan. 8 as part of the U.K.'s Financial Services and Markets Act 2023.","Following the publication of the joint consultation paper today, feedback is open to interested parties until May 29, after which the BOE and FCA will issue a response and open up applications to the DSS \u2014 planned for summer 2024. The regulators anticipate the first cohort of DSS applicants will enter the sandbox initiative from as early as autumn.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DSS timeline.

According to the regulators, the DSS will be open to a wide range of firms \u201Cto maximize the opportunities to learn and for the U.K. financial system to benefit from private sector innovation and competing business models,\u201D which could lead to \u201Cfaster and cheaper ways for these securities to trade, settle and be utilized among financial market participants.\u201D","The initiative will run for five years, subject to entry limits, and could lead to new permanent regulations for trading and settling digital assets in the future.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
