Reginald Fowler was hit with charges of \"bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business\" by the USAO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/us-ag-charges-two-individuals-for-providing-shadow-banking-services-to-crypto-exchanges-including-bitfinex\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in an April 30 filing<\/a>.","The bank fraud counts carry a maximum sentence of 30 years and are related to Fowler's alleged failure to return $851 million as part of the relationship between his \"shadow bank\" and Crypto Capital, which is alleged to have outstanding obligations to Bitfinex. According to prosecutors:","\"Detention is appropriate for the following reasons: (1) the nature of the instant offense and the strength of the evidence against Defendant; (2) Defendant\u2019s financial resources and ties to other countries; (3) evidence that Defendant has already taken steps to impede this investigation; and (4) evidence of Defendant\u2019s involvement in other criminal schemes. For these reasons, among others, Defendant is an atypical white collar defendant and poses a significant flight risk.\"","The government alleges that Fowler was central to the scheme that reportedly impacted Bitfinex and therefore has significant means to flee the country:","\"Defendant has access to millions of dollars in bank accounts around the world. The government, through email search warrants, has obtained a document entitled \u201CMaster US Workbook,\u201D which details the financial operations of the scheme as of January 2019. This workbook indicates that the scheme had received over $740 million in 2018 alone. It lists approximately sixty different bank accounts, held at both domestic and international banks, with a combined account balance of over $345 million as of January 2019.\"","The USAO asserts that Fowler has all but unlimited means to exist indefinitely outside of the U.S. -- and is likely to face additional criminal and legal proceedings. As a result, they requested Fowler be detained.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
