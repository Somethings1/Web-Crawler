In 2020, it was announced that officials from the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankofcanada.ca\/2020\/01\/central-bank-working-group-cbdc\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">would oversee a six-strong group of central banks<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, including the BOC, as they pool together research on CBDC use cases.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yet Dinesh Shah, the BOC\u2019s director of fintech research, told The Block in an interview last week that reaching consensus on CBDC implementation with other central banks is \u201Cnot a central focus\u201D \u2014 unless the bank chose to explore cross-border payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ultimately, Shah says that decisions regarding a CBDC are specific to individual countries due to their differing payment systems. He explains that the six-strong group formed in early 2020 primarily exists to pool research.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CEven if there\u2019s no consensus, that open sharing of ideas is very valuable,\u201D he adds.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In Canada, research on this topic began around 2010, with Shah joining as the BOC\u2019s first technologist in 2014. While one of his first tasks was explaining the technology behind bitcoin to policymakers and economists, the catalyst for the research was not crypto itself, but the decline of cash.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAt the Bank of Canada, what [the research] really came out of was not really thinking about cryptocurrencies, but it was more what was happening with cash demand,\u201D he says. \u201CLike in many other countries, there's been this steady decline in everyday cash use, even though there's been an increase in the amount of cash out there in the economy.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Shah stressed that no formal decision has been made to issue a Canadian CBDC. It\u2019s still quite early days, he says \u2014 so much so that the role of blockchain technology, decentralized digital ledgers that underpin the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, in designing any CBDC is not clear.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blockchain technology \u201Cis not a given but it\u2019s still on our list of potentials,\u201D he says, noting that he has displayed some skepticism in the past about its fit with a retail CBDC.
