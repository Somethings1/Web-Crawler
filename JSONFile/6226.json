Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is eyeing a Republican presidential primary bid, just filed a bill to ban CBDCs in his home state. Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a potential vice-presidential pick in 2024, recently used a veto to rail against a possible CBDC.","Elsewhere, conservative Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah, reintroduced bills to ban CBDCs at the federal level, along with House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn.","And Vivek Ramaswamy, a long-shot Republican presidential hopeful and outspoken critic of ESG investing, has turned the digital dollar into a campaign trail issue in Iowa, the first presidential caucus state.&nbsp;","Central bank digital currencies are the latest crypto policy issue to grab the attention of the GOP, in no small part due to China's introduction of a CBDC several years ago. The Biden administration has formed an interagency task force to study issuing a CBDC, a subject the Federal Reserve has considered for years. Broad questions and critiques remain about privacy concerns and government disruption of the traditional banking sector.&nbsp;","\u201CFears of CBDCs can be quickly abated if Congress would just pass a bill to prohibit the federal government from issuing them,\u201D said Bryan Bashur, federal affairs manager for the conservative nonprofit Americans for Tax Reform and a former Cruz staffer.","DeSantis is using the specter of a digital dollar as political ammunition against President Joe Biden. The Florida governor slammed the Biden administration when he released his CBDC bill last month.&nbsp;","\u201CThe Biden administration\u2019s efforts to inject a centralized bank digital currency is about surveillance and control,\u201D&nbsp;DeSantis said in a statement. \u201CWe will not adopt policies that threaten personal economic freedom and security.\u201D","That frame stems from when China made waves as the first country to use a CBDC and, in the process, raised concerns over how technology and economic policy could be used to exert control over citizens. More than a dozen countries have taken steps toward full-fledged central bank digital currencies this year, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlanticcouncil.org\/cbdctracker\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Atlantic Council<\/span><\/a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The U.S. Treasury Department is <a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy1314\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">evaluating<\/span><\/a> whether a CBDC is \u201Cin the national interest,\u201D Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang said last month. Faster payments are a potential goal for a U.S. digital dollar, though the Federal Reserve says it will roll out a non-digital currency payments service. Regional Fed banks in New York and Boston have experimented with digital dollar transactions.","The Treasury Department, which did not respond to a request for comment, assembled an interagency working group to develop policy recommendations on CBDCs. Still, creating and launching one would likely require a new law. The Biden administration has said that a digital dollar would need support from Congress, the executive branch and the public.&nbsp;","\u201CWhile at this point no one could mistake the Biden administration for being particularly enthused by digital assets, the administration\u2019s most recent economic report noted that \u2018crypto-assets appear to be here to stay,\u2019\u201D said Miller Whitehouse<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">-<\/span>Levine, the CEO of DeFi Education Fund, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group in Washington, D.C. \u201CThis statement represents an important shift in tone.\u201D<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The DeSantis bill to ban central bank digital currencies in Florida is moving through the state legislature. The proposal would update the state commercial code to prohibit using a federally adopted CBDC as money. The bill also proposes outlawing any CBDC issued by a foreign reserve or foreign-sanctioned central bank.","Florida isn\u2019t the first state to seek crypto-related changes to the commercial code. Noem, a rumored potential vice-presidential pick who could run for president herself, blasted the possibility of a U.S. CBDC when she vetoed a crypto-related change to her state's commercial code law.","Even if the Florida bill passes, it faces strong scrutiny thanks to a portion of the U.S. Constitution known as the Supremacy Clause. The clause establishes that federal law generally takes precedence over state laws, which could make DeSantis' effort more symbolic than substantive.&nbsp;","\u201CThe legislature contemplates there may be some legal challenges to this,\u201D said Sean Gellis, a crypto lawyer based in Florida. \u201CIf the federal government says, \u2018Yeah, this is our currency now,\u2019 the Supremacy Clause and the limitations on state government in the federal constitution very well might prevent this law from standing.\u201D<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","As digital assets become more popular, banning central bank digital currencies may not be so simple. Stablecoins issued by the private sector will need clearer regulation if digital assets rise in popularity, Gellis said. U.S. House lawmakers drafted a stablecoin regulation bill last year and hope to release a new version later this year.","\u201CIf digital currencies are going to happen, and you're going to have them around the world, and you say no central bank digital currency, okay, then we're gonna have to get the private sector stuff right. You're gonna have to get stablecoins that are truly stable and regulated,\u201D Gellis said.","Republicans are hardly the only group worried about how CBDCs could erode privacy. An array of nonprofit organizations have penned guidelines on how the government should address a possible CBDC, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Demand Progress and the pro-crypto Fight for the Future.","Rohan Grey, an assistant professor at Willamette University who testified before Congress on the digital dollar, believes Republicans are more interested in pushing a digital currency to the private sector rather than protecting privacy.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CThere was a pretty clear articulation of a left case for privacy and public money, I think, long before they came along,\u201D Grey said. \u201CWhether it's becoming a partisan issue is really a question of who you want to sort of listen to.\u201D","Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have drafted CBDC bills.","Rep. Steven Lynch, D-Mass., plans to reintroduce a <a href=\"https:\/\/lynch.house.gov\/_cache\/files\/5\/0\/500162f9-7fce-4981-b9b9-16bf22e10ede\/83EE032381B9431A65DE22B213D3A10E.rep.-lynch-ecash-act-fact-sheet.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bill<\/span><\/a> he filed last year to develop a digital dollar that would \u201Cincorporate key security and functionality safeguards into the e-cash system\u201D that is typically associated with using physical cash. Lynch is the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion.","Patrolling privacy issues shouldn\u2019t be a partisan battle, said Whitehouse-Levine, the DeFi Education Fund CEO.","\u201CA CBDC\u2019s potential for misuse is quite potent. It could severely encroach on Americans\u2019 right to financial privacy and enable an unprecedented degree of control over individuals\u2019 private transactions,\u201D Whitehouse-Levine said. \u201CProtecting the right to financial privacy is a non-partisan issue.\u201D<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
