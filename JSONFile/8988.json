Like Terra, Tron has also signalled its intent to establish a reserve of $10 billion in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to support the new stablecoin.","Tron <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/142867\/justin-sun-to-launch-algorithmic-stablecoin-usdd-on-tron-will-use-10-billion-of-crypto-as-collateral\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">unveiled its plan<\/a> to roll out USDD on April 21. According to the announcement, the stablecoin will be available on Ethereum and BNB Chain via the BitTorrent network\u2019s cross-chain protocol.","In an interview, Tron founder Justin Sun told The Block that he sees USDD as becoming \u201Cjust like bitcoin\u201D \u2014 except that its price, in theory, will be aligned with that of the US dollar. Both he and Terra founder Do Kwon have spoken of their desire to build stablecoins that are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/144858\/very-stable-geniuses-the-race-to-build-regulation-proof-stablecoins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">resistant to interference<\/a> by regulators.","\u201CWe need to make the stablecoin in the industry just as decentralized as bitcoin, so no one can touch it,\u201D Sun said. \u201CI believe in the next five to 10 years, crypto will be settled by decentralized stablecoins.\u201D","Asked how these stablecoins would combat criminality, Sun pointed to data tools like Chainalysis. He does not believe, he added, that freezing assets is an effective remedy to money laundering.","A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) named Tron DAO will manage USDD. Tron DAO will administer a reserve with a 30% interest rate, according to the April 21 announcement.","It will also oversee an effort to amass $10 billion in bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies for the proposed reserve. Sun likened the DAO to the Luna Foundation Guard, a Terra-boosting non-profit based in Singapore that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/134871\/luna-founation-guard-token-sale\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $1 billion<\/a> for a reserve through a sale of LUNA in February. The idea is that these reserves will step in to help preserve their respective stablecoins\u2019 pegs, should a sudden crypto market slump cause the algorithmic method to fail.","\u201CThe number one priority is just to try to stabilize USDD,\u201D said Sun. \u201CWe want to keep USDD stable and win people\u2019s trust.\u201D","Sun said Tron would collaborate with institutional investors \u2014 mainly crypto exchanges and venture capitalists \u2014 to get USDD\u2019s reserve off the ground, although he did not name them. Tron DAO will also contribute TRX, bitcoin, ether and some established stablecoins to the reserve, he added.","\u201CWe already have the liquidity for the first round. I think right now, for the next six to twelve months, we already have enough [in the] reserve to kick everything off. But, of course, we will reserve the option to get more financing in the future,\u201D said Sun. \u201CKicking off in May, I think we\u2019re probably going to have $1 billion put into the reserve.\u201D The Block has not been able to verify whether that $1 billion has indeed materialised.&nbsp;","Terra\u2019s UST is the pioneer among what is now a group of \u2018protocol-native\u2019 stablecoins, with total issuance of UST now at above $18 billion, according to The Block Research. That compares to around $83 billion in Tether\u2019s USDT, and $44 billion in Circle\u2019s USDC.","Shortly after Tron\u2019s announcement in April, Near Protocol <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/143275\/usn-stablecoin-goes-live-on-near-protocol\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced the launch<\/a> of a decentralized stablecoin named USN, confirming earlier reporting by The Block.","© 2023 The Block.
