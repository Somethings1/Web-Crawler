The attacker then deposited BNB tokens on the Venus lending protocol to borrow <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234169\/venus-protocol-faces-liquidation-on-150-million-bnb-loan-as-team-takes-preemptive-action\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$150 million<\/a> worth of stablecoins.","The loan position using collateral of 900,000 BNB had remained untouched since the hack until now.","Since last year, the tumbling crypto prices have reduced the health rate of this overcollaterized loan position, bringing it dangerously close to its liquidation point. The Venus team, working with the BNB Chain core team, has carried out manual liquidations to prevent large amounts of BNB from being auto-liquidated and subsequently sold off on the market.","The details of last year\u2019s exploit reveal a calculated manipulation of security proofs by the attacker. The hacker capitalized on a vulnerability related to the \u201Ciavl hash check\u201D within the BNB Chain's bridge, and the weakness allowed the attacker to mint 2 million BNB tokens valued at $560 million at the time of the exploit.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Correction: The earlier article incorrectly stated the liquidation amount as $60 million; it was actually half.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
