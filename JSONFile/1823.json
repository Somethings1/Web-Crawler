ICE will contribute $35 million to Bakkt\u2019s existing guaranty fund specifically for losses related to bitcoin contracts. Guaranty funds are usually required and administered by a state as a safeguard for if insurers are unable to pay policyholders.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis is not a normal practice in the clearing risk management system,\u201D says Ricky Li, co-founder of trading firm Altonomy.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He took issue with the size of Bakkt\u2019s funds, which would have around $400 million in open positions at risk compared to the $35 million guaranty fund. Bakkt itself seems to acknowledge the inflated risk, with the materials provided by ICE explaining there are plans to increase the guaranty fund over time, after the launch.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meanwhile, the co-founder of a New Jersey crypto hedge fund agreed that it was low, but not \u201Calarmingly\u201D so.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Overall, the source added, the plan is still good enough to attract traders like themselves.
