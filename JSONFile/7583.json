Those wishing to build applications that incorporate crypto can do so using Saga\u2019s chainlets directly, or by relying on them as a scaling solution for another layer 1 or layer 2 blockchain.","Liao says that web3, as it stands, cannot deal with more \u201Cexperiential\u201D apps \u2014 especially those involved in gaming and entertainment. She points to network congestion, performance issues stemming from slow throughput and high gas fees as key limiting factors. Saga\u2019s chainlets, she says, can help developers overcome these.","With about 20 validators verifying transactions across of each of these through a shared security model, Liao says Saga can support as many as 1,000 chainlets in its current form. \u201CA lot of the innovation is going to happen around validator orchestration and making sure that we are balancing the compute cycle accordingly,\u201D she adds.","Saga is planning to launch its mainnet and token early next year. In the next few months, it will release an \"AlphaNet\" to begin onboarding developers and forging partnerships with infrastructure and gaming outfits.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
