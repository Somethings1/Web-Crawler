It is also not clear whether bitcoin mining stocks like Riot Blockchain, HIVE Blockchain, and Hut 8 Mining are part of the restrictions.","The HSBC spokesperson told The Block that the restrictions aren't new and have been in place since 2018.","It is unclear whether HSBC restricts all its customers worldwide from buying MicroStrategy stock or customers of select countries only.
