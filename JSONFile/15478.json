This cautious sentiment was echoed by the broader Consensus audience.","Among 169 attendees who answered an electronic survey during the three-day April conference, only 9% answered that it was unequivocally possible to design and build a surveillance-free government-backed digital currency. The largest proportion, 39%, agreed that doing so was technically possible but worried governments wouldn\u2019t allow digital currencies to operate with a guarantee of privacy.","This article is excerpted from CoinDesk\u2019s inaugural Consensus @ Consensus Report, the product of intimate, curated group discussions that took place at Consensus 2023.

(The session, which drew 135 participants, was conducted under the Chatham House rule.)","Some participants in the discussion at Consensus argued that embracing a digital dollar is vital for the U.S. to maintain the dollar\u2019s dominant role as the global reserve currency. Many suggested the nation will be forced to catch up to competitors that are already far ahead.","\u201CThe world will have CBDCs and stablecoins whether we like it or not, and whether the U.S. chooses to lead or follow,\u201D said J. Christopher Giancarlo, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, during a keynote address at Consensus.","\u201CDigital currencies that effectively protect financial privacy in lawful transactions will be the world\u2019s most desired,\u201D said Giancarlo, now executive chairman of the Digital Dollar Project, a group encouraging research and discussion of a virtual greenback.","Read More: The U.S. Should Lead the Digital Future of Money","Privacy was at the center of the discussion at Consensus, and participants hit on several suggestions for dodging a future dystopia.","Discussants at Consensus proposed that CBDCs use open source code, inspectable by anyone, and a transparent minting process that would discourage stealth inflation measures.","The group argued that sovereign digital money should strive to share the same privacy benefits as cash. One popular idea was that users maintain control of data that\u2019s collected about their financial activity, while the discussion also touched on the possibility that smaller, lower-risk CBDC transactions could be granted the highest level of privacy\u2026.","Click here to download the full Consensus @ Consensus report."],"entity":[{"type":"9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Digital Dollar Project","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Digital Future of Money","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Arry Yu","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chatham House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Giancarlo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"39%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"J.
