No account information or systems were impacted, and all customer accounts remain secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;","\"We are aware of two incidents during which bad actors obtained the names, email addresses, and\/or truncated (partial) phone numbers of certain Gemini customers from two third-party vendors that we use,\" the email noted, going on to say the firm had previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gemini.com\/blog\/protecting-our-customers-from-phishing-campaigns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mentioned<\/a> one of these scams. The exchange said it just recently learned of another one that occurred last fall.","The second incident involved \"bad actors\" who \"phished and tricked\" employees of a third-party vendor into providing logins to their platforms. The bad actors used the login credentials to access the names, email addresses, and in some cases, partial phone numbers of some Gemini customers.","\"We understand that these incidents may be part of a broader attack on crypto platforms by this group of bad actors,\" Gemini said in the email.&nbsp; The UK Information Commissioner's Office and the Irish Data Protection Commissioner have been informed.","Gemini did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Block.","Â© 2023 The Block.
