It\u2019s backed close to 200 startups, consistently ranking among the sector\u2019s most active venture funds, and just last August announced a raise of $200 million for its debut fund, with backers including billionaires Bill Ackman and Alan Howard, former presidential candidate Andrew Yang and industry heavyweights like Animoca Brands and Dragonfly Capital. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But Shima has had a harder time securing the services of an auditor, based on documents reviewed by The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Puerto Rico-based company \u2014 which was originally based in Delaware \u2014 has flirted with several accountancy firms, but after more than two years of feverish investment, it doesn\u2019t appear to have undergone a formal audit. <\/span>","A <a href=\"https:\/\/reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov\/reports\/ADV\/320929\/PDF\/320929.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">form ADV filed in May<\/a> this year suggests the fund<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u2019s annual statements are subject to an annual audit.

Prior to forming Shima, he spent time at Divergence Digital Currency and Struck Capital, two venture firms. He previously worked for New Enterprise Associates and Morgan Stanley.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The documents reviewed by The Block \u2014 many of them published as part of an ongoing court case involving Gao and his former employer Adam Struck \u2014 paired with comments from people familiar with Shima underscore its struggles to find an auditor.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An investor presentation from the Summer of 2021 suggests Shima tried to engage auditing firm Richey May &amp; Co. to perform tax and auditing services. Stephen Vlasak, a partner at Richey May, confirmed in an email that the firm had \u201Cnever been officially engaged or issued any audit reports for Shima Capital.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A slightly altered version of the same presentation suggests Shima then turned to BDO. Gao himself names BDO USA as Shima\u2019s \u201Cpotential auditor\u201D in a court filing. In a separate investor update in 2022, BDO Cayman was named as Shima\u2019s auditor. But the accountancy firm informed Shima in March 2023 that, after a policy change, the venture firm fell outside of BDO\u2019s risk parameters. BDO\u2019s U.S. and Cayman Islands units didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Next came Marcum LLP, which recently began appearing in Shima\u2019s regulatory filings. Marcum was engaged earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the matter, but the accountancy firm ultimately determined that Shima lay outside its risk parameters. Marcum didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On June 21, Marcum was <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2023-114?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> with \u201Csystemic quality control failures throughout the firm.\u201D Marcum agreed to pay a $10 million penalty to settle the charges.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">More than two years after Shima began investing in startups, its search for an auditor goes on.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A spokesperson for the company didn\u2019t respond to most of The Block\u2019s questions, except to confirm that Shima is currently engaging with multiple auditors and to point out that securing an auditor in the U.S. has been \u201Ca huge crypto industry-wide challenge,\u201D with formerly friendly outfits like Mazars and Armanino halting work in the sector after the disastrous collapse of FTX last year.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To be sure, Shima is not the first crypto VC to struggle to get accounts signed off.

Later, Struck countersued.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gao had been hired to help run Struck Capital\u2019s blockchain investments in 2016.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gao accused Struck of breaching the terms of their partnership. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Struck alleged, among other things, that Gao had stolen proprietary materials to start a competing firm, Shima. Gao had also taken a position at a Cayman Islands-based Special Purpose Acquisition Vehicle that Struck alleged had links with authorities in China. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In February of this year, The Financial Times <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/3da34c10-f886-4048-aaa9-eefa35d417a1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">examined<\/a> investor presentations in which Shima initially touted outsized returns on an investment in BitClout, a blockchain-based social media outfit, only to scrub that reference in a subsequent version.
