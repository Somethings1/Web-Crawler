Moving forward, it will not accept the product as collateral. The firm plans to announce this move later this week.&nbsp;","Responding to a tweet penned by CoinShare's Meltem Demirors, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince said that BlockFi \"directly holds zero GBTC.\"","\"We have a couple small loans (like sub $10M) w\/ GBTC as collateral that are in the process of winding down,\" he said.&nbsp;","Those loans have also been wound down.&nbsp;","The move is the latest by BlockFi to de-risk in an environment that has seen lenders scale back, hike rates, and generally act more conservatively.&nbsp;","It's particularly striking that BlockFi is moving on from GBTC considering it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/82445\/blockfi-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-gbtc-share\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">once<\/a> held more than 5% of the total supply.
