This concept abstracts blockchain away from the user experience. For example, in a blockchain network such as Near, users create and recover accounts using email addresses instead of writing down complex seed phrases.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe idea is that blockchains must be abstracted away from the user so they are not barriers to entry or participation,\u201D said Polosukhin.&nbsp;<\/span>","However, there may be a few issues to consider. During a fireside chat at BUIDL, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin raised a potential pain point of chain abstraction: as various chains become interconnected into a larger ecosystem, there could be a systemic risk of \u201Cdesensitization\u201D to security issues.","While Polosukhin did acknowledge that end-users might become even less aware of the security risks in chain abstraction, the Web3 space is still expected to move towards more decentralized, secure systems.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere are sophisticated counterparties that actually provide liquidity, doing routing and all of the work that is required to understand the layout and complexities of every chain, they are the ones who care,\u201D Polosukhin said. \u201CThey are the ones who will be pushing for decentralization, for security, and if they see that something is not, they'll just not service that.\u201D<\/span>","Buterin himself stressed the importance of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284908\/vitalik-buterin-account-abstraction\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">account abstraction<\/a>, which refers to the concealment of more technical details of on-chain applications for user-friendliness, yet remains heavily focused on providing both security and convenience.","On Wednesday, the Near Foundation launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284678\/near-foundation-chain-signatures\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chain Signatures<\/a>, a protocol that will allow users to sign transactions on third-party blockchains from a single Near account. Chain Signatures is live on Near\u2019s testnet, with its mainnet launch expected by early May.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe\u2019ll see a transition from centralized exchanges to more use of non-custodial, decentralized applications,\u201D the Near founder said. \u201CUsers will have access to everything in one, you know, you\u2019ll have multichain DEXs, lending, interacting with NFTs, and all kinds of experiences.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meanwhile, the Near co-founder said that blockchain technology can help prevent potential issues following the growth of artificial intelligence.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAI will be used for malicious purposes. It\u2019s just an eventuality, and we cannot stop that,\u201D Polosukhin told The Block.
