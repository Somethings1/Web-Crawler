The collective crypto market cap has slipped from $3 trillion to $1.3 trillion, and the collapse of TerraUSD last month has many in power <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/146691\/terra-disaster-fuels-work-of-congress-on-stablecoin-legislation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">looking askance<\/a> at the industry's ability to self-police.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moreover, while almost every crypto firm with a DC presence has put out some sort of statement of support for the effort of the bill, the reaction among the industry to its actual language is decidedly mixed.

No one individual party is pleased with the whole thing. But many parties within the industry are happy to have the mass attention on the bevy of issues facing them.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There is also the reality that such expansive issue-specific bills generally only pass into law in response to massively eye-catching and controversial events or with small sections rolled into larger omnibus bills.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Also factoring into the bill\u2019s reception is that congressional midterm elections are coming up in November, with an anticipated flip away from the current narrow Democratic majority in the House of Representatives and potentially the Senate as well.
