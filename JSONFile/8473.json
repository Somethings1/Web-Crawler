Unlike existing blockchain privacy tools, which often exist as separate entities, Nocturne integrates privacy directly into the account layer, functioning similarly to a smart contract wallet.","Nocturne is compatible with any DeFi protocol that represents state via output tokens, such as Uniswap swap tokens, Aave aTokens and Compound cTokens, the team said. It plans to extend this compatibility to a broader range of decentralized applications over time, creating private user accounts on Layer 1 and Layer 2 that are fully compatible with existing Ethereum accounts.","\u201CWith Nocturne v1's launch, we're moving away from the notion of a \u2018privacy tool.\u2019 Privacy should be embedded at the account layer and the v1 launch is the first step in making this possible,\u201D Nocturne co-founder and CEO Luke Tchang said. \u201COur goal is to ensure that everyone, from individual users to large institutions, can transact securely without exposing their financial history to the world. This is more than a product; it's a commitment to making Etherereum more accessible and enabling secure and private money over the internet.\u201D","Built on the belief that blockchain privacy will only become mainstream if it\u2019s integrated with the existing user experience, Nocturne\u2019s long-term vision is to \u201Cmake the experience so seamless that by default, every Ethereum user automatically has a private account which mirrors their public account,\u201D the team said.","Nocturne v1 is currently accessible through a dedicated private UI, offering functionalities like deposits, transfers to burner addresses, and private swaps and staking. Its future plans include transitioning to a more permissionless protocol.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
