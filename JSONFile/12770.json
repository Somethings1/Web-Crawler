The report was submitted on the crypto-focused bug-hunting platform Immunefi on June 27, but only recently disclosed.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Pwning.eth found a bug that impacted the entire Polkadot ecosystem and would allow hackers to steal over $200 million across Moonbeam, Astar Network, and Acala,\" a representative from Immunefi told The Block. \"They were all vulnerable to a bug that could have allowed malicious users to mint wrapped native tokens.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this case, wrapping is the process of converting the native crypto assets of blockchains into tokens that can be more readily supported by apps. It is done with the use of a smart contract, which holds the native tokens in escrow and issues the wrapped tokens to the user.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The vulnerability on the three chains could have been abused to mint unlimited wrapped tokens, including wrapped astar (WASTR) on Astar, wrapped moonbeam (WGLMR) on Moonbeam, and wrapped moonriver (WMOVR) on Moonriver, a sister network of Moonbeam.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The estimated value of assets exposed to the vulnerability was about $200 million across the three parachains, Immunefi said. After the vulnerability was reported, the three parachain teams worked to fix it and released an emergency patch before any malicious actors could exploit it. No funds were lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moonbeam and Astar, which have active bug-bounty programs with Immunefi, awarded $1 million to the ethical hacker through Immunefi.
