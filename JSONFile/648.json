The next halving event, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/280125\/bitcoin-halving-50-days\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">expected<\/a> in April, will see the reward subsidy for miners on the network drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. However, they continue to earn additional transaction fees for each block mined.","Furthermore, as activity in the Bitcoin ecosystem builds up through the development of additional Layer 2\/sidechain solutions, DeFi and NFTs, the analysts expected the current 5% of miner revenue generated from Bitcoin fees to rise to a sustainable 15%.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-miner-revenue-daily\/embed\" title=\"Bitcoin Miner Revenue (Daily, 7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Though bitcoin is already trading past its prior $69,000 all-time high, moving into price discovery, Chhugani and Sapra expect a further breakout post-halving, with the analysts now \u201Cmore convinced\u201D about their $150,000 bitcoin price target.","The analysts said they had built institutional flows into their estimates to arrive at the price target \u2014 initially expecting $10 billion of inflows this year following the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. on Jan. 11 and another $6 billion in 2025.","However, net inflows have already crossed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281618\/blackrock-ibit-spot-bitcoin-etf-10-billion-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$9.5 billion<\/a>, with an average run rate of approximately $370 million daily.
