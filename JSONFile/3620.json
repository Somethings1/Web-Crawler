It runs a number of different fund strategies including an early stage token strategy, a blockchain fund that is <a href=\"https:\/\/panteracapital.com\/funds\/blockchain-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a venture fund<\/a> investing in equity and a liquid token strategy.&nbsp;","The Block previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/180381\/pantera-capitals-early-stage-token-fund-is-down-71-this-year-exclusive\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that the early stage token fund was down 71% this year through the end of September. The dramatic drop in the fund's performance comes at a time when the majority of tokens and cryptocurrencies are down by 50% or more in the wake of a tricky macro environment with interest rates rising amid surging inflation.","Despite the underperformance this year, the early stage fund has still returned &nbsp;372% to investors since its inception.","The highest priority for the firm over the past few days has been checking in on the exposure its portfolio firms have to FTX, Veradittakit said.","\"After checking in, 95% had little to no issues,\" Veradittakit said. \"Of those that had issues, it was involving having treasury with FTX and we are helping them through options.\"","\"I feel for those, consumer and institutions, that have their assets locked in FTX right now,\" he added. \"There will probably be rippling effects that bleed into other assets associated with FTX, investments that they made, and other commercial relationships that they had. The company has hired top talent and had invested into some amazing companies so those are valuable assets for the industry and we should support those.\"","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This story has been updated to provide more detail on Pantera's exposure to FTX from the Blockfolio investment.<\/em>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
