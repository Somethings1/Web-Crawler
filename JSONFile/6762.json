However, when history repeats itself and average gas price spikes for months at a time, how prepared is your Dapp?<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Oracles are integral infrastructure, and their usage is intrinsically linked to the cost of gas, particularly on the Ethereum mainnet. Oracle providers, which foot the bill for this cost, learned the hard way during this high GWEI period that \u2018free-to-read\u2019 Oracles are unsustainable. For example, at the height of congestion, the daily gas cost for an Oracle spiked to over $41,000 for one specific 24-hour period.<\/span>","&nbsp;","The average gas price in Gwei is creeping back up. Source: Etherscan.io","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">New challengers have appeared, experimenting with different business models. Whereas longer-standing providers have diverted resources to newly created permissioned, revenue-generating product lines. As a result, the Oracle user market remains underserviced. Existing providers aren\u2019t successfully alleviating customer pain points around high cost and low transparency; and new challengers don\u2019t have the track record to provide the necessary confidence many DeFi protocols require.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This was a large part of the reason that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/chroniclelabs.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chronicle Protocol<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> was spun out of MakerDAO in September. Securing billions of dollars for the largest collateralized lending protocol in the space since 2017 has demanded the creation of a very tailored type of infrastructure that prioritizes gas efficiency and transparency, and can scale with network congestion.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The \u2018Oracle dilemma\u2019 dictates that there must be a trade-off between security (or decentralization) and cost. The more secure or decentralized you make an Oracle protocol (by increasing the validator set), the more it costs (in gas) to publish an Oracle outcome on-chain. The opposite is also true. The smaller the validator set and, therefore less secure you make the protocol, the less it costs to run an Oracle.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As on-chain TVL grows, the incentive for Oracle validator collusion to manipulate an Oracle also grows. This is one of many reasons why for Oracles to advance as tools of true and decentralized security, this trade-off cannot continue.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">New and old Oracle providers have attempted to solve this dilemma by rearranging the moving parts of an Oracle and dressing it up with marketing. Meanwhile, DeFi and other areas of the industry that rely heavily on Oracles suffer high-cost and high-latency Oracles, and the \u2018bull market\u2019 congestion is, again, fast approaching.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The \u2018Pull Oracle\u2019 model is often presented as a solution. However, without gas optimization, this solution also falls foul when Mainnet becomes congested. The Pull model can and is often set up in a way where the Oracle provider or Dapp doesn\u2019t pay the gas fee to update the Oracle. Instead, it is bundled into the transaction of the end user of the Dapp. Naturally, during high network congestion, this will lead to Dapps cannibalizing their user base as the cost of making an in-dapp transaction becomes unusably high due to spikes in gas prices for the Oracle.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The \u2018Pull Oracle\u2019 also doesn\u2019t make publishing data on-chain any cheaper; it simply slows the frequency down to an on-demand basis. Therefore the Oracle only costs less gas to run as long as updates are being \u2018pulled\u2019 less frequently than it would have \u2018pushed\u2019 them in the alternative model. For context, in the push model, data is pushed on-chain regularly based on customizable thresholds such as time or the value changing by 0.5%.<\/span>","A comparison with other Oracle providers utilizing on-chain metrics for gas usage.
