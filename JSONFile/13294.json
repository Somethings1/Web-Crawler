John Boozman, R-Ark., would allow for more direct market oversight, Behnam said.&nbsp;","\"So what I've called for is cash market authority in the digital asset, commodity space, and that would provide us legislative authority over cash markets. These would be the trading platforms, the intermediaries or the broker-dealer,\" said the CFTC chair. \"The custodians, potentially the data repositories, and those core infrastructure and components of markets.\"&nbsp;","The other major regulator in question is the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose leader <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177224\/gensler-supports-granting-cftc-more-power-over-spot-markets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gary Gensler suggested support<\/a> for expanding the CFTC's authority into spot markets earlier at the same conference.","Gensler was also among the regulators who voted to recommend legislation to grant U.S. officials more authority over digital commodity markets in a report issued by the Financial Stability Oversight Council last week.&nbsp;","Behnam acknowledged the CFTC would need more resources to accomplish the hypothetical expanded mission. The Stabenow-Boozman bill includes a user fee mechanism that would bring in more money to the CFTC, which often sees less funding from Congress than it requests. According to Behnam, that would pay for an expansion into the market oversight tools that the agency could use.&nbsp;","\u201CWe need to modernize our data infrastructure,\u201D including AI and machine learning for markets surveillance and enforcement, said Benham.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
