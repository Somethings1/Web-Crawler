Pegged to the price of the US dollar, it currently boasts a market capitalization of more than $12 billion, a number that has more than tripled since November last year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/total-stablecoin-supply-daily\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to The Block Research<\/a>.","LFG said that the reserve created through the $1 billion capital injection will effectively act as a \u201Crelease valve\u201D for UST redemptions; it is designed to ensure that the price of the stablecoin remains pegged to that of the dollar during sharp selloffs in crypto markets.","Unlike longer-established stablecoins, such as those issued by Tether and Circle, algorithmic alternatives do not use collateral to maintain their price.","Instead, stablecoins like UST keep their peg by relying on market incentives.","Here\u2019s an explanation of how the mechanism works, from Terra\u2019s website: \u201CWhen the demand for Terra is high and the supply is limited, the price of Terra increases. When the demand for Terra is low and the supply is too large, the price of Terra decreases. The protocol ensures the supply and demand of Terra is always balanced, leading to a stable price.\u201D","Users can mint new Terra-based stablecoins \u2014 of which UST is the largest \u2014 by burning LUNA tokens, and similarly, they can burn UST to mint LUNA. They are incentivized by the protocol to burn and mint in a way that ensures $1 worth of LUNA can always be traded for 1 UST, and vice versa.","The reserve has been introduced, however, to step in if selloffs in crypto markets erode those incentives. &nbsp;","\u201CThe reserve assets can be utilized in instances where protracted market selloffs deter buyers from restoring the UST peg\u2019s parity and deteriorate the Terra protocol\u2019s open market arbitrage incentives,\u201D said LFG.&nbsp;","The reserve will initially be denominated in bitcoin, which LFG believes is less correlated to the Terra ecosystem. There are plans to stock the reserve with other non-correlated assets over time, although it is not yet clear which assets will be used.","The basic premise is that this will ensure Terra\u2019s arbitrage incentives remain intact, even if demand for UST falls sharply.&nbsp;","Kanav Kariya, president of Jump Crypto, said that the reserve mechanism \u201Cis similar to how many central banks hold reserves of foreign currencies to back monetary liabilities and protect against dynamic market conditions.\u201D","The LUNA purchased by Jump and other investors in the $1 billion sale will be locked up over a four-year vesting period, according to LFG\u2019s announcement.","Singapore-based Terraform Labs, founded by Do Kwon and Daniel Shin in 2018, is the driving force behind the Terra blockchain.","The startup is backed by Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Galaxy Digital, Binance Labs, Dunamu, Huobi Capital and OKEx.
