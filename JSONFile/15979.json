This could eventually include things like being able to move around your \"social graph\" (a term of art for your following and followers) between interactive platforms.","Unveiled in February 2022, the Lens project raised $15 million from investors including IDEO CoLab Ventures, General Catalyst, Blockchain Capital and Palm Tree as well as individual contributions from Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams, OpenSea co-founder Alex Atallah, entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan and Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.","According to the press release, the Lens upgrade introduces new features including Profile Manager, which \"allows Profiles to be managed by one or more persons, multisigs and DAOs,\" along with Handles, which creates another identity layer that distinguishes \u201Cprofiles\u201D from \u201Chandles\u201D on the platform.\u201D","Another feature is \"Pay to read the rest\" where developers can post previews of posts and then set payment options to read the entire piece, which seems to draw influence from the paid \u201Csubscriber\u201D feature on X\/Twitter. Lens \"smart posts,\" another way to monetize content using the protocol, supports tipping, voting, subscribing and donating.","Edited by Daniel Kuhn."],"entity":[{"type":"Daniel Kuhn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"IDEO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alex Atallah","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Balaji Srinivasan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sandeep Nailwal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hayden Adams","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"General Catalyst","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Twitter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Polygon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$15 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Blockchain Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stani Kulechov","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Aave","Social Media","Lens Protocol"],"authors":["Bradley Keoun"]}
