Since June 12, the platform has seen customer withdrawals of nearly $198 million, triggered by the implosion of the TerraUSD stablecoin, Celsius's decision to halt withdrawals and Three Arrows Capital's woes, said Bathija.","Vauld is open to potential restructuring options. To that end, the firm has hired Kroll as its financial advisor and Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP as its legal advisors in India and Singapore, respectively.","\"Our management remains fully committed to working with our financial and legal advisors to the best of our abilities to explore and analyse all possible options, including potential restructuring options, that would best protect the interests of Vauld's stakeholders,\" said Bathija.","Vauld is currently also in discussions with potential investors, according to Bathija.","\"We intend to apply to the Singapore courts for a moratorium i.e. a suspension of the commencement or continuation of any proceedings against the relevant companies so as to give us breathing space to carry out the proposed restructuring exercise,\" he added.","Vauld (formerly Bank of Hodlers) is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/112912\/peter-theil-valar-crypto-platform-vauld-series-a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">backed by high-profile investors<\/a>, including Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and Pantera Capital.
