{"summary":"The $620 million Ronin exploit isn't the half of it; play-to-earn ain't free.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/layer2\/2022\/04\/04\/the-bigger-problem-with-axie-infinity\/","publishDate":"2022-04-04T18:14:55","id":15416,"type":null,"title":"The Bigger Problem With Axie Infinity","category":["Consensus Magazine"],"content":["On March 23, $620 million was stolen from the blockchain network associated with Axie Infinity, a crypto-backed video game.","The vulnerability has to do with the structure of the game itself, which revolves around real money \u2013 non-fungible tokens (NFT) \u2013 rather than your standard in-game currency. It\u2019s what\u2019s known as a \u201Cplay-to-earn\u201D model: Playing the game can actually make you money, if you play your cards right.","This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","Rather than operating directly on the tried and true Ethereum network, Axie Infinity uses a custom-built sidechain called Ronin \u2013 essentially an Ethereum spin-off meant to reduce congestion on the main chain. In order to interact with applications built on Ronin, you\u2019ll need to port your crypto over to the network using a specialized program called a \u201Cbridge.\u201D","This was the site of last month\u2019s exploit. Blockchain networks are notoriously difficult to mess with, in and of themselves \u2013 it\u2019s when you\u2019re moving money between networks that cracks start to form. An attacker managed to steal around $610 million from Poly Network last year by going after the bridge. And just two months ago, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Wormhole had its bridge hacked to the tune of $325 million.","In the case of Axie\/Ronin, the company behind the network didn\u2019t even notice the hack for about a week. Or if it did, it decided to take its time in formally announcing it: A blog post revealing the losses went up on March 29, six full days after the attacker made off with the funds.","\u201CThis is when we show what we're made of,\u201D tweeted Axie co-founder Jeff Zirlin at the time. \u201CChaos is a ladder.\u201D (The apparent \u201DGame of Thrones\u201D reference was not explained.)","This sort of dug-in flippancy has more or less been the mentality of the Axie Infinity team. The Ronin bridge remains down, which means Axie players can\u2019t actually withdraw their crypto from the network, but top brass has apparently decided the show must go on. Sky Mavis, the company responsible for Axie Infinity, has said it plans to reimburse players for their lost funds. It also delayed the game\u2019s next big upgrade, titled \u201CAxie Infinity: Origin,\u201D by a week.","But as Axie looks to retain its status as the single largest play-to-earn ecosystem on any blockchain, security issues may be the least of its worries.","Back in December, Zirlin described Axie Infinity\u2019s play-to-earn mechanics as a kind of liberation for the world of online gaming.","\u201CAll we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve added a system of property rights into games,\u201D he told me, referencing the idea that players can actually \u201Cown\u201D Axie NFTs on the blockchain. \u201CSo, in some ways, we\u2019ve freed people. We\u2019ve given them something that they should have had all along.\u201D","Read More: A Future Where Every Inch of Culture Is Monetized","In practice, though, Axie is a lesson in the dangers of play-to-earn.","While the game can make you money, it can also create debts. Playing the game requires a starting roster of three Axie NFTs, which can only be acquired on the secondary market. Players who can\u2019t afford those initial NFTs (typically costing a couple hundred dollars) turn to Axie \u201Cscholarship\u201D programs, wherein wealthy benefactors front the buy-in in exchange for a cut of the profits.","Call it a gray market system \u2013 it\u2019s not officially sanctioned by Sky Mavis, but in countries like Venezuela and the Philippines, it has become a common mode of interacting with the game. Some popular lenders take as much as two-thirds of the total profits, per the data aggregator CoinGecko.","It\u2019s part of why, according to a report from the research firm Naavik, the majority of Filipino Axie players are still making below the country\u2019s average minimum wage. Stephen Diehl, a prominent crypto critic, likened it to \u201Cdigital serfdom,\u201D though I think that may be slightly misstating it. It\u2019s more like an especially predatory employment contract \u2013 a full-time job with extremely poor returns.","\u201CThe scholar grinds daily, you split the profits,\u201D one scholarship manager told Motherboard. \u201CEverybody wins!\"","This sort of attitude makes the \u201Cserfdom\u201D analog easy to grok. Sky Mavis was valued at $3 billion this past fall, and is backed by the venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. As with any other crypto unicorn, there\u2019s money to be made through speculation. Affiliated tokens AXS and SLP (smooth love potion) can be traded on decentralized exchanges outside of the game and have generated massive market capitalizations.","Meanwhile, the platform\u2019s business model \u2013 which has already been criticized for its resemblance to a Ponzi scheme \u2013 relies heavily on this army of low-wage workers. They create value at the lowest level of the system (the game itself), most of which then flows out of their hands. It reflects an explicit power hierarchy: Those who start with the most money will always end up making the most money.","Read More: The First NFT Monopoly","A socialist might say that\u2019s how many jobs already work. The difference is in the rhetoric: Zirlin claims to have \u201Cfreed\u201D his players when he has essentially recreated an existing, exploitative system on the blockchain.","This was the promise of Uber, too \u2013 the idea that anyone could be a driver, with an increased degree of flexibility. You didn\u2019t need a medallion from the Taxi and Limousine Commission and you could effectively set your own hours. Drivers understood they were employees, but Uber didn\u2019t see it that way; it used a massive ad campaign to persuade California voters to vote \u201Cyes\u201D on a proposition that would exclude in-state gig workers from certain labor laws, and had no trouble getting its way.","As Axie Infinity scrambles to recover from the Ronin bridge hack, it\u2019s putting its other fundamental issues on the back burner. There\u2019s nothing inherently liberatory about the blockchain."],"entity":[{"type":"two months ago","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Axie\/Ronin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Naavik","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March 23","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$325 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zirlin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Axie","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andreessen Horowitz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jeff Zirlin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SLP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Venezuela","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Axie Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$610 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"First NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Limousine Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the Philippines","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stephen Diehl","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$620 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Motherboard","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Poly Network","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mavis","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Axie Infinity","NFTs","Opinion","The Node","Newsletters"],"authors":["Will Gottsegen"]}
