The average PoS staking yield was 10.2%, a 4% decrease from the last quarter.&nbsp;","Overall, the share of PoS compared to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is 22%, a 2% drop quarter-over-quarter.","Staked notes that while the quarter-by-quarter metrics may have been depressed, it bodes well for moving out of the market's rock bottom.&nbsp;","\"Crypto markets drifted lower during the quarter,\" Staked wrote in the report","\"The lack of near term catalysts, regulatory uncertainty and macro challenges left markets in a holding pattern. While crypto assets were down 5-10% on a quarter-by-quarter basis, they were up 10-40% on a year-by-year basis (except stablecoins), indicating that while the bear persists, the market is off the bottom,\" it continued.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
