The Sepolia test network is one of three testnets on which the Shanghai-Capella upgrade, also called Shapella, is being tested. Its deployment is seen as a milestone towards the upgrade's &nbsp;full launch on the mainnet in March.","With today's launch, developers have successfully replicated the main feature of the Shapella upgrade \u2014 which is named&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/eips.ethereum.org\/EIPS\/eip-4895\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014 on Sepolia.
