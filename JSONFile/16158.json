McGuinness she wants the rules to come into force at the latest in spring of next year. The TFR is a parallel law intended to counter money laundering and requires crypto companies to verify the identity of those making transfers.","A European Parliament vote on the legislation, originally scheduled for this month, has been pushed back to February because of concerns about the length and complexity of the text, which must be translated into 24 languages. CoinDesk understands it\u2019s also possible the vote could be held in March, though the legislation was in principle agreed last June. It will take effect 12 to 18 months after being published in the bloc\u2019s official journal.","The two regulations \u201Cset a clear signal to other jurisdictions worldwide,\u201D McGuinness said, with countries such as the U.S. and U.K. contemplating their own crypto laws.","Officials have noted that MiCA would have stemmed alleged improprieties at FTX , because it includes rules against the misuse of customer funds, though some lawmakers appear to be skeptical about that.","Read more: Most Influential 2022: Setting a Standard for Global Regulation of Crypto"],"entity":[{"type":"Nov. 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"European Parliament","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Union Commissioner Mairead McGuinness","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Parliament\u2019s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Standard for Global Regulation of Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Irene Tinagli","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"McGuinness","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Zbyněk Stanjura","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"TFR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Council of Economy and Finance Ministers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"spring","content":"DATE"},{"type":"the U.S.","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","EU","EU Commission","FTX Collapse"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
