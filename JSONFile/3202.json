When asked why, Kyle Samani, managing partner of Multicoin Capital, told The Block: \"One of the most important trends in the world over the last 20 years has been that people spend an increasing percentage of their time online. The Metaverse represents the logical conclusion of that trend.\"","Besides DeFi and NFTs projects, Multicoin said it is also looking to invest in crypto-native distribution platforms for creators, gaming platforms, and Web3 infrastructure projects through its second fund.","\"Over the next few years, there is going to be an incredible wave of innovation in Open Finance and Web3, as well as new kinds of crypto-enabled infrastructure and applications,\" said the firm. \"This wave will only be possible because the underlying infrastructure has matured to a sufficient level. We expect to deploy a significant amount into these areas out of Venture Fund II over the next few years.\"","Multicoin's second fund was closed last November and has already made some investments, Samani told The Block, without sharing project names.","Multicoin's first fund is fully deployed, said Samani, but declined to share its size. That fund invested in more than 30 projects, including Solana, The Graph, Audius, Helium, and Arweave, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/mapping-out-multicoin-capitals-portfolio-2-97906\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as The Block Research reported recently.<\/a>","Multicoin also announced that it has promoted three of its team members \u2014 Matt Shapiro, Mable Jiang, and John Robert Reed \u2014 to partners."],"hashtag":[]}
