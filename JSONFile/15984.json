But such calculations can be tricky, because less than 5% of the total supply is actually in the hands of investors who can trade them.","The much-anticipated airdrop was met with widespread frustration from the Optimism community, as panicked users complained that some claimants were able to claim their tokens ahead of the official airdrop launch.","Optimism officially tweeted about the launch at 5:45 p.m. ET, hours after the smart contract was already deployed and the token began trading on both decentralized and centralized exchanges.","\u201CAt 11am (EST) we deployed and loaded our [smart contract] with the OP tokens for Drop #1,\u201D Optimism tweeted in the wake of the airdrop. \u201COur biggest mistake here was failing to make this contract pausable. Claims were open, and we had no way to stop them.\u201D","Later on, the increased activity on Optimism led to transaction delays, leading to more frustration from the community and further delaying the official airdrop announcement.","\u201CWe significantly underestimated the amount of expected load [deploying our claims user interface] would have on our public RPC endpoint,\u201D Optimism said in a tweet, referring to remote procedure call. \u201CWe quickly moved to massively expand the resources available to serve our public RPC, a process which took several hours of coordination (and waiting) for the amount of load we observed.\u201D","The Optimism team added that there were \u201Ca lot of lessons\u201D learned from the botched airdrop and they would be \u201Cpublishing an extensive retrospective next week.\u201D","According to data from Dune Analytics, just over 43% of eligible wallet addresses had claimed their share of the airdrop as of press time.","In response to the OP token dumping, an Optimism community member, 0xJohn, submitted a governance proposal that would ban sellers of the initial airdrop from receiving future Optimism airdrops.","\u201CThese accounts are not playing a constructive role in Optimism governance,\u201D 0xJohn wrote. \u201CInstead of contributing to governance, they are maximizing for profit.\u201D","Some community members voiced disagreement.","\u201CPeople can do what they want with their airdrops,\u201D Optimism user Mohammedt75 wrote. \u201COnly those actually interested in governance should actually be involved in governance.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dune Analytics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.20","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"43%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"5:45 p.m. ET","content":"TIME"},{"type":"$5.1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"RPC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4.50","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CoinMarketCap","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Optimism","Markets","Trading","Airdrops"],"authors":["Tracy Wang"]}
