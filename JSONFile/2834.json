Both Anderson and the other co-founder, Vance Spencer, were angel investors in Chainlink \u2013 when the project first launched in 2017.

In addition, the firm has locked 20,000 ETH in Edgeware\u2019s lockdrop to help advance the network\u2019s distribution.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Anderson told The Block that Framework Ventures takes a different approach than most venture capital firms and support the networks\u2019 development beyond the simple purchase of coins. According to him, traditionally, venture capitalists would buy and hold these assets, hedge funds would trade the tokens to make a return, and other companies would build applications on top of the protocols.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COur perspective is that the way the best way to proliferate these networks is actually to do all three of those things,\u201D he said. \u201CWe have a venture-style investment thesis in the assets that we back. We help the market add liquidity and help bootstrap a network by providing a validator network. And we will also build things on top of the networks to enhance distribution for the protocols.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Framework Ventures recently helped Futureswap structure their token economics, Anderson said, and is planning on providing liquidity to the network in the low-single-digit millions range once the project launches.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With Common Labs, Framework Ventures is operating some of the first validator nodes on the Edgeware network. The firm is also running for council \u2013 similar to running for a seat on a DAO. In addition, it is helping the Common Labs team think through strategic decisions of what application categories to go after. The firm also has plans to build products and features on top of the Edgeware blockchain.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere's a huge amount of value for someone like Framework to actually step in and help just because as infant blockchains they don't really have everything that you would expect from something like Ethereum or Tezos,\u201D he said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Anderson believes that the DeFi space\u2019s current deficiencies lie in many projects\u2019 lack of sound token economic model and governance model.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CDeFi is something that has a huge opportunity of displacing centralized finance,\u201D he said. \u201CTo do so, you really need to build a token economic model and a governance model that can displace BitMEX, Binance, or major lending platforms.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Looking forward, Anderson said Framework Ventures will focus on projects working on derivatives and lending and borrowing. Stablecoins will also be a category of focus for the firm.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CA stablecoin is perfect for building consumer applications on top of,\u201D he said. \u201COnce you have a distributed stablecoin, that becomes the payment mechanism for things like commerce, games, or content, as opposed to using Eth or Bitcoin payment mechanism.\u201D<\/span>"],"hashtag":[]}
