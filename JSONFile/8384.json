But at the end of the day, they're both digital assets and the goal is to unlock universal ownership in exchange for creators and for communities. NFTs and tokens are just two different ways to unlock value in our digital worlds,\u201D said Scott Gray, head of NFT product at Uniswap Labs.","The marketplace aggregates NFTs up for sale from OpenSea, X2Y2, LooksRare, Sudoswap \u2014 including its pools, which sell NFTs along price curves \u2014 Larva Labs, X2Y2, Foundation and NFT20.","The developer has been working on the product since June when it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/153366\/uniswap-labs-acquires-nft-marketplace-genie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">purchased<\/a> NFT aggregator Genie as part of expansion efforts to include NFTs and ERC-20 tokens among its products.","At the time, it announced plans for an integration with the Uniswap web app and said Genie would remain accessible until the new Uniswap NFT experience was available. For now, the Genie website will redirect to the NFTs on the Uniswap website. The launch comes with some $5 million worth of perks for eligible historical Genie users.","Uniswap\u2019s effort is but the latest NFT aggregator that\u2019s appeared on the scene over the last few months.
