The only other movement in that wallet is a 207 ether ($380,000) inbound transaction that was made only a few minutes earlier. These funds were sent from a different <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x9f9f416a3cfc101dcb332088132ade5c0c90d0a5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wallet<\/a> that hadn't been active since 2017.","It's unclear why this Ethereum ICO participant is consolidating some \u2014 or all \u2014 of their funds into one wallet. They don't appear to have been sent to an exchange and haven't been sold on-chain.","These types of movements have happened a few times in the past.
