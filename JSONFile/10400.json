This type of MEV arises either from the lack of liquidity across different decentralized exchanges or from their front-running each other under certain market conditions.","Uma notes there is one type of MEV related to oracles. In the decentralized finance niche \u2014 and in protocols such as lending or borrowing \u2014 oracles are crucial as they provide external data, like price feeds, to smart contracts. When an oracle update occurs, such as a price feed update, it can create MEV opportunities. For instance, if a lending protocol relies on an oracle for the latest asset prices, there may be a brief window post-update where a trader can leverage this information before the market responds.","This is where oracle extractable value (OEV) comes into play.","\u201CMEV is a major issue for Ethereum, with tens of millions of dollars extracted every year. OEV accounts for a big chunk of that because protocols need price updates,\u201D Uma co-founder Hart Lambur said. \u201COval addresses a real problem by helping protocols capture OEV. It\u2019s been a privilege to work with Flashbots\u2019 best-in-class team to bring Oval to mainnet.\u201D&nbsp;","Oval's goal is to enable protocols, such as lending, to utilize this solution to retain and profit from this value rather than losing it to bots. In this setup, MEV searchers participate in an auction system, bidding for the right to access data from Chainlink oracles related to a certain protocol. The auction proceeds then benefit the protocol.","The roll-out of Oval is a collaborative effort between Uma and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241327\/flashbots-becomes-unicorn-after-completing-60-million-raise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Flashbots<\/a>, one of the leading MEV research and development firms. \u201COval is building on that insight to finally return Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) back to DeFi protocols and their users. We look forward to supporting them on that journey,\u201D said Hasu, Strategy Lead for Flashbots.&nbsp;","Uma began in 2017 as an Ethereum-based DeFi protocol focusing on synthetic assets. Now, it mainly operates a product that enables users to verify data on-chain through economic incentives and dispute resolution. Oval would further add to its existing product stack.","<span data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/273532\/uma-token-sees-90-surge-after-hinting-at-mev-focused-solution\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Uma token<\/a> has seen a 230% surge after it hinted at Oval's release last week, rising from $2 to its current price of over $6.60, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/256967\/uma-uma-usd\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block\u2019s Price Page<\/a>.
