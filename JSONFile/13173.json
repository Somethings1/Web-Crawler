Kelp has over $460 million in user deposits, while Renzo has a TVL of $346 million.","Puffer, the latest addition to the LRT landscape, recently saw <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/277137\/puffer-finance-hits-850-million-in-tvl-now-second-largest-liquid-restaking-protocol\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a rapid increase in deposits<\/a>, reaching the billion-dollar mark shortly after its launch.
