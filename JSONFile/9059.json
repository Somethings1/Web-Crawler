Asked whether American banks would return to Ripple\u2019s ODL product following the ruling, \u201CI think the answer to that is yes,\u201D Alderoty said.","\u201CI think we\u2019re hopeful that this decision would give financial institution customers or potential customers comfort to at least come in and start having the conversation about what problems they are experiencing in their business in terms of moving value across borders without incurring obscene fees,\u201D Alderoty added.","Bank of America was&nbsp;<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/markets\/2019\/10\/17\/blockchain-shy-bank-of-america-quietly-pilots-ripple-technology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/markets\/2019\/10\/17\/blockchain-shy-bank-of-america-quietly-pilots-ripple-technology\/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">piloting<\/a>&nbsp;Ripple\u2019s technology in 2019, though was&nbsp;<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/dailyhodl.com\/2022\/11\/22\/bank-of-america-to-partner-with-ripple-for-odl-services-after-xrp-lawsuit-finishes-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/dailyhodl.com\/2022\/11\/22\/bank-of-america-to-partner-with-ripple-for-odl-services-after-xrp-lawsuit-finishes-report\/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reportedly<\/a>&nbsp;waiting for the case to conclude before any further partnership.

The majority of Ripple\u2019s customers are currently based outside of the U.S.","Last week, Southern District Court of New York Judge Analisa Torres declined to issue a summary judgment requested by both the SEC and Ripple in the enforcement over whether XRP is an unregistered security, with a trial now possible.","The securities regulator accused Ripple of illegally raising $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP in 2020 and also sued CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen. The dispute centered around whether the Ripple-launched XRP token is an unregistered security and whether the sale of it is unlawful.&nbsp;","The SEC's allegations had a detrimental impact on Ripple's business, resulting in the loss of customers and investors. MoneyGram, a major U.S. money transfer company, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/95694\/moneygram-ripple-partnership-suspended-sec-xrp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suspended<\/a> its partnership with Ripple in March 2021 amid the lawsuit.","Torres ruled partially in favor of both sides. She agreed with the SEC's argument that direct institutional investment contracts involving XRP were unlawful securities sales but took Ripple's side on other \"blind bid\" programmatic sales, where Ripple did not know who the buyer was, ruling that those did not break securities laws. The sales brought in $728.9 million and $757 million, respectively.","The crypto industry largely celebrated the partial victory for Ripple, though Alderoty conceded it was not a total win for the firm. Following its partial defeat, the SEC left the door open for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239537\/sec-leaves-door-open-for-appeal-in-ripple-case\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">appeal<\/a> of the decision, which independent experts also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239559\/sec-faces-wake-up-call-after-ripple-ruling-though-appeal-likely\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">expect<\/a>.
