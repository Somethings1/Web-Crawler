In December, Instagram lead Adam Mosseri had <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LibraryNft\/status\/1472205264971608076?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> the team was \u201Cactively exploring NFTs.\u201D","This news also confirms an earlier report by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/2745d50b-36e4-4c0a-abe0-e93f035b0628\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Financial Times<\/a> in January, that Facebook and Instagram might allow users to create and sell NFTs directly on the platforms, and potentially introduce NFT profile pictures.&nbsp;","NFTs could eventually play a role in Meta\u2019s eventual long-term vision of creating a virtual world for its users, Zuckerberg added.","Meta has pitched an ambitious pledge of building out a virtual and augmented reality universe described as the next phase of the internet. The firm has poured significant resources into the effort, but Meta\u2019s Reality Labs, the team working on the metaverse, reported <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/02\/02\/meta-reality-labs-reports-10-billion-loss.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a loss of<\/a> more than $10 billion in 2021.","It's unclear yet how the NFTs will be integrated into Instagram in the near term.&nbsp;","\"I'm not ready to kind of announce exactly what that's going to be today,\u201D said Zuckerberg at SXSW, though he did float several ideas in this vein.","\u201CI would hope that you know, the clothing that your avatar is wearing in the metaverse, you know, can be basically minted as an NFT and you can take it between your different places,\u201D he said. \u201CThere's like, a bunch of technical things that need to get worked out before that'll really be seamless to happen.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
