And once the confidence in luna disappeared and people decided to dump the token, everything crumbled, including the perceived stability and price of UST.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nMany crypto executives are hoping now projects that have better built-in protections will attract more attention from investors.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CThe importance of risk management in Web3 projects has become even more evident. Projects embedded with insurance coverage are poised to gain traction as they offer an additional layer of protection against unforeseen events.,\u201D said managing director of the web3 ecosystem builder Tz Apac, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/katherinenglipei\/?originalSubdomain=sg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Katherine Ng<\/a>. \u201CBy integrating insurance mechanisms, these projects can mitigate potential risks and instill confidence in investors.\u201D","The Terra-luna disaster and its ensuing damage continues to weigh on the minds of both the once-crypto-keen traditional financial institutions who experimented with digital assets during the bull run and the regulatory arena which failed to better oversee the market.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CTrust in cryptocurrency has significantly eroded, which is so ironic since it was intended to be a trustless currency, i.e. it didn\u2019t need to be trusted as there was no central authority,\u201D said Litan. \u201CGartner clients in financial services have mainly all backed down from engaging in public cryptocurrency projects and protocols, for good reason \u2026 they are waiting for clear rules and regulations to start dipping their toes back in. But for now the cryptocurrency industry seems like a pariah to most of them.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe United States is seeking to bring both Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon \u2014 main architect of Terra-luna mess \u2014 and FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried to justice, beneficiaries of a \u201Ccult of personality,\u201D according to Rines. \u201COne of the key lessons learned throughout 2022 is to cautiously evaluate each charismatic influencer who bursts onto the crypto scene,\u201D he said. \u201CEven decentralization-focused crypto-natives can fall prey to the halo effect.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n","","While authorities appear eager to hold Bankman-Fried and Do Kwon accountable, the American regulatory picture \u2014&nbsp; an ineffectual system that failed to protect consumers in those cases \u2014 remains murky. U.S. regulators <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230304\/consensus-building-congress-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">have yet<\/a> to clearly agree on if cryptocurrencies are a security or a commodity while simultaneously sending a message that the future of digital assets could be in jeopardy.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nEurope appears to be clearly ahead of the U.S. in terms of establishing guardrails that could make investing in or using crypto safer. Last month, the European Union officially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227596\/binances-cz-gemini-crypto-sec-eu-mica\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">passed<\/a> its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation which focuses on the centralized points of the crypto industry while providing clarity over the scope and definitions of crypto regulation.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CMany U.S. based crypto firms are moving or considering moving abroad, especially to Europe where regulation is clearer,\u201D said Litan. \u201CThe SEC is cracking down on crypto but \u2026 the agency seems to be going after easy benign targets, many of which have not caused any notable damage to investors.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nNot to be forgotten, aside from the corporate and governmental calamity the many investors and holders of cryptocurrency who lost money have been forced to reckon with some harsh realities.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nPeng said whoever survived the Terra disaster is at least, likely wiser for it. \u201CAnyone who witnessed the entire cycle from Terra\u2019s rise to its downfall and the contagion that followed,\u201D he said. \u201CIf they managed to survive through all that and stay interested in crypto, they definitely learned some really important lessons about how things work and how easy it can be to fool the market into a false sense of security.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CIt\u2019s important to step back and remember that we are still in the early innings of the blockchain movement,\u201D added Levin. \u201CAnd failures of projects are to be expected.
