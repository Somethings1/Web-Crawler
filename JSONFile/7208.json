Such changes redirect the domain to another server and domain name that are configured for malicious activities, such as phishing user accounts.","The Frax team acted quickly to resolve the situation. It engaged with Name.com, the registrar responsible for the aforementioned domains, which confirmed that the domains had been restored to their correct DNS name servers and settings.","Frax Finance <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fraxfinance\/status\/1719589984565641592\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">released<\/a> a public announcement to inform users that the domains were secure and now safe to use, although an investigation into the situation is still underway.","\"Name.com has reached out to us and confirmed the domains are now routed back to their proper DNS under our control. We\u2019ve been told they will let us know what led to the incident after they conduct a full investigation tomorrow,\" the team stated.","Frax Finance added that a comprehensive investigation is due for tomorrow to determine the root cause of the issue.","Recent domain attacks have impacted projects such as the DeFi protocol <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/251970\/balancer-dns-attack-frontend\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Balancer<\/a> and the web3 platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255827\/galxe-announces-396000-refund-to-affected-users-following-dns-attack?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Galxe<\/a>, resulting in user losses.","Â© 2023 The Block.
