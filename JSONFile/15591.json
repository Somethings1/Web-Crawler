The tech-heavy Nasdaq index, whose fluctuations have largely correlated with bitcoin this year, recently fell over 2%. The S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, was down about 1.2%.","Paul McCaffery, co-head of equities for investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, noted the connection between plunging asset prices and Wednesday\u2019s release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) July meeting showing the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to be concerned about inflation and might not slow the pace of interest rate hikes soon. Bitcoin\u2019s price rose last week after an encouraging Consumer Price Index (CPI) suggested the Fed could ratchet back its approach because of easing inflation.","McCaffery said crypto performance will depend on macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing development of regulation.","Read more: Bitcoin Plunges Most in 2 Months, Dashing Recovery Hopes","\u201CThe reality is that for now the space is highly correlated to risk assets, so price action will follow the macro narrative for the most part, with the additional factor of global regulatory action weighing on the sector,\u201D McCaffery wrote in an email.","Sylvia Jablonski, Defiance ETFs co-founder, CEO and chief investment officer, also highlighted voting and non-voting Fed members\u2019 vocal unease with inflation, which remains at near four-decade highs despite the recent improvement shown by the CPI.","\u201CCrypto is now on that list of thoughtful, innovative, disruptive technologies and it's viewed as sort of high risk by the average retail trader,\u201D Jablonski said. \u201CSo what happens is they get this bad news, they sort of take it in and, lo and behold, the price of bitcoin falls.\u201D","Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market value, had risen sharply over the past month on enthusiasm about the expected September Ethereum protocol change known as the Merge.
