You can own your characters, you can own part of the game, you can share in part of the value that you create for the game. We pretty much spend most of our time studying protocols like that and investing in teams that are building into that vision.\u201D","To be sure, Spartan is far from alone. A series of big-name investors have recently raised and deployed capital in this space, including a $100 million fund backed by Alan Howard and the Winklevoss twins.","The latest market entrance represents a shift for Choi, who was not always as focused on digital ownership. As a self-described fundamentalist investor, Choi wasn\u2019t interested in metaverse projects until the fees generated by Axie Infinity caught his eye in late 2020.","\u201CWe were pretty skeptical of the sustainability of the game itself,\u201D Choi said. \"But the numbers were proving us wrong. And from that experience, it kind of taught us that there's clearly a different type of user in this kind of NFT-metaverse gaming vertical versus the DeFi projects that we're very used to.\u201D","Building off its experience with Axie Infinity, Spartan Group\u2019s new fund focuses on three different layers of the metaverse: the infrastructure layer, the experience layer, and the \u2018value add layer,\u2019 the latter of which Choi describes as \u201Cthings that are outside of the metaverse\u201D like guilds and NFT marketplaces.","Since Spartan Group\u2019s new fund is designed to capture the value of a fully developed, populated metaverse, Choi believes it will take \u201Cat least five or ten years to play out.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro and Choi also discuss:<\/em>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fireblocks.com\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/coinbase.com\/prime\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase Prime<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/Chainalysis.com\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.
