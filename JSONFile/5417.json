He pointed to quantitative easing and social discontent as two factors that would lead to such an event.","\u201CIt doesn\u2019t have to be too straightforward, we just have this situation, we have this tinderbox of too much money, no trust and people trying to eke out a living for themselves,\u201D Hayes said. He added that bitcoin would go down too in this scenario.","When asked about the U.S. debt ceiling, Hayes said that it will be resolved following the usual back and forth. But he argued that its timing could cause waves in the market, claiming that financial disruption events typically happen in the fall.","\u201CWith the banking crisis \u2014 and you have the federal government issuing trillions of dollars of debt because they need to fund themselves \u2014 you\u2019re basically putting this powder keg together of a situation that\u2019s going to be exploding in Q3\/Q4 of this year and so why ultimately I think it could be quite good for bitcoin. It will be quite volatile on the upside and the downside,\u201D he said.","As for Hayes\u2019 own investment strategy during this time, he mentioned that Maelstrom was making some plays with respect to ether staking and that it was taking a hard look at the emergence of NFTs on Bitcoin, known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207086\/what-are-bitcoin-nfts-ordinals-and-how-do-they-work\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ordinals<\/a>.","Â© 2023 The Block.
