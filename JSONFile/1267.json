Amun\u2019s inverse ETP, dubbed \u201C21Shares Short Bitcoin ETP (SBTC),\" allows investors to short bitcoin (BTC), Hany Rashwan, co-founder and CEO of Amun, told The Block.","Say for example, if a trader buys $100 of SBTC, a short position of $100 is opened. Assuming that bitcoin's price goes down by 10%, then the SBTC ETP would have a positive return of 10% (minus the costs). SBTC charges an annual management <a href=\"https:\/\/www.six-group.com\/exchanges\/exchange_traded_products\/security_info_en.html?id=CH0514065058USD4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fee<\/a> of 2.5%.","By shorting, SBTC allows traders to \u201Ccapitalize on negative price movements,\u201D said Rashwan. <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Compared to shorting via crypto derivatives, SBTC does not require borrowed capital. <\/span>","Amun said SBTC is reset at the end of each day and the performance is not rolled over to the next day, and therefore, it is \u201Cideally suited to capture short term price movements of bitcoin for a short recommended period.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">11 Crypto ETPs&nbsp;<\/strong>","With SBTC\u2019s addition, Amun now has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/49857\/amun-gets-regulatory-nod-to-offer-crypto-exchange-traded-products-in-eu\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">total of<\/a> 11 crypto ETPs listed on stock exchanges. These ETPs are tied to bitcoin, ether (ETH) and XRP digital assets, among others.","Rashwan told The Block that all the other 10 ETPs are long products, while SBTC is the first short product. \u201CWe are starting with a simple inverse product, but more product types and strategies are coming,\u201D he said.","Such inverse ETPs and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) already exist for traditional assets such as stocks and bonds. For crypto, Rashwan said, SBTC is \u201Cthe world\u2019s first.\u201D","Amun now manages a total of over $55 million in client assets, Rashwan told The Block, adding that the most popular ETPs are HODL, bitcoin ETP and Binance coin (BNB) ETP.","Effective today, Amun is also rebranding all its ETPs under the name 21Shares. \u201CWe wanted to differentiate traditional financial ETPs from our crypto native products,\u201D said Rashwan, adding that 21 refers to bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply of 21 million coins.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nLooking ahead, Amun plans to list its ETPs on at least two European exchanges by end of 2020, said Rashwan.
