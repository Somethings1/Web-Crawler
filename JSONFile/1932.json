Despite the relatively low price and small market value, there have been massive trading volumes,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/chinese-financial-watchdog-warns-of-manipulative-crypto-exchanges\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> NIFA.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nCrypto market manipulation has been a longstanding concern. Last year, Bitwise said roughly 95% of reported trading volume in bitcoin is fake. The Block conducted its own research on the subject at the time and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/up-to-86-of-total-reported-cryptocurrency-trading-volume-is-likely-fake-according-to-analysis-of-exchange-website-visits-24878\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">found<\/a> that about 86% of reported crypto trading volume is likely fake.","NIFA further said that crypto exchanges use \u201Cvarious gimmicks\u201D to gain consumer attention. For instance, some platforms have begun to \u201Chype\u201D the concept of \u201Cvirtual currency is a safe-haven asset beyond gold and silver,\u201D but that\u2019s not true, according to NIFA.","Indeed, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/bitcoin-is-showing-record-correlation-to-equities-60144\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block conducted research<\/a> last week and found that bitcoin, so far in this bear market, has significantly underperformed gold.","Notably, NIFA also said that operating entities of crypto exchanges are \u201Crelatively hidden.\u201D Their office and business development areas are often different, and consumers are unable to determine the identity of these operators, according to the watchdog.&nbsp;","Due to these concerns, the watchdog has advised consumers to not engage in crypto trading activities.","Crypto exchanges are effectively banned in China since 2017, but as long as their servers are outside China and transactions are conducted peer-to-peer (P2P), they can do business in the country.","Binance, for instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/55466\/binances-p2p-trading-platform-adds-support-for-russian-rubles\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">offers<\/a> P2P trading for bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) against the Chinese yuan (CNY) since last October.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
