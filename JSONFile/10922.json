Each NFT sold on MetaMundo therefore includes a bundle of 3D files that make it compatible with multiple metaverses including Decentraland, Cryptovoxels, The Sandbox and Spatial.","MetaMundo said that in the future, new 3D files can be added to the NFT so that it will also be compatible with emerging metaverse environments.","\u201CWe\u2019re solving the lack of NFT interoperability through a unique architecture we\u2019ve developed which features a versatile and extensible NFT metadata structure, supporting multiple 3D file versions and offering the flexibility to add additional file versions later to enable future-proofing as 3D technology evolves,\u201D said MetaMundo co-founder Finn Hansen in a statement.","Hansen, a former product leader at Booking.com, founded MetaMundo last year alongside Mark Studholme, who has a background in working on e-commerce marketplaces. The company\u2019s first funding round was announced in November. It raised $2.7 million led by Animoca Brands.&nbsp;","Interoperability continues to be a top issue for metaverse creators who want to ensure users can transfer assets between worlds. One other attempt to address this has been the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/153299\/tech-giants-opt-into-newly-formed-metaverse-standards-forum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Metaverse Standards Forum<\/a>, which formed last month, albeit without some of the top platforms on their roster.","In its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/157995\/yuga-labs-champions-openness-collaborative-development-in-otherside-litepaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent litepaper<\/a> for metaverse platform Otherside, Yuga Labs also said that it will support interoperability in the future and wants to give users the chance to bring their own outside collections and NFTs into its metaverse.","Â© 2023 The Block.
