But it has backed just one startup in the region \u2014 California-based Polyhedra Network \u2014 so far this year, according to publicly available information tracked by The Block Research\u2019s deals dashboard.&nbsp;","\u201CBinance Labs\u2019 venture capital investment in U.S.-registered crypto projects has been significantly decreasing over the last 12 months with only one investment year-to-date,\u201D said Edvinas Rupkus, a research analyst at The Block Research.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance Labs investments over the last two years. Image: The Block Research<\/span>","Labs\u2019 last accelerator program had just 3 U.S.-based startups involved, down from 7 the previous quarter, according to the data.&nbsp;","The stateside slowdown coincides with regulatory tensions in the U.S. coming to a head. Amid a wider crackdown on the sector, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233154\/sec-files-suit-against-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the SEC sued Binance<\/a> and CEO Changpeng Zhao earlier this week over multiple alleged violations of the country\u2019s securities laws. Binance said it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233186\/binance-says-it-will-defend-our-platform-vigorously-from-sec-lawsuit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">intends to defend its platform<\/a> \u201Cvigorously.\u201D Zhao, or \u201CCZ\u201D as he is widely known, and Binance were also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/223015\/cftc-sues-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sued in March<\/a> by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for allegedly violating federal laws and not registering the exchange in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;","Labs, which oversees the company\u2019s venture and incubation activities, is a behemoth in the crypto venture space.&nbsp;","As of the first quarter this year, it had amassed $9 billion in assets, up from $7.5 billion in August of last year, according to a spokesperson. Its money is invested in over 200 projects from more than 25 countries in six continents. Of those, 50 have been incubated by Labs.","In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/228565\/binance-labs-yibo-ling-investments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an interview<\/a> with The Block in April, Binance\u2019s chief business officer Yibo Ling, who leads investments and M&amp;A for Labs, said the idea driving the venture arm\u2019s activities is that \u201Ca rising tide lifts all boats.\u201D&nbsp;","\u201CWe think that the value of that core business is going to dramatically increase as the web3 ecosystem continues to develop \u2014 so our role is to help seed that ecosystem and help it mature,\u201D he said.&nbsp;","But Labs also has a mandate, through its investments, to bolster activity on BNB Chain \u2014 for which BNB, a cryptocurrency issued by Binance, serves as the native token.&nbsp;","The SEC homed in on BNB in its suit, claiming that from the time of Binance\u2019s ICO in 2017 to the present, \u201CBNB was offered and sold as an investment contract and, therefore, as a security.\u201D","While the watchdog largely left Binance Labs out of the complaint, its role promoting BNB came under scrutiny. The SEC noted that Binance had \u201Cworked to increase demand for BNB by seeking to create additional ways in which BNB can be used \u2014 thereby further increasing demand for the token and its value,\u201D with the creation of Labs\u2019 serving as a prime example.&nbsp;","\u201CBinance Labs has invested more than $500 million in grants to individuals and entities developing applications for Binance blockchains, including BNB-related applications,\u201D the regulator said.&nbsp;","In April, Ling told The Block that regulatory pressure in the U.S. \u201Cdoesn\u2019t really touch Labs in any way.\u201D Yet the evidence increasingly seems to suggest otherwise.&nbsp;","A Binance spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this piece.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
