It will also provide a $250 bonus in bitcoin for spending $3,000 on the card in the first three months. The card comes at an annual fee of $200.","Accumulated rewards will automatically get deposited into users' BlockFi accounts. They will be then able to use it for various purposes, including lending, trading, collateral for borrowing, or even withdrawing to an external wallet.&nbsp;","BlockFi has today opened up a waitlist for existing clients with funded accounts, and will make the waiting list available publicly in January. The firm will then will start shipping cards \"in spring of next year.\" The cards will be issued by Evolve Bank &amp; Trust and powered by Deserve.","The card will be available in \"all 50 U.S. states,\" Prince told The Block. \"We plan to launch in other countries with this card product or something similar over time.\"","While the card initially offers rewards in bitcoin, Prince said the support for other cryptocurrencies could also be added in the future.","Next year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/82683\/coinbase-visa-crypto-debit-card-us-launch-bitcoin-2021\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase<\/a> is also set to launch its Visa card that would offer spending rewards in bitcoin, but that's a debit card. When asked why BlockFi opted for a credit card instead, Prince said, \"credit cards enable higher reward rates to consumers and also come with other benefits, including better purchase protections, greater reward rates, and opportunities for building credit.\"","As for tax implications of bitcoin rewards on the BlockFi credit card, Prince said: \"The cash rewards value is treated as a merchant rebate and as a result not taxable as income. But converting the cash value into bitcoin establishes a cost basis for the bitcoin, which is subject to traditional rules around the taxation of bitcoin holdings.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
