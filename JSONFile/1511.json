Assuming there\u2019s enough liquidity, trading will go live today at 9AM PT.","Shiba inu is a memecoin based on another memecoin \u2014 and one of crypto\u2019s oldest \u2014 named dogecoin. It is also themed around the Shiba Inu breed of dog, with a similarly fanatic community.","In 2013, dogecoin was created as a joke \u2014 despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Shark Tank's Mark Cuban later taking it seriously \u2014 with a much higher supply than bitcoin, soon hitting 100 billion coins. Shiba inu took this one step further, with a current supply of 394 trillion tokens and a max supply of 1 quadrillion tokens.","Both coins have been the target of viral campaigns on TikTok and other platforms, with the idea being to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mcuban\/status\/1368276718860046339\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">get the coins to $1<\/a>. These videos tend to ignore the large token supplies that make this a much more challenging feat, particularly in the case of shiba inu, which would have a market cap of $1 quadrillion were it to achieve that mark. TikTok <a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/no-mo-dogecoin-or-shiba-inu-how-tiktoks-crypto-ban-helps-the-space\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">banned<\/a> crypto promotional videos earlier this year for reasons like this.","The other wild aspect about shiba inu is the way in which half of its supply was distributed. Half of the tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s cryptocurrency address, something that the shiba inu website described as \u201Cburning\u201D the tokens.&nbsp;","Typically, when it comes to burning a token, the token is sent to an address that nobody controls (known as a burn address). In this case, the thought process was that Buterin wouldn\u2019t move or sell the tokens. An assumption that turned out to be mistaken.","On May 12, Buterin elected to sell half of the shiba inu tokens he was given \u2014 along with tokens from other projects that had also sent him half of their supplies \u2014 for a total of $60 million. He then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/104676\/vitalik-buterin-donates-more-than-60m-to-charity-after-selling-meme-tokens-including-shiba-inu\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sent the proceeds<\/a> to charities around the world and contributed to Ethereum-focused grants program Gitcoin, along with some more of the tokens he was given.","Buterin\u2019s sale crashed the shiba inu token\u2019s price, as it fell from a high of $0.000035 to $0.000009 a few days later. The token\u2019s price has since slid slowly downwards, to its current price of $0.000006.","But this hasn\u2019t deterred Coinbase. Having announced plans to list the token on Coinbase Pro on June 15 \u2014 before running into technical difficulties \u2014 the exchange is now trying for the second time. A move that's part of the exchange\u2019s bold plan to list <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/109889\/coinbase-ceo-we-plan-to-list-every-crypto-asset-where-legally-viable\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">every crypto token out there<\/a>.","<i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For more breaking stories like this, make sure to subscribe to The Block on&nbsp;<\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/the_block_crypto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Telegram<\/a><\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/i>","Â© 2023 The Block.
