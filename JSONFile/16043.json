TradeLens now boasts 15 ocean carrier lines, including  ZIM, KMTC, Safmarine, Sealand, Seaboard Marine, Namsung, Boluda and APL.","Todd Scott, vice president of supply chain solution sales at IBM Blockchain, said a lot of work had gone into getting the governance right, ensuring data privacy, publishing APIs, and aligning with common standards, known to the shipping and supply chain industry.","Asked if there had been any other fundamental changes to the ownership of the platform, Scott told CoinDesk: ","In a statement, Martin Gnass, managing director information technology at Hapag-Lloyd, said: \u201CTradeLens has made significant progress in launching a much-needed transformation in the industry, including its partnership model.\u201D","A spokesman for Hapag-Lloyd told CoinDesk via email:","","\u201CConcerning TradeLens, we (like other major carriers) were not happy with the initial governance model proposed by IBM and Maersk. In the meantime, they have changed their approach and made it acceptable for us (and other major carriers like CMA CGM, MSC) to participate in the platform.\u201D","","The spokesman said he could not comment on the details of the new approach as they are \u201Ccommercially confidential\u201D.","Scott offered another theory behind Tradelens\u2019s recent growth spurt.","He said players in the shipping and logistics world may have kicked the tires of other proposed solutions and seen that IBM\u2019s Blockchain Platform (built on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain foundation) offered the best results.","\u201CThere were some other projects that I think that some of the carriers had engaged in that may not have produced the same kind of results [as TradeLens]. So I think that may have played a role as well,\u201D said Scott.","An obvious example of this could be the shipping blockchain pilot run by Accenture, which included Singapore-based shipping carrier APL (American President Lines, 12th largest by cargo volume) and freight forwarding giant Kuehne + Nagel.","APL and its parent company CMA CGM have both now chosen to join TradeLens. (Neither CMA CMG, APL nor Accenture replied to requests for comment by press time.)","Now that IBM\u2019s major supply chain distributed ledgers \u2013 Walmart-backed Food Trust and TradeLens \u2013 are both live and processing a ton of data, when will the effort start pay off with revenues for Big Blue?","\u201CThe expectation is that we will start to turn the corner on this,\u201D Scott said. \u201CWithout getting into specifics and timing, we believe that as the ecosystem sees value, commercialization will come \u2013 certainly in the not too distant future.\u201D ","Shipping port image via Shutterstock"],"entity":[{"type":"Safmarine","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Martin Gnass","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shutterstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Scott","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MSC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"IBM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sealand","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lloyd","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hamburg","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lloyd","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ocean Network Express","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Accenture","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Namsung","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CMA CMG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pacific International Lines","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Maersk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Todd Scott","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CMA CGM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hapag","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"APL (American President Lines","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Boluda","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Walmart","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"IBM Blockchain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"APL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kuehne + Nagel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Seaboard Marine","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Walmart","IBM","News","Supply Chain","Maersk","TradeLens","Hapag-Lloyd","business news"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
