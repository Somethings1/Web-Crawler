Its customers held £93.3 million (~$121 million) worth of crypto assets at the end of 2019, the company revealed in its 2019 annual report published on August 10.","A Revolut spokesperson separately confirmed the numbers to The Block. The 2019 figure is 152% higher than the 2018 number of £37.1 million (~$48 million), meaning Revolut's customers held more crypto assets last year.","It is not clear which cryptocurrencies Revolut's customers held the most, the spokesperson declined to provide details. Revolut <a href=\"https:\/\/www.revolut.com\/legal\/cryptocurrency-terms\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">currently supports<\/a> six cryptocurrencies via its investing app \u2014 Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC) and Stellar Lumens (XLM).","It remains unclear how much Revolut's customers currently hold in crypto assets, the spokesperson declined to provide 2020 figures. But the startup's crypto business appears to have increased, as Revolut noted in the annual report: \"Some products, such as crypto trading, have been positively impacted by COVID-19 in the short term.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">'Intangible assets'<\/strong><\/span>","Revolut recognises customers' crypto assets as \"intangible assets,\" per U.K. accounting standards. \"Cryptocurrencies are recognised at fair value using the revaluation model. Accordingly, an impairment loss on an asset that was not previously remeasured is recognised in profit or loss,\" Revolut said in the annual report.","While Revolut offers customers the ability to purchase cryptocurrencies via its app, the company itself owns cryptocurrencies, as noted in the annual report. \"The cryptocurrencies are held in trust with a qualified custodian, a cryptocurrency wallet provider, or with one of two currency exchanges and can be in either 'hot' (connected to the internet) or 'cold' (not connected to the internet) wallets. Revolut takes the security of the cryptocurrency extremely seriously and has robust systems in place to prevent unauthorised access,\" the company said in the report.&nbsp;","","","Revolut was launched in 2015 and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.revolut.com\/revolut-launches-easiest-fastest-way-to-buy-cryptocurrencies\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">started offering crypto services<\/a> in December 2017, when bitcoin was at an all-time high of $20,000.
