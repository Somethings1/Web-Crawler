The FTSE shed more than 6%, while the DAX in Germany has lost 8%. Euro Stoxx 50 index, an index of Europe's bluechip stocks, was trading down 8.7%.","","","On Sunday, the Federal Reserve announced a series of measures to combat the growing threat of the spreading coronavirus on the global economy, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/a9a28bc0-66fb-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a 100 basis point rate cut<\/a>.

On all counts we think we are not quite there yet.\"","Fiscal stimulus could come.
