They made nine failed transactions before successfully making withdrawals using smaller amounts.","Over the last two weeks, around $1.4 million has been returned to this wallet from various other wallets associated with Alameda. Prior to that, around 11,350 ether ($15.9 million) was sent to it from a wallet associated with crypto exchange Deribit.","The liquidators started consolidating the tokens after <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArkhamIntel\/status\/1608204990581202946?s=20&amp;t=sApd0A4nVXpeGcaIChHQGg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">seemingly losing<\/a> $1.7 million in an attack in December. These tokens were moved to crypto mixing services, presumably in an attempt to launder the funds.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
