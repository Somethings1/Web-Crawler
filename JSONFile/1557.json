While shares have declined 5.4% over the past month, they're up 115% over the past year.&nbsp;","The company has been lobbying lawmakers to create a legal framework that would make operating in the world's largest market for crypto easier. Meanwhile, Coinbase continues to face a legal fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","\"The company\u2019s defense against the lawsuit that the SEC filed against it appears likely to be an overhang on its share price for some time to come,\" Palmer said. He noted that Berenberg had raised its estimate of the company's consumer transaction revenue to $240.8 million from $210 million to reflect &nbsp;\"our expectation that its consumer take rate will contract at a slower pace than we had been anticipating.\"","\"At the same time, we continue to view COIN\u2019s consumer take rate as being at risk of compression due to competition for market share within a lower-volume crypto space,\" he added.&nbsp;","&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["COINBASE"]}
