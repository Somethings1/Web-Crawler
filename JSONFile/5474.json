Under terms of the treaty U.S. authorities are obligated to communicate what they intend to charge in advance.","\u201CAccordingly, in keeping with its treaty obligations to The Bahamas, the government does not intend to proceed to trial on the campaign contributions count,\u201D Williams wrote the federal judge presiding over Bankman-Fried\u2019s criminal proceeding.","Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers previously asked for a dismissal of most charges against him, including the campaign finance charge, over technicalities. Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York, declined to do so, but asked prosecutors to check if the Bahamas government agreed to the campaign finance allegation under terms of its extradition treaty with the U.S.","Prosecutors still plan to move forward with a majority of charges against Bankman-Fried, mainly centered around alleged fraud within FTX and the rest of the former billionaire\u2019s failed crypto empire. If found guilty on all remaining charges the FTX and Alameda Research co-founder still faces possible decades in prison.","Bankman-Fried was one of the most prolific political donors in the U.S. during the 2020 and 2022 election cycles.","Earlier Wednesday Kaplan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241611\/judge-issues-gag-order-on-sam-bankman-fried-as-prosecutors-call-for-jail-time\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">placed a temporary gag order<\/a> on Bankman-Fried and his attorneys, barring them from discussing the case with media until an early August decision over whether the indicted crypto mogul will spend the rest of his time before an October criminal trial in jail due to possible violations of his bail terms.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
