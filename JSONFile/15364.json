Optimists see it as a watershed moment of validation for blockchain and smart contracts from a very serious fintech player.","This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond.

Instead, the more immediate motive may be quite simple:","PayPal wants to collect the interest on your dollars.","See, PYUSD, like other reputable dollar stablecoins, will be \u201Cbacked\u201D by a collection of dollar bank deposits and highly liquid dollar equivalents held in a trust managed by Paxos Trust. Short-dated U.S. Treasuries, which are likely to make up the bulk of PYUSD\u2019s backing, are now offering a whopping 5% yield. PayPal gets to keep that yield.","That puts a different spin on comments this week from Jose Fernandez da Ponte, head of PayPal\u2019s crypto efforts. Da Ponte told CNBC Crypto that \u201Cwe think of PYUSD as an extension of the PayPal balance \u2026 making it available outside of the PayPal ecosystem.\u201D","See also: PayPal's New Stablecoin and the '2 Wolves' Inside Crypto | Opinion","A PayPal balance is the money a customer leaves on the platform \u2014 or now with PYUSD, money they leave with PayPal in exchange for PYUSD. Users, for the record, should absolutely not do this at scale, partly because your money is at risk of seizure (and can be seized in stablecoin form). More importantly, you shouldn\u2019t leave a PayPal balance because PayPal doesn't pay any interest. That's why your money became PayPal\u2019s revenue opportunity as soon as underlying interest rates started going up.","PayPal doesn\u2019t make the numbers entirely clear. In its quarterly reports, the company reports interest revenue on customer deposits to Wall Street as part of a larger category it calls \u201CRevenues from other Value Added Services.\u201D That includes \u201Cinterest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances,\u201D but also a plethora of other revenue sources, including \u201Creferral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees and other services.\u201D So that category is not a clear index of how much \u201Cfloat\u201D PayPal is getting from its users.","What we do know is that \u201Cvalue added\u201D revenue is going up much, much faster than transaction fee revenue: It rose 37% between the second quarter of 2022 and the same period in 2023, while transaction revenue rose a measly 4.5%. It seems very likely that rising interest on customer deposits was a major driver of that divergence.","These changing conditions would make a stablecoin vastly more appealing for PayPal, for two straightforward reasons. First, as Da Ponte implied, the extended services enabled by a stablecoin may encourage users to hold a larger amount of money in the form of PYUSD, and to hold it longer. In theory, that could happen if there are simply more ways to use PYUSD than a conventional PayPal balance \u2014 for instance, for crypto trading on decentralized-finance platforms. Those larger overall collateral balances would produce more interest for PayPal on the back end.","(PYUSD will initially be available to U.S. users who have purchased crypto on PayPal before, but given the global nature of blockchain will likely be available worldwide in time.)","But far more to the point, a stablecoin could be spent without the underlying balance *ever* having to leave PayPal\u2019s coffers. A rent payment from a PayPal deposit currently has to be turned into real dollars to be sent to a landlord\u2019s bank account, for instance. But the same landlord (or eBay seller, or what have you) might eventually be more willing to accept payment in PYUSD, and then use those tokens in turn to pay contractors or other service providers.","See also: PayPal\u2019s Regulated Stablecoin Is \u2018Watershed Moment\u2019 in Crypto","This would mean a smaller proportion of PYUSD users would \u201Ccash out\u201D to actual dollars at any given point, leaving PayPal a higher proportion of Treasury or other interest as revenue. Its status as a publicly tracked blockchain token might even feed this dynamic, if enough users found that transparency more trustworthy than a simple number displayed on a web portal. Assuming we\u2019re entering a period where interest rates will be higher for longer than over the preceding decade, this could accelerate the shift of PayPal\u2019s revenue mix toward deposit interest earnings.","Although the stablecoin field is somewhat crowded, if PYUSD catches on, it could be at least as important to PayPal\u2019s corporate strategy as it is to the crypto sector.","Edited by Daniel Kuhn."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CNBC Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"PYUSD","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Daniel Kuhn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Paxos Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"PayPal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"second quarter of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Value Added Services","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$64 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Da Ponte","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"37%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jose Fernandez da Ponte","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","PayPal","Interest Rates","Stablecoin","Pyusd","The Node","Newsletters"],"authors":["David Z.
