This term is named in analogy to the ERC-20 token standard on the Ethereum blockchain, although their mechanisms differ.","Introduced by developer Casey Rodarmor in early 2023, the Ordinals protocol allows developers to assign a distinct identity or file onto every satoshi within the Bitcoin network, a process called inscription. This mechanism set the stage for the development of both fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like BRC-20 tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which frequently showcase digital art.","While the Ordinals core team devised a method for generating NFTs on Bitcoin, another pseudonymous developer named Domo introduced an experimental token standard built upon the Ordinals protocol called BRC-20 in March. This enabled users to issue fungible tokens like ordi and others with the help of incsribing specific files to satoshis.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
