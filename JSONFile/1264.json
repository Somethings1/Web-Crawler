Panoptic and Greenfield did not disclose a valuation for the round.","The funding will help Panoptic further develop the platform during its current beta testing phase, ahead of an Ethereum mainnet launch and V2 product. \u201CThe estimated launch dates for our protocol are Q1, 2024 for mainnet and Q4, 2025 for V2,\u201D Panoptic COO Jesper Kristensen told The Block.","The seed funding brings Panoptic\u2019s total raise to $11.5 million, following a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/192207\/uniswap-based-defi-protocol-panoptic-raises-4-5-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$4.5 million<\/a> seed funding round in December 2022 led by gCC, with Uniswap Labs Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Jane Street, Avalanche Foundation's Blizzard fund and others participating.&nbsp;","Panoptic's perpetual options fill a significant gap in the DeFi market, Panoptic co-founder and CEO Guillaume Lambert said in a statement. \u201CWith the backing of top VCs, our commitment to groundbreaking innovation has never been stronger. We envision a future where finance is truly democratized.\u201D","Panoptic plans to bring its so-called \u201Cpanoptions\u201D perpetual options to the DeFi market. Perpetual options are a financial derivative similar to perpetual futures, providing the same functionality as trading traditional options but without an expiry date, offering continuous rollover every 12 seconds.","Built on top of one of the world\u2019s largest decentralized exchanges, Uniswap v3, the Panoptic platform allows users to trade perpetual options between any two Ethereum ERC-20 tokens, introducing more advanced and flexible DeFi trading strategies, including hedging and income generation.","Panoptic said the options market was \u201Cvastly underserved\u201D compared to a traditional finance options market that typically sees more daily activity than the spot market. The latest figures from DefiLlama appear to agree, with <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/options\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$4.59 million<\/a> in daily DeFi options volume representing just 0.2% of DeFi\u2019s daily <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/dexs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$2.5 billion<\/a> DEX volume.","\u201CPanoptic\u2019s goal is not to replicate traditional options on-chain but to innovate within the building blocks of DeFi and thereby help options gain significant traction,\u201D Gleb Dudka, Principal at Greenfield Capital said. \u201CWe believe that the team behind Panoptic is well-positioned for that, as they are thought leaders in the field of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and have built an outstanding platform. It simplifies options trading strategies and has an excellent UX and UI in place, which enables any user the creation of sophisticated trading strategies with a simple click of a button.\"","Panoptic was established in July 2022 by Kristensen, a former head of research at Advanced Blockchain AG, and Lambert, a professor of applied physics at Cornell University."],"hashtag":["DERIVATIVES","DEXS","SEED &AMP; PRE-SEED","UNISWAP"]}
