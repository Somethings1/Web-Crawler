Backed by our expertise and partnerships within the digital asset ecosystem, Openverse is at the forefront of onboarding businesses and communities into the metaverse, unlocking the true potential of decentralisation,\u201D said Amber Group's Chief Executive Officer, Michael Wu.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Openverse is designed to be a Web3 enablement platform, supported by <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">leading real-time 3D rendering technology to create an experiential digital world for all users<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.

As we develop a gateway for everyone to journey into the metaverse together, we are also building a strong line-up of partnerships with gaming studios, sporting brands, digital artists and creators in an effort to bridge the gap between physical and virtual economies. Not only will this encourage more Web2 users to migrate into the metaverse, it will also herald a new era for digital assets worldwide,\u201D said Openverse\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Jo Xu.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">-END-&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Media Contact<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stella Wang<\/span>","<a href=\"\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection#2f5f5d6f4e424d4a5d485d405a5f014640\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"42323002232f20273025302d37326c2b2d\">[email&nbsp;protected]<\/span><\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About Amber Group<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Amber Group is a leading digital asset platform operating globally with offices in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.
