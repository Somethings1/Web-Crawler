While concern was palpable everywhere, speakers and attendees alike worked to find a silver lining in all the madness.","At the shiny new Solana Embassy in Miami\u2019s Wynwood arts and entertainment district, amid bright neon lights, tropical plants, and displays paying homage to various NFT projects and DAOs, QuickNode co-founder Auston Bunsen assembled a crowd that included Blockchain.com CEO Peter Smith and Steven Goldfeder, the co-founder and CEO of layer 2 network Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs. Not surprisingly, FTX was on everybody's mind.&nbsp;","Blockchain.com\u2019s Smith said he didn\u2019t see any immediate winners in the aftermath of the collapse, but he tried to place the event in context, noting that it wasn\u2019t the first exchange to fail.","\u201CHaving a big exchange blow up, that\u2019s literally happened every down market we\u2019ve ever been through, and usually it\u2019s the number one exchange that blows up,\u201D he said. \u201CAt the moment, your only job as a crypto CEO, running a larger company, is to make sure that you survive. It\u2019s a survival of the fittest. We\u2019re sort of all playing the Hunger Games of crypto right now.\u201D","VC funders told developers that it was time to get back to basics and away from some of the excess that have characterized the past two years.","In a panel titled \u201CFunding your web3 startup: What\u2019s HOT, what\u2019s NOT?\" investors Marell Evans of Exceptional Capital, Jared Franklin of Costanoa Ventures and Bruno Faviero of Magna all agreed that it\u2019s going to be a lot harder to raise cash post-FTX, at least in the near future.","\u201CThe top teams will continue to get funded,\u201D Costanoa\u2019s Franklin said, adding that he saw opportunities in security, insurance, and even the now-maligned centralized finance sector as other companies step up to fill in the gap left by FTX. \u201CBut there\u2019s no doubt that this will have an impact and a chilling effect for probably a couple of years\u2026 The quality deals will still continue to get done. They\u2019ll even be competitive. But a lot that\u2019s not just won\u2019t. And I think it\u2019s relatively healthy. What\u2019s unhealthy and unfortunate is the sentiment and the slower adoption that will take place, and the scrutiny.\u201D","He said that layoffs at larger companies could spark a wave of innovation, as it will be less risky for people to go and start a company than to join a downsizing tech company. Arbitrum\u2019s Goldfeder said he was hiring.","FTX\u2019s close links to Miami were not lost on anyone, and it\u2019s an opened-ended question as to how much of an impact the rapid demise of the exchange could have on the momentum. Blockchain.com moved its U.S. headquarters to Miami last year in what was a pandemic-fueled, hot crypto summer that saw a flurry of activity as the city sought to position itself as a global leader in the sector.","\u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a city selling an arena sponsorship or you\u2019re a banking partner or you\u2019re a VC investor, the net result of the FTX episode is going to be an increased focus on corporate governance, access controls and due diligence, and I think that\u2019s going to be a net positive for the whole space,\u201D Smith said. \u201CI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to impact Miami in a particular way that it doesn\u2019t impact any other city or any place. The bar for diligence and the bar for making sure that crypto companies have good governance is going to come back in fashion.\"","While Smith said he didn\u2019t believe that there was a single crypto city, he said he loved the energy in Miami. He noted that the majority of the company\u2019s engineering team was in the European time zone and Singapore.","\u201CThere\u2019s a certain optimism about Miami that\u2019s very unique, where people have this bias toward believing that the best days of Miami are in its future, rather than in its past,\u201D he said, noting that crypto is spread out, decentralized and lives on the internet. \u201CBut the passion for crypto is probably uniquely high here in Miami, and that\u2019s a really cool thing to be a part of.\"","Across town at a separate conference hosted by TechCrunch, Devin Finzer, the CEO of NFT marketplace giant OpenSea, said he was thinking about education on the regulatory front.","\u201CThe challenge, and something we\u2019re investing a ton in, is really ensuring that that message gets conveyed to government regulators and ensure that there\u2019s not sort of one size fits all solutions applied to a technology that\u2019s fundamentally very, very diverse in nature,\u201D he said. \u201CTreating NFTs as securities would be a blanket solution that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201D","Pratima Arora, Chief Product Officer at Chainalysis, said it was \u201Ctime to build\u201D and still too early to know the full impact the collapse of FTX will have on the industry.","\u201CIt will take time to build back trust,\u201D she said in an interview, stating that she didn\u2019t think there is a fundamental issue with blockchain technology itself. \u201CThis could have happened in any industry, and in the past, we\u2019ve seen it happen in a lot of industries. So it\u2019s not new, but it pushes us to the next phase of maturity, and we need to hold ourselves to higher standards.\u201D","Back at the Solana Embassy at QuickNode\u2019s \u201C#Nodevember\u201D conference, there was some fear that regulators might misstep with a hasty, knee-jerk reaction, while other\u2019s pondered which might be the next company to take a hit. Goose Wayne, a core contributor at the GooseFX super app on Solana, said he\u2019s heard that many market makers have stopped activities on some centralized exchanges as they wait to see how the dust settles, who has the reserves and who doesn\u2019t.","\u201CI think instead of a prolonged pessimism, where everyone is waiting to see when the next big drop is going to be, FTX accelerated the fall of all the dominoes that were on their edge in this ecosystem,\u201D Magna\u2019s Faviero said in an interview. \u201CEverything that was going to crash or come down is going to come down, and then it\u2019s just going to be the dust settling and only optimism from there. Then it\u2019s only building and going up because all the damage will have been done.\u201D","The event was not without humor. Hidden in the back room at the Solana Embassy were t-shirts bearing a palm tree-adorned FTX Miami logo that those in the know eagerly collected. And in the final session, nervous laughter erupted with a closing question from an audience member: \u201CIf you launch a token, how do you avoid getting into trouble?\u201D","","Â© 2023 The Block.
