OSKTO is a \u201Cdigitally enhanced security\u201D that trades on affiliate tZERO\u2019s blockchain-backed platform \u2013 the only trading system that can support it.","","","If the distribution goes without a hitch, it may validate a corporate gambit whose creator, former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, considered revolutionary. Byrne thought the blockchain dividend could drive growth for tZERO\u2019s blockchain trading system and simultaneously \u201Cexpose the slop\u201D he said was inherent to Wall Street\u2019s capital markets. ","","","Byrne resigned less than a month after his proposal\u2019s July 2019 reveal. Overstock\u2019s new leadership continued to push for blockchain dividends, calling it \u201Cof great importance to the Company\u2019s blockchain strategy,\u201D in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory filings. ","","","\u201CIn particular, we believe the successful issuance of the Dividend will demonstrate to other issuers and market participants that this technology is scalable and has significant benefits to all market participants,\u201D CEO Jonathan Johnson and chairwoman of the board Allison H. Abraham wrote in the undated filing from Overstock\u2019s investor site.","","","Overstock\u2019s May 19 dividend issuance will be more a theoretical demonstration than technological vindication, however. As described in the Tuesday filing, OSTKO is a \u201Cdigitally enhanced security,\u201D not a full digital asset.","","","That\u2019s because OSTKO\u2019s on-chain representation is a legally irrelevant \u201Ccourtesy carbon copy\u201D of the security\u2019s real ownership records held on transfer agent Computershare\u2019s \u201Cconventional records,\u201D which update before the distributed ledger does.","","","Johnson told CoinDesk on Tuesday the technological concession helps the asset \u201Cfit within regulatory parameters\u201D (OSTKO is being registered with the SEC). It\u2019s essentially a bridge.","","","\u201CThe goal is that as regulators and market participants become increasingly comfortable with DLT\/blockchain technology, it will gradually play a larger role in the overall process to the benefit of investors, regulators and other market participants,\u201D he said.",""],"entity":[{"type":"July 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Patrick Byrne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jonathan Johnson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DLT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Computershare","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 27","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Overstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Allison H.
