User growth continues as there are almost 3.4 million total ADA wallets and around 2,000 new wallets created daily. With 1.2 million wallets delegating their ADA tokens across 3,000 stake pool operators, Cardano has become one of the biggest decentralized Proof-of-Stake blockchains. Unfortunately, this growth has come with its drawbacks. Giveaway scams, rugpulls, and other malicious activity that has plagued other blockchains like Ethereum have made their way to Cardano, eroding trust and destroying the value of individual\u2019s crypto holdings.&nbsp; <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">How do you avoid projects that lack value to focus on dApps that will add utility to the growing Cardano ecosystem?<\/b>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Genius X staking program: Receive access to the best&nbsp;projects on Cardano<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3yIvG4H\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Genius X staking program<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and its utility token <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@GeniusXOfficial\/genius-x-announces-the-gensx-utility-token-and-a-tiered-staking-program-9245bc8e6aa5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">GENSX <\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">is your key that unlocks access to the best Cardano projects. <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The primary advantage of staking your GENSX tokens is receiving 20% of fees earned by the Genius X accelerator program, which could include GENSX tokens and the project\u2019s native tokens.&nbsp; <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Rb01ju\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rewards<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> will be distributed from the Genius X DAO Treasury.&nbsp; For example, if Genius X earns 5% of the client\u2019s token total supply, the Genius X staking program will receive 20% of the amount, or 1% of the client\u2019s token total supply. <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Have a look at some projects you can access by participating in the Genius X staking program:<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The listed projects are just a sample of startups in the Genius X accelerator program.&nbsp; More information will be published about other startups being onboarded.
