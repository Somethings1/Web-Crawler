Block revealed its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/block-bitcoin-hardware-wallet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin hardware wallet<\/a> this past spring.&nbsp;","Formerly known as Square, Block has made a huge bet on Bitcoin and decentralized finance.","For instance, Block's decentralized finance unit, TBD, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174714\/how-circles-new-partnership-with-tbd-is-connecting-crypto-to-the-real-world\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> earlier this month a stablecoin partnership with Circle.","As for mining, Block\u2019s general manager for hardware, Thomas Templeton, outlined the company's Bitcoin mining ambitions in January, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/01\/13\/block-formerly-square-is-building-a-system-for-bitcoin-miners.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> by CNBC.","\u201CCommon issues we\u2019ve heard with current systems are around heat dissipation and dust. They also become non-functional almost every day, which requires a time-consuming reboot. We want to build something that just works,\u201D Templeton said on Twitter. \u201CThey\u2019re also very noisy, which makes them too loud for home use.\u201D","Block is making a push into mining during a period that\u2019s difficult for the sector. Companies have seen their profit margins squeezed in the past few months, as bitcoin\u2019s value dropped and energy prices went up, along with global hash rate and mining difficulty.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Catarina Moura contributed reporting.&nbsp;<\/em>","© 2023 The Block.
