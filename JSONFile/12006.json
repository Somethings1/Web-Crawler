Block Finance lead Amrita Ahuja said the firm sees a $3 billion gross profit opportunity for bitcoin consumer trading.","\u201CWe think we've just scratched the surface for further adoption of Bitcoin in the United States and globally,\u201D said Ahuja. \u201CWe believe Bitcoin is going to have a profound impact on financial services, particularly as a tool for economic empowerment and as a global currency for the Internet.\u201D","This approach means capturing value across a number of sectors within crypto. That, of course, includes Block\u2019s wheelhouse, payments, but it has also expanded to building hardware and platforms for crypto users to capture value in the crypto ecosystem.","Indeed, the firm is building its own wallet, which will integrate hardware and software to enable self-custody, a decentralized exchange dubbed \u201CTBDex\u201D and a decentralized mining system.","\u201CThese initiatives are early in their development and we intend to build out in the open,\u201D said Ahuja.","Dorsey <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/130439\/jack-dorseys-block-commits-to-build-an-open-bitcoin-mining-ecosystem\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">committed<\/a> to building an \u201Copen\u201D bitcoin mining system at the start of this year. Block contends that the current state of mining is dominated by large firms and hard to access for small firms or individuals.","\u201CWe want to dramatically expand access to this rapidly growing market, which would add resilience and security to the Bitcoin ecosystem and generate value for a broader set of stakeholders,\u201D said Ahuja. \u201CThis is what our mining initiative intends to fulfill.\u201D","Its TBD project was kept under wraps until Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/124945\/square-decentralized-exchange-protocol-white-paper\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">circulated<\/a> a white paper on the project\u2019s design in November of last year. That document proposed the \u201CtbDEX\u201D would facilitate \"decentralized networks of exchange between assets by providing a framework for establishing social trust, utilizing decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to establish the provenance of identity in the real world.\u201D","At today\u2019s events, Ahuja said Building a new system for managing identity and trust in a decentralized manner is at the core of the product\u2019s development.","\u201COur plan is to build consumer-facing proprietary products and also enable developers and other industry participants to build upon our standards,\u201D she said.","The hope is to enable cheaper remittances for consumers through services built on TBD, while also enabling developers to build products geared towards decentralized financial services. As of now, Ahuja said Block is already actively engaging potential partners in the financial services space, and said the firm is \u201Cencouraged about the interest they\u2019re showing.\u201D","Today's event is Block's first Investor Day since 2017.","Â© 2023 The Block.
