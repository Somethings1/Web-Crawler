He believes that it is necessary to first define the pros and cons of a CBDC. \u201CThen it can be decided whether it is needed and the risks can be controlled,\u201D he said in the interview.","ECB President Christine Lagarde, however, recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/50397\/european-central-bank-hopes-to-get-ahead-of-the-curve-on-stablecoins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> that the central bank should get \"ahead of the curve\" on stablecoins. The ECB also plans to establish clear objectives for its digital currency task force by mid-2020, Lagarde said at the time.","China and Sweden are also set to launch their national digital currencies soon. Weidmann, however, is not keen on the idea of digital currency. He told Handelsblatt that China \"may be faster, but it also has a different political system,\u201D adding: \u201CThe state has a wealth of power there that many of us would not like. I believe that a social market economy will ultimately find better solutions in a free society.\u201D","Yet, Germany\u2019s central bank is itself experimenting with a digital currency. To that, Weidmann said, it is about payment transactions between the central bank and commercial banks. Specifically, the central bank is testing blockchain tech to supplement its central, account-based solution, however, that has also not yielded any better results, according to Weidmann.","\u201CIn our special context with a few business partners we know, blockchain is initially no more efficient than central processing,\u201D he said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
