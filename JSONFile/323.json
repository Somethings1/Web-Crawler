Risc Zero says that proofs for Ethereum blocks can be generated in just minutes and verified on-chain using Zeth.","\u201COur technology allowed Zeth to be built at a tiny fraction of the cost of similar efforts; RISC Zero\u2019s zkVM can be used by any team to build innovative new offerings in record time,\u201D said Brian Retford, CEO and co-founder.","Risc Zero raised a $40 million Series A round in July that was led by Blockchain Capital.","In a a ZK-rollup system, a prover is a component responsible for creating a proof of computation. This proof is then verified by the main blockchain (Layer 1) or other validators. The aim is to offload computational work from the main blockchain, thus enhancing scalability for apps.","The release comes at a time when the field of ZK-rollups is seeing a major uptick and interest from various research teams. The crypto unit at Andreessen Horowitz, a16z crypto, recently introduced a zero knowledge-based prover named <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244116\/a16z-crypto-zero-knowledge-proofs-lasso-jolt\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lasso<\/a>.","Furthermore, crypto teams associated with projects such as Polygon and Matter Labs are working on their own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239880\/zksync-launches-new-proof-system-called-boojum-for-era-mainnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">provers<\/a>, all aiming to enhance ZK-rollup solutions.","Â© 2023 The Block.
