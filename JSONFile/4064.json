Eqonex had been in negotiations with potential investors to obtain equity financing through the issuance of new shares, and had also been negotiating with Bifinity to extend a loan provision. ''Unfortunately, despite the group\u2019s best efforts, these negotiations have not been successful,'' the firm said.&nbsp;","Eqonex's Hong Kong units, Diginex Ltd. and Eqonex Capital Pte. Ltd., are in the process of being placed into voluntary liquidation.","The group's Digivault Ltd. and Bletchley Park Asset Management were not involved in the insolvency proceedings.
