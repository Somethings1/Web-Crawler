Moreover, the messages are encrypted with security keys exclusively shared between the conversation participants, adding an extra layer of security.","Coinbase stated that the update will also let users send payments to others using the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/228407\/circle-protocol-stablecoin-transfers-ethereum-avalanche\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">USD Coin<\/a>&nbsp;without incurring any gas fees, all within the messaging interface. This integration simplifies the transaction process, removing the usual complications associated with address input, and merges the convenience of messaging with the functionality of payments, the exchange noted.","Coinbase Wallet will be the first and only self-custodial wallet to feature integrated messaging on XMTP, providing users with ownership of their cryptocurrency, identity, and communications. The messaging feature will go live today and be accessible to users receiving an invitational QR code from the company.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
