Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York ordered a trial by jury for Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen over whether they are liable in illegal securities sales to institutional investors who bought hundreds of millions of dollars worth of XRP.&nbsp;","But the crypto industry at large celebrated the partial win for Ripple, framing it as a development that showed cracks in the SEC's armor. The agency has an undefeated track record in enforcement cases brought against crypto firms dating back to the initial coin offering bubble of 2017.&nbsp;","<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Looking forward to getting a refund on my Acela tickets now that I no longer need to come in and talk to the <\/span><span class=\"r-18u37iz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a class=\"css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" dir=\"ltr\" role=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SECGov\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@SECGov<\/a><\/span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.

Torres seemed to indicate that purchases of XRP in transactions where the buyer either didn't know that Ripple was the seller, as in the programmatic sales, or on the secondary market would not qualify as de facto investments in the company, which would qualify as illicit securities sales.","\"Therefore, the vast majority of individuals who purchased XRP from digital asset exchanges did not invest money in Ripple at all,\" Torres wrote.","She contrasted this with Ripple's sales to institutional buyers, who did know who they bought XRP from, and could reasonably expect to earn a profit from investing in a common enterprise, a hallmark of securities law.&nbsp;","Still, it's not clear whether Torres intended her ruling on blind bid sales to be a broad green light for secondary market sales. In her ruling, the judge wrote that the \"totality of circumstances\" around the transaction would determine whether a secondary sale is an illegal securities offering or not.","Though ruling did not take the company and its lead executives off the hook for potential enforcement repercussions, legal experts saw the programmatic buyer part of Torres's ruling as a win for both Ripple and the broader crypto industry.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe logical conclusion is that secondary sales of XRP are not securities transactions,\u201D said Stephen Palley, partner and co-chair of the digital commerce group at the law firm Brown Rudnick.<\/span>","That could have major implications for the secondary market for digital assets, where most crypto transactions take place. It <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">could also bolster industry arguments in other proceedings, like the SEC's case against Coinbase over several of the digital assets the company listed for public trading. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis is a major victory for the industry and a major loss for the SEC because in fact by holding that the programmatic sales are not investment contracts, she is holding that secondary market transactions in crypto assets are not securities,\u201D said Gary DeWaal, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">senior counsel at law firm Katten.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Teresa Goody Guillén, a partner at law firm BakerHostetler, agreed.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSo far digital asset issuers have not battled in court this far and obtained a ruling that in some circumstances the transaction involving a digital asset is not a security and so I think you\u2019ll see implications for this in the Coinbase and Binance cases,\u201D she said.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe blind bid seemed to be a big part of her reasoning here that if the buyer and the seller don\u2019t know who each other are then, in these circumstances, there wasn\u2019t an investment contract.\u201D <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the order though is not binding and even judges within the same district court could disagree, Goody <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Guillén added. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The judge\u2019s ruling, too, can still be appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which multiple experts predict will happen, possibly before a trial to determine whether Garlinghouse and Larsen might be liable in civil court for unlawful securities sales.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI suspect that both the SEC and Ripple are looking at their options there,\u201D said Palley.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf I\u2019m Ripple I\u2019m looking at the ruling on institutional sales and thinking maybe I want to take that up too.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","In a note analyzing the ruling, TD Cowen Managing Director Jaret Seiberg called the ruling a \"wake-up call to the SEC that its legal authority may not be as clear as it believed.\"&nbsp;","But he also noted that \"appeals courts often overrule trial court judges\" and that experts at the investment bank \"do not see it as a given that the appeals court will uphold the district court's decision or reasoning.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n","© 2023 The Block.
