With the \"Secure Asset Transfer Network,\" the process of transferring assets is faster and more efficient, Fireblocks told The Block.","The firm explained that before creating this network, if two counterparties were both using Fireblocks, they would need to add Fireblocks wallets manually. Now, they can search for a counterparty on the network and send a connection request. This approach, in turn, helps to settle with a counterparty more efficiently and reduces manual processes from \"hours or days\" to \"just a few seconds,\" the company argues.","\"With more institutional players joining the digital assets ecosystem, the Fireblocks Network serves as an essential layer to streamline the operations and eliminate the biggest risk in moving and settling digital value, and created the most adopted rails for executing blockchain transactions in a way that even non-technical users can use quickly and securely,\" Michael Shaulov, CEO of Fireblocks, told The Block.","More than 55 institutions and crypto 26 exchanges are already active on the network, said Fireblocks. Members include Binance, Coinbase Pro, Gemini, Kraken, FTX, B2C2, Galaxy Digital and Genesis Trading.","Fireblocks claims to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/67146\/fidelity-backed-crypto-security-startup-fireblocks-launches-secure-asset-transfer-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">assisted<\/a> in transferring over $30 billion worth of digital assets to date via its platform.
