Previously, standard Revolut users could trade just $200 a month before incurring fees.","Other changes allow users to withdraw a certain amount of money a month, send up to 10 international remittances a month and set up five accounts for their children free of charge.","Ron Oliveira, CEO of Revolut in the U.S., told The Block that the move is about boosting awareness of the company locally. Revolut launched in the U.S. in March 2020, just as the Covid-19 pandemic struck. The unfortunate timing hampered its early marketing efforts, according to Oliveira.","\u201CWe had a very quiet opening,\u201D he said. \u201CNow it\u2019s about where are we going from here. What we\u2019ve discovered is that we have the deepest and widest offering of any fintech in the United States today.\u201D","Launched in London in 2015, Revolut began as a foreign exchange tool. It now fashions itself as a financial \u201Csuper-app,\u201D offering current accounts, stock and crypto trading, and a range of other products. CNBC recently revealed that the startup plans to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/09\/21\/revolut-the-33-billion-fintech-player-is-rolling-out-commission-free-stock-trading-in-the-us-.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">roll out stock trading<\/a> for U.S. customers in the coming months.","Revolut is also pursuing a banking charter in the U.S., as it plans to in many of the markets in which it operates. The startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/22\/revolut-applies-for-bank-charter-in-the-us\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">submitted a draft application<\/a> with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation in March.","\u201CPart of our strategic plan globally is that we want to have banking licenses either in countries where we already have a large presence, or where we think the upside is great, and the U.S. is of course the latter,\u201D said Oliveira, adding that a charter would give Revolut the ability to offer a much wider range of products. The firm is already looking to roll out credit cards and unsecured lines of credit in the U.S., he said.","For its charter bid to be successful, however, Revolut will need to convince regulators that banking and crypto products can coexist within the same service.","\u201CCrypto\u2019s one of their top questions. \u2018Well, how is crypto going to be handled, inside or outside the bank?\u2019 That\u2019s the key question. Is crypto inside or outside the bank?\u201D said Oliveira. \u201CFor us, crypto is outside the bank... How it\u2019s structured is that if you have the Revolut app and you want to buy crypto, you\u2019re not going into the bank to buy that, you\u2019re going outside the bank. You\u2019re going to a different entity to do that.\u201D","The proposed structure is reminiscent of the model adopted by Zopa, the British peer-to-peer lender founded in 2005. The company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zopa.com\/blog\/article\/zopa-launches-new-digital-bank-offering-consumers-a-compelling-alternative-when-they-need-it-most\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched a licensed bank<\/a> in the United Kingdom in the summer of 2020, which it now runs alongside \u2014 but segmented from \u2014 its peer-to-peer lending business.","Â© 2023 The Block.
