A minute later, the popular crypto news Twitter account DB also tweeted the new Twitter logo, prompting Tree of Alpha to start buying Dogecoin. He <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Tree_of_Alpha\/status\/1643180933233745924\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bought<\/a> $3 million worth of Dogecoin, followed by $2 million and a final buy worth $3 million.","His average buying price was around $0.0815 and he exited around $0.095, resulting in over a million worth of profit, he said.","\"This is actually my biggest trade of the year by far,\" Tree of Alpha said. \"Trading takes a lot of patience, but eventually, you will come across a handful of trades that you need to absolutely nail like this Doge one.
