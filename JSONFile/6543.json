The prover is responsible for generating cryptographic proofs to compress transactions and improve the efficiency of Layer 2 scaling.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The open-sourcing of the StarkNet Prover will allow for more individuals to review the code, helping to detect bugs and increase transparency. This move may also be viewed as a positive step toward greater decentralization of the StarkNet, the team said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of StarkWare and co-inventor of ZK-STARKs, commented on the open-sourcing, saying, \"This marks a significant step for scaling Ethereum and cryptography, as STARK technology becomes a publicly available resource.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">StarkNet was launched on the Ethereum mainnet in November 2021 in alpha stage, and since then the StarkWare team has gradually open-sourced elements of the StarkNet stack, including the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189798\/starkware-open-sources-latest-version-of-its-cairo-programming-language\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cairo 1.0<\/a> programming language, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/201471\/starkware-rolls-out-open-source-client-papyrus-for-starknet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Papyrus<\/a> client software and the StarkNet sequencer. Today's decision will mark the completion of open-sourcing the full StarkNet software stack once implemented in near future, the team said.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
