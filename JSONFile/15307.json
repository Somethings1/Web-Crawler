If such a scenario plays out, it will likely help support bitcoin\u2019s price.","Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works","Crypto miner Griid Infrastructure, which is going public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Adit EdTech Acquisition Corp., has already signed a supply agreement with Intel to potentially buy the chip maker's new ASIC miners, according to a filing.","Meanwhile, payments giant Block said on Jan. 13 that it's going ahead with its plan to build an open-source bitcoin mining system to make \u201Cmining more distributed and efficient.\u201D If this feature is integrated with Cash App, it might increase the use of bitcoin to pay for goods and services by its users, furthering bitcoin adoption by the masses, Sotiriou noted.","\u201CIf successful, this will dramatically increase bitcoin\u2019s use case as a means of exchange, rather than just a store of value \u2013 this would result in significantly more adoption and hence help bitcoin reach price figures of over $100,000,\u201D he said.","Bitcoin is now trading near $42,000 since reaching its all-time high of just under $69,000 in November. The stocks of some miners, which are highly leveraged to the price of the crypto currency they mine, have tumbled more than 50% since their peak."],"entity":[{"type":"Crypto miner Griid Infrastructure","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sotiriou","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"How Bitcoin Mining Works","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Intel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cash App","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$69,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Jan. 13","content":"DATE"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jan. 18","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Marcus Sotiriou","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$100,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$42,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"ESG","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Adit EdTech Acquisition Corp.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$200+ billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Intel","Square","Square Crypto","Bitcoin Mining"],"authors":["Aoyon Ashraf"]}
