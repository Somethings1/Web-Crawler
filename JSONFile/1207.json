Wintermute's Evgeny Gaevoy said that market makers re-examining their exposure to certain venues in the wake of the FTX meltdown is one driving factor behind the liquidity dry-up.","\"This liquidity crunch can be explained by two factors,\" Wintermute's Gaevoy said. \"On one hand, MMs having less access to BTC borrow since most of lenders are overly cautious or outright dead. Parallel to that MMs are aggressively reducing their exposure to most centralized exchanges as the full extent of contagion is unclear.\"","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
