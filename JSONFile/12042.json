The DAI stablecoin is currently backed 32% by USDC, <a href=\"https:\/\/daistats.com\/#\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to daistats.","Christensen made the remarks on the MakerDAO Discord channel on Thursday. The MakerDAO co-founder said the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162105\/us-treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-mixer-tornado-cash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">US Treasury sanctions<\/a> against crypto mixing service Tornado Cash was the reason for considering the pivot. According to Christensen, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162251\/tornado-cash-sanctions-leave-industry-leaders-wondering-whats-next\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the sanctions are more serious<\/a> than he originally considered.&nbsp;Centre, the consortium behind USDC, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162172\/circle-freezes-usdc-funds-in-tornado-cashs-us-treasury-sanctioned-wallets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">froze USDC funds<\/a> in Tornado Cash wallets following the sanctions.&nbsp;","\"Will be discussing it at tonight's call but I think we should seriously consider preparing to depeg from USD ... it is almost inevitable that it will happen and it is only realistic to do with huge amounts of preparation,\" said Christensen.","By abandoning its USDC exposure, the DAI stablecoin could lose its US dollar peg. This is because DAI\u2019s current peg is maintained via something called a \u201Cprice stability module\u201D or PSM. The PSM enables the minting of DAI for acceptable collateral such as USDC and ether (ETH) at a fixed rate. This fixed rate requires a little more than $1 of the collateral to mint $1 worth of DAI.","According to data from Makerburn, DAI is over 80% backed by stablecoins of which USDC is in the majority. As such, if MakerDAO sells its USDC for something like ETH, DAI could lose its $1 peg due to a disruption of the PSM. Christensen says this is an acceptable risk and the MakerDAO community is set to discuss the matter in a governance call today.","Christensen\u2019s comments have drawn criticism from several notable crypto personalities. Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1557746114526314501\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">called<\/a> it a \u201Crisky and terrible idea,\u201D adding that a significant decline in the spot price of ETH could see the collateral backing for DAI becoming undervalued.","Robert Leshner, the founder of DeFi protocol Compound Finance, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rleshner\/status\/1557751458048737281\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">argued<\/a> that the move could affect DAI\u2019s stability. According to Leshner, this could have implications for the DeFi space as a whole. \u201CConverting DAI into a price-elastic asset will ruin it, full stop,\u201D Leshner added.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This article was updated to reflect that DAI is backed 32% by USDC and not 60% as originally published.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
