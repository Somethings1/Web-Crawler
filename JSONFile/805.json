Reentrancy is a Solidity programming language vulnerability that allows an attacker to trick a protocol\u2019s contract into making an external call to an untrusted contract. Once this happens, the hacker can then use this untrusted contract to make repeated calls to the protocol to drain its funds.","In the case of Agave and Hundred Finance, the attacker introduced a reentrancy bug on both protocols paving the way for a flash loan exploit. The reentrancy vulnerability appears centered on the \u201CcallAfterTransfer\u201D function, allowing the hackers to continue borrowing from the protocols \u2014 siphoning off massive swathes of liquidity.","In essence, the attacker was making recursive calls to siphon off user funds without having to put up additional collateral. Then the attacker terminated the exploit with a \u201CliquidationCall,\u201D paying back their initial flash loan while still holding significant liquidity from both projects.","The attacker has begun to <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x0a16a85be44627c10cee75db06b169c7bc76de2c#tokentxns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launder<\/a> the funds via Tornado Cash, but <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xd041ad9aae5cf96b21c3ffcb303a0cb80779e358#tokentxns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Etherscan<\/a> hasn't labeled their address as associated with a DeFi exploit as of the time of writing.","Agave is a lending protocol on the Gnosis chain and is a fork of the popular Aave protocol. Hundred Finance is a multi-chain lending project and is a fork of Compound.","Cream Finance, a DeFi lending protocol that shares a similar codebase to Compound, also suffered a flash loan reentrancy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/116055\/creamfinance-exploited-in-18-8-million-flash-loan-attack\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">attack last summer<\/a>.
