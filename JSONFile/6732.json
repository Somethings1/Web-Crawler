The answer will likely have major implications for the government's power to control the functions of digital assets.&nbsp;","Coinbase is sponsoring a lawsuit brought by six Tornado Cash users against the U.S. Treasury Department, which last month sanctioned the currency mixer for its alleged role in laundering illicit funds. The exchange and other cryptocurrency advocates fear the application of such powers could disrupt broader networks unrelated to illegal activities, like the entire Ethereum blockchain, and create yet another massive legal uncertainty for the industry.&nbsp;","\u201CThe power that\u2019s delegated to OFAC simply authorizes them to target persons or property,\u201D Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, told The Block. \u201CThe smart contracts that they\u2019re talking about,\u201D that enable Tornado Cash, \u201Cthese are neither persons nor property.\u201D&nbsp;","The U.S. government, which has yet to file a response, will likely want to preserve broad powers to cut off funds to criminals, which in this case, include North Korean government-backed hackers. According to Treasury, Tornado Cash was used to launder over $7 billion since 2019, including $455 million stolen by a group sponsored by Pyongyang.&nbsp;","Brian Nelson, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, laid out Treasury\u2019s stark view of the matter when the department announced its sanctions against the currency mixer last month.&nbsp;","\u201CDespite public assurances otherwise, Tornado Cash has repeatedly failed to impose effective controls designed to stop it from laundering funds for malicious cyber actors on a regular basis and without basic measures to address its risks,\u201D Nelson said in a release. \u201CTreasury will continue to aggressively pursue actions against mixers that launder virtual currency for criminals and those who assist them.\u201D","A spokesperson for Treasury declined further comment. As is typical in challenges to government decisions, the Justice Department will represent Treasury in the case.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dueling Precedents<\/strong>","Though legal precedent in the U.S.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/cases\/bernstein-v-us-dept-justice\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> maintains source code as free speech under the First Amendment<\/a> as a result of another national security-related case, judges often defer to the U.S. government on deterrence decisions like sanctions. Lawyers with backgrounds in national security expect the attempt to fail. &nbsp;","\u201COFAC will argue that Tornado Cash, decentralized or not, was the go-to money laundering mechanism for Lazarus Group which resulted in North Korea having funds for weapons proliferation,\" said Ari Redbord, a former Treasury sanctions attorney who is now head of legal and government affairs for TRM, a consulting firm for digital currency-related projects.","Though digital currencies like bitcoin and ether have been involved&nbsp;in other sanctions and criminal cases, the U.S. government hasn\u2019t come down on them like it did with Tornado Cash. The sanctions were likely the result of Tornado Cash being used by North Korean hackers and a TRM<a href=\"https:\/\/www.trmlabs.com\/post\/u-s-treasury-sanctions-widely-used-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> analysis<\/a> estimating that 41% of all funds deposited through its mixing pools in June and July were stolen assets. Historically, Treasury sees its sanctions role as one of its most important responsibilities\u2014doing what it can to hinder terrorism or nuclear programs of authoritarian, belligerent regimes without loss of life.","Still, Coinbase appears ready for a lengthy fight. The exchange sought out the most sympathetic plaintiffs it could find, including two of its own employees.","One, Tyler Almeida, says he used Tornado Cash to donate to Ukraine\u2019s government following Russia\u2019s invasion of the country. Former Amazon engineer Joseph Van Loon says he used Tornado Cash mixing pools\u2014code that hides transactions from being public on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain by pooling them with several other simultaneous anonymized transactions to create a sort of virtual safety deposit room\u2014to keep from being targeted by hackers who could otherwise see where the ether moved.","Coinbase matched these six users\u2014two of whom are employees of the company\u2014with the chair of the Supreme Court and appellate practice group at international law firm Paul Weiss: Kannon Shanmugam. He is an ex-clerk to former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and lead counsel in a high-profile legal challenge over whether the president can replace the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at will\u2013a challenge he won in a 5-4 Supreme Court decision.","Because of Coinbase\u2019s bankroll, the plaintiffs, and Shanmugam\u2019s legal pedigree, experts see the suit as having a chance of success, despite significant hurdles.","\u201CI think that the plaintiffs that they have gotten are excellent, exactly who I would want, and the arguments that they have made are excellent as well,\u201D said Jerry Brito, executive director of the D.C.-based nonprofit Coin Center, which is also weighing a legal challenge to the sanctions.","Treasury seemed to undercut standing for a lawsuit when, on Sept. 13, OFAC issued guidance for how Tornado Cash users who still have funds in the frozen pools but did not engage in illicit activities can apply for exemptions.&nbsp;","\u201COFAC would have a favorable licensing policy towards such applications, provided that the transaction did not involve other sanctionable conduct,\u201D the <a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/policy-issues\/financial-sanctions\/faqs\/1079\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">guidance reads<\/a>.","Brito rejected that Treasury\u2019s notice would affect the case much.","\u201CThat shouldn\u2019t change the case because there\u2019s still an injury here,\u201D said Brito. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t change the fact that they sanctioned something that cannot be sanctioned under law.\u201D","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Network Effects<\/strong>","Legal experts following the lawsuit see the Tornado Cash sanctions as a distinct next step beyond the \u2018code is speech\u2019 precedent\u2014one with potentially broad implications for digital assets. If the government wins and can continue to target specific code running on a blockchain, advocates fear there will be little to stop it from targeting that entire blockchain.","\u201CThe worry here is that OFAC criminalizes basic infrastructure, basic crypto ecosystem infrastructure without knowing about it,\u201D said Ahmed Ghappour, a professor at Boston University\u2019s law school and chief legal officer for privacy-focused blockchain project Nym.","Brito echoed concern about government sanctions affecting broader networks like Ethereum, where a majority of users probably aren\u2019t state-sponsored hackers.&nbsp;","\u201CI think this is not so much an attack on the freedom to publish code, but instead an assault on the freedom to run specific code,\u201D Brito said.","He went on to echo arguments made by Coinbase and the plaintiffs which say that current sanctions law can\u2019t apply to code because of how it\u2019s written. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CIf your right as an American to privacy is only if North Koreans never use that tool,\u201D Brito said, \u201CThen you don\u2019t have a right to privacy.\u201D","&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Correction<\/strong>:<\/em> <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kannon Shanmugam's last name was originally misspelled as 'Shanmugan', The Block regrets the error.&nbsp;<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
