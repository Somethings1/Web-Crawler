An investment in Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX, which collapsed in November, was entirely wiped out, while Tiger also marked down investments in NFT marketplace OpenSea, Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs, payments firm MoonPay, decentralized wireless network startup Helium and Sam Altman\u2019s eyeball scanning protocol Worldcoin, according to the report.","Tiger had invested $126.8 million in OpenSea \u2014 an investment now worth just $30.2 million, according to The Information.","That chimes with wider reporting that shares in prized crypto companies are available on secondary market platforms at steep discounts. On March 8, The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/217937\/opensea-consensys-among-prized-crypto-startups-with-shares-available-at-big-discounts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that some OpenSea shares were trading at a 51% discount on Birel.io, a secondary marketplace.","After emerging as one of the tech sector\u2019s biggest investors, Tiger has suffered a period of sustained losses. In November 2022, its flagship hedge fund <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/9d63cd68-7a6e-4cb5-ab41-4b92562b79b4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported losses<\/a> of 54.7% for the year. Later, in March, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/tiger-global-writes-down-venture-funds-bets-by-33-in-2022-3f9f6ade\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that Tiger had marked down the value of its private funds by an average of 33% in 2022.","Tiger\u2019s venture fund has to date invested more than $11 billion, according to The Information report. Close to a quarter of that cash has been plowed into a category of companies described as enterprise software as a service, with fintech and crypto being Tiger\u2019s second and third biggest investment categories, respectively.","In total, Tiger has backed around 250 startups through the venture fund, of which more than 170 were worth less in December last year than when the firm first invested \u2014 suggesting crypto price tags are falling at least somewhat in line with the wider tech startup space.","Tiger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
