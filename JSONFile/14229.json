MicroStrategy announced yesterday it had made a further <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281654\/microstrategy-bitcoin-205000-btc-blackrock\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">purchase<\/a> of 12,000 BTC, retaking the lead by reaching 205,000 BTC. However, IBIT is likely to exceed the business intelligence firm\u2019s bitcoin assets again today.","In U.S. dollar terms, Bitwise\u2019s BITB also became the fifth U.S. spot bitcoin ETF to hold more than $2 billion in assets yesterday. \u201CWe now have five U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs over $2 billion in assets with BITB joining the club,\u201D Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/JSeyff\/status\/1767318826461389270?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a> on X. \u201COut of ~3,500 U.S. ETPs there are only 445 with over $2 billion in assets.

FBTC is getting close.\u201D","In comparison, assets held by Grayscale\u2019s higher fee GBTC fund have fallen by 37% from around 619,000 BTC to 388,000 BTC in the same period \u2014 now holding less than the newborn nine combined. While the GBTC outflows in bitcoin terms have been substantial, in U.S. dollar terms, the fund has retained the same AUM since the ETFs began trading on Jan. 11. \u201C~$11 billion in outflows for GBTC since converting to an ETF and it currently has about the same AUM that it had when it converted ($28.6 billion vs $28 billion),\u201D Seyffart <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/JSeyff\/status\/1767323954459316499?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">added<\/a>. \u201CPrice appreciation is a helluva drug. Bull market subsidy is in full effect here.\u201D","GBTC\u2019s outflows accelerated again over the past couple of weeks, coinciding with a court ruling that the now-bankrupt crypto brokerage firm Genesis can sell over $1.3 billion worth of GBTC shares, intending to repay creditors in kind.
