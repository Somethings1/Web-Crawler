The company\u2019s current CRM solution registers customer data on its proprietary blockchain, although it will soon integrate with the Binance Chain and eventually become blockchain agnostic, according to Cere Network co-founder Kenzi Wang. This means that enterprises adopting Cere Network's solution will be indirectly using Binance's blockchain services in the near future.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe can bring a lot of real-world brands to Binance, so they see it as a long-term play integrating with us and they chose to work with us and incubate us,\u201D said Wang.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The CRM space Cere Network trying to disrupt is one of the most lucrative and competitive software categories, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/louiscolumbus\/2019\/06\/22\/salesforce-now-has-over-19-of-the-crm-market\/#3279b0f7333a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sitting on a $48.2 billion market cap<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in 2018.
