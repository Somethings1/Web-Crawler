Contracts can pay out in either dollars, BTC or a USD stablecoin. Their durations will be flexible and bespoke according to counterparty needs.","Contract terms will be structured according to a locked-in price, daily hashrate being sold and the duration of the contract.&nbsp;","The company said this is just the first of \"many derivatives\" that it plans to launch next year.","\"Hashprice derivatives are the apotheosis of our vision of hashrate as an asset class,\" said Luxor co-founder and CEO Nick Hansen.","Â© 2023 The Block.
