The startup said it recently raised $6.2 million in funding led by Initialized Capital and iNovia, with participation from Fidelity Investments Canada, FJ Labs, and Ferst Capital.","Alex Daskalov, co-founder and CEO of KNØX, told The Block that the round formally closed in June 2018, and that the firm had been operating \u201Csilently\u201D since then. Now with the public launch, financial institutions, including asset managers, liquidity providers, and exchanges, can sign up to KNØX\u2019s services.","KNØX said it provides up to 100% insurance coverage via its partner and insurance giant Marsh. \u201COur custodial service capable of insuring the full value of a customer's assets,\u201D Daskalov told The Block.","Other offerings in the market give \u201Ca false sense of security,\u201D KNØX claimed. Giving an example, it said:","\u201CA customer with $100 million in digital assets may choose to keep their funds with a custodian holding $1 billion in assets, and advertising a $100 million insurance policy. The custodian is 10% insured, yet the customer is given a false sense of security believing that the $100 million policy will be able to cover their holdings. In fact, in the event of a total loss, the customer will be reimbursed $10 million, forced to accept a $90 million loss. The total limit is most commonly shared across clients.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nMarsh senior vice president, Jennifer Hustwitt, told The Block: \u201CThere are a wide range of risks related to crypto assets that remain uninsured, but the insurance market for digital assets is expanding. Over the past six months, we have seen a net expansion of insurance capacity as the technology continues to mature and regulatory frameworks emerge.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nKNØX is currently offering an insured cold storage custody service, and charges customers a fee based on their assets held under custody and based on the insurance allocation they select, which can be as high as 100% of the value of their holdings, Daskalov told The Block.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nKNØX said that it received the first \"multi-million dollar deposit\" of bitcoin (BTC) in the summer of 2018, and has been expanding operations since then.","Interestingly, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/fidelitys-bitcoin-custody-business-is-live-a-conversation-with-fidelity-digital-assets-head-tom-jessop-15048\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fidelity itself<\/a> officially launched its bitcoin custodial service earlier this year.
