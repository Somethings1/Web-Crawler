For context, some biggest Chinese bitcoin mining farms had about 3 gigawatts of hydropower electricity during the rainy season last year.","To move Ukraine's proposal forward, certain issues need to be ironed out first, according to Vladimirov. These include regulatory, legal, research, and calculations of required electricity, among other factors.","Hotmine is \"convinced\" that Ukraine can become one of the world's leaders in crypto mining with its affordable nuclear power generation.","For the next steps, Hotmine, Energoatom, and the Ministry of Energy will consider signing a memorandum, which will define specific measures to establish a crypto mining center.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/64189\/ukraines-nuclear-power-plants-may-start-mining-cryptocurrencies\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The official discussion follows a proposal from last May<\/a> when Ukraine's acting energy minister Olha Buslavets advised Energoatom to consider using excess electricity for mining cryptocurrencies.","Ukraine has recently been active in the crypto space. Last month, the country's Ministry of Digital Transformation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/89987\/cbdc-ukraine-stellar-memorandum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">partnered with the Stellar Development Foundation<\/a> to develop the virtual assets ecosystem and a central bank digital currency of Ukraine.
