During the conversation, Kulechov said that he believes smaller banks and private firms will be among the institutional world's early adopters of DeFi.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think the biggest banks are more in the state of actually learning and getting education on the fly, and they will not be the early movers,\" he said. \"But the early movers will be the banks that are smaller banks, private banks, and are exposed one way into the crypto space.\"<\/span>","As one might expect, the interview with Kulechov swung toward a popular one in the crypto space today: virtual worlds, gaming and the so-called Metaverse, the latter being a catch-all phrase for the different platforms and services that compromise an immersive digital experience.","Kulechov<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> likened the way users spend time playing games in the Metaverse to the way people log time in a physical space like a cafe or workspace. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CGames becomes more of an economy the same way as we're spending times sitting in a cafe, workspaces or having dinners or meeting friends.\u201D He also related the use of finance tools in DeFi protocols to playing games and shopping in a brand\u2019s store in the metaverse.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For Aave in particular, this area is being explored via the launch of Aavegotchi, which began its first land auctions this October. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt's just like a completely new world that can be not just an experiment, but it could become reality,\" said Kulechov.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While DeFi remains the focus of Aave, Kulechov sees a range of possibilities for similar architectures outside of DeFi. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kulechov discovered that while DeFi protocols applied nicely to finance, a similar architecture could be created to build a social platform.
