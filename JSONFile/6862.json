And that backdrop is forcing investors to explore DeFi.","That\u2019s part of the logic behind the recently announced <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/compound-finance\/announcing-compound-treasury-for-businesses-institutions-83d4484fb82e\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Compound Treasury<\/a>, a new company that allows investors and firms to access the yields on Compound without engaging directly with the blockchain.","On this episode of The Scoop, Compound Labs\u2019 Founder Robert Leshner unpacks how institutional flows hunting for yield are finding their way to DeFi \u2014 and how he sees Compound Treasury playing a role facilitating that migration.","\u201CCompound Treasury is what we hope is an embodiment of this, where we can source the yields from the compound protocol and pass it to institutional customers and abstract away all of the nuance of interacting with smart contracts and managing the flow of funds.\" Leshner predicted that over time, DeFi and traditional finance will become more intertwined.","\u201CI think over time, yields will converge,\u201D he noted. Until then, fintechs will look to services like Compound Treasury to juice yields which have been on a downward spiral. Wealthfront \u2014 which at one point offered a return of 2.5% APY for cash accounts \u2014 currently offers 0.10% APY. Robinhood offers 0.30%.","There are a number of factors that are playing into high DeFi yields, including the existence of \u201Cnatural risk premiums\u201D in DeFi compared to traditional technical risks in legacy finance. He posited how DeFi could prove to be more resilient against risk relative to traditional financial systems in the long run:","\u201CYou have what I would call \u2018natural risk premiums\u2019 that exist in DeFi that don't exist in traditional markets. The best being technical risk. So technical risk is the risk that the protocol itself just breaks in an unexpected way. Now, longterm, DeFi is safer infrastructure than anything in traditional markets. The reason being a smart contract when it's immutable, if it works, it'll work forever.\u201D&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
