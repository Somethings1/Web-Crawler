The commission argues that those changes, and the feedback from industry, experts and customers that the agency solicits as part of its rulemaking process are part of its consideration of whether completely new rules around digital assets are needed.","\u201CThe information gathered from any or all of these efforts could inform the Commission\u2019s consideration of its regulatory approach in this area, including its consideration of the regulatory approaches suggested in Coinbase\u2019s petition,\u201D the SEC says in its filing.","Citing multiple public documents issued by the agency over the years, including a widely publicized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/litigation\/investreport\/34-81207.pdf\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/litigation\/investreport\/34-81207.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684290490726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw39itySnGLA5VK4p2hRBSkU\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2017 report<\/a> on the original Decentralized Autonomous Organization and the tokens it issued, the SEC also argues that it has provided digital asset guidance outside of enforcement actions over the years.","Coinbase petitioned the commission for new digital asset rules at the same time that the commission accused a former Coinbase executive of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/209149\/former-coinbase-product-manager-pleads-guilty-to-criminal-charges-in-landmark-case\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/209149\/former-coinbase-product-manager-pleads-guilty-to-criminal-charges-in-landmark-case&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684291200869000&amp;usg=AOvVaw18c7Yu6i5GqmxFZZSwz6Oz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the first ever insider trading case involving cryptocurrency<\/a>.
