After his crypto empire filed for bankruptcy protection, Bankman-Fried could face criminal charges \u2014 with his own tweets supplementing the evidence \u2014 legal experts say.&nbsp;","FTX and more than 100 of its corporate affiliates filed for bankruptcy on Friday, the finale of a shocking collapse for the world\u2019s second-largest crypto exchange. At the same time, Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO of the company he founded three years ago, which was worth $32 billion at its peak in January. By Friday his remaining $16 billion fortune was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186044\/sbfs-fortune-is-wiped-out-with-100-decline-bloombergs-billionaires-index-shows\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wiped out<\/a>.&nbsp;","In a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF_FTX\/status\/1590709199067295749\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweet thread<\/a> yesterday, Bankman-Fried apologized for the collapse and disclosed new details about disparities between his \u201Csense\u201D of the exchange\u2019s liquidity and user margin and the actual numbers.&nbsp;","\u201CCriminal charges are on the table. It's possible,\u201D said Teresa Goody Guillén, a partner in BakerHostetler\u2019s white collar and securities enforcement group. \u201CIn his series of tweets, he makes numerous admissions which could be used against him.\u201D","Multiple FTX spokespeople did not respond to inquiries.","Bankman-Fried has not yet been charged with any criminal wrongdoing, and bankruptcy proceedings could take years to complete. But&nbsp;the Justice Department could bring criminal charges against Bankman-Fried, according to a former deputy attorney general.&nbsp;","\u201CThey have to be looking at it,\u201D said Consensys attorney Bill Hughes, who served as a deputy U.S. attorney general.&nbsp;The DoJ has reportedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185129\/justice-department-joins-sec-in-ftx-probe-wsj\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">opened an investigation into the matter<\/a>.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tweeting through it<\/strong>","In an unusual move for the chief executive of a troubled company, Bankman-Fried posted lengthy comments on Twitter over the last week weighing in on the turmoil at FTX. First, Bankman-Fried insisted his company was \u201Cfine,\u201D and later apologized to customers for the \u201Cshitshow\u201D and said he accepted blame for the exchange\u2019s collapse. In a criminal court, his statements might be considered an admission of guilt.&nbsp;","\u201CHe gets into definitive disclosures of what the margin was and liquidity was,\u201D said Goody Guillén, who previously served as litigation counsel for the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201CIt\u2019s not only about admissions of potential wrongdoing, but he also made statements on which people relied that will be scrutinized for their truth.\u201D&nbsp;","Bankman-Fried\u2019s claims of lack of knowledge of the exchange\u2019s financial status and activities probably won\u2019t help him either.","\u201CHe\u2019s about to hear his lawyer tell him about a standard called \u2018knew or should have known,\u2019\u201D said John Roe, president of Roe Capital Management and a board member of the National Introducing Brokers Association, a commodities industry trade association. \u201CHow do you not know what your leverage was? That\u2019s insane.\u201D","Government lawyers will also scrutinize the former FTX CEO\u2019s tweets to see if he misled in order to prop up market prices.","\u201CThere's an issue of whether or not the statements in his tweets were accurate. And there's also an issue as to his intent in making the tweets, because they appear to have had market moving consequences,\u201D Goody Guillén added. \u201CIf it were determined, based on the facts and circumstances, for example, that those tweets were made with the intent to have market moving impact, that could be market manipulation and fraud.\"","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">More legal complications<\/strong>","Allegations of commingling customer assets to fund proprietary trading will also garner significant scrutiny from prosecutors and regulators.","\u201CThat is commingling of customer assets with funds, and I don\u2019t think most people thought they were betting on a proprietary bet,\u201D said Roe, who co-led a coalition of MF Global investors in litigation after that commodity brokerage went bankrupt in 2011. \u201CAnd if they were, that\u2019s jail.\u201D","The MF Global bankruptcy may serve as reference point for FTX and its affiliated firms. The company's CEO, Jon Corzine, a former U.S. senator and governor of New Jersey, faced civil penalties and was banned from the futures industry after the firm collapsed due to over-leveraged bets and poor risk management. But alleged mixing of customer assets with other pools of money controlled by the firm, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/164553\/fdic-issues-cease-and-desist-letters-to-ftx-us-other-crypto-firms-over-deposit-insurance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">false claims that accounts were FDIC-insured<\/a>, and certain public statements about the health of FTX US will likely receive a long look for potential prosecution.","\u201CJust being stupid and reckless with money is not a crime, but fraud is. Intentionally lying about the use of FTX customer assets is fraud,\u201D said Jim Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business.","The tangled nature of FTX\u2019s corporate structure, much of it intentionally left out of U.S. and spread across different jurisdictions, could further complicate any investigation. FTX\u2019s global reach also means that a wide range of authorities could be involved.","\u201CBuilding the evidence, building the facts, often takes time,\u201D SEC Chair Gary Gensler <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185310\/gensler-pressed-on-ftx-failure-warns-investors-to-be-careful-beware\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> during a recent TV appearance, acknowledging an ongoing investigation into the company.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With additional reporting by Colin Wilhelm.<\/em>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","© 2023 The Block.
