The data comes from <a href=\"https:\/\/beaconcha.in\/charts\/validators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">beaconcha.in<\/a>, which provides a number of data points about the network.","Validators are essentially the miners of the proof-of-stake blockchain. In order to participate in the network, they must stake 32 ETH. Validators function in part to create the next block of transactions, thereby extending the chain as new transactions are added to the network. They also store information about the network.","That\u2019s the amount of ETH deposited to date in Ethereum\u2019s staking contract. The contract was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/83545\/with-release-of-deposit-address-ethereum-2-0s-phase-0-launch-date-is-in-sight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">first launched<\/a> in November 2020 and kicked off the initial phase of Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake transition.","The above figure comes from a Dune Analytics dashboard maintained by Dune co-founder Fredrik Haga.","To date, there are almost 80,000 unique depositors who have contributed funds to the staking contract and, thus have set aside the necessary funds to become a validator.","According to the data collected by Haga, the biggest depositor has deposited 288,160 ETH to the address.","Yes, that <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.ethereum.org\/2022\/08\/24\/mainnet-merge-announcement\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">eye-popping number<\/a> has a significant meaning for Ethereum's Merge.","It refers to a value known as Terminal Total Difficulty, which is the trigger point at which Ethereum will actually shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.&nbsp;","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted earlier this month about the number's setting, stating that \"[t]his means the ethereum [proof-of-work] network now has a (roughly) fixed number of hashes left to mine.\"","This last number is only indirectly related to the Ethereum network itself but speaks to the attention being paid as of late to the upcoming upgrade.","61 was the most recent Google Trends score for \u201Cethereum merge\u201D in the United States, having reached 100 for August 11, as shown in the chart below.","","","Looking at the worldwide data, \u201Cethereum merge\u201D similarly peaked on August 11, having scored a 65 on August 25.","","","Â© 2023 The Block.
