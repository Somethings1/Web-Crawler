The U.S., EU and other nations have imposed financial sanctions against Russia in an effort to have it back down from its invasion of Ukraine. Earlier on Wednesday, the European Union cut seven of Russia\u2019s largest banks off from the SWIFT interbank messaging system.","Powell referred to the possibility that terrorists or other malicious actors could use cryptocurrency as further examples of the need for additional regulation.","Powell is testifying in front of the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday on the state of the economy and monetary policy. He will report to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.","Congressman Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) asked about the Fed\u2019s recent reports on central bank digital currencies.

He said that the central bank was set to raise its policy rate but that the situation in the Ukraine may have changed expectations.","Still, he told Congress his expectation is that inflation will peak and \u201Ccome down\u201D by the end of this year.","Powell said he\u2019s inclined to impose and support a 25 basis point rate hike in March.","Traders have been pricing in a possible rate hike since the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s two-day meeting in March, however, it was unclear until now by how many basis points.","The CME Group's FedWatch tool showed this morning that futures traders see a 90% chance of a quarter-percentage point hike, as opposed to a half-percentage point, which many thought was very likely just a week ago.","UPDATE (March 2, 2022, 16:05 UTC): Adds additional context."],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"this morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"European Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federal Open Market Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CME Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Juan Vargas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jerome Powell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Calif.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 2, 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Senate Banking Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"House Financial Services Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Jerome Powell","CBDCs","Ukraine","Russia"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De","Helene Braun"]}
