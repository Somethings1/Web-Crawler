According to the complaint, Bankman-Fried\u2019s father Joseph, a Stanford University law professor, then transferred nearly $7 million to his personal accounts at Morgan Stanley and TD Ameritrade; he lost over $1 million in the remaining FTX US account funds on failed cryptocurrency trades.","Lawyers for the company claim that Bankman-Fried is now using the remaining funds he gave his father to fund his own criminal defense.","In another instance detailed in the lawsuit, a plan was created to purchase Nauru, a sovereign island microstate within Micronesia, in order to create a post-apocalyptic haven for believers in effective altruism. Sam Bankman-Fried vocally espoused the philosophy, which essentially boils down to making as much money as possible in order to give away as much as possible to worthy causes.&nbsp;","\u201COne memo exchanged between Gabriel Bankman-Fried and an officer of the FTX Foundation describes a plan to purchase the sovereign nation of Nauru in order to construct a \u2018bunker \/ shelter\u2019 that would be used for \u2018some event where 50%-99.99% of people die [to] ensure that most EAs [effective altruists] survive\u2019 and to develop \u2018sensible regulation around human genetic enhancement, and build a lab there,\u2019\u201D the complaint quotes the younger Bankman-Fried as writing.","Adds the bankruptcy complaint: \u201CThe memo further noted that \u2018probably there are other things it\u2019s useful to do with a sovereign country, too.\u2019\u201D","A spokesperson for Gabriel Bankman-Fried claims that he was not involved in the creation of the memo. \u201CGabriel Bankman-Fried did not create, endorse, contribute to, or draft a plan to acquire the island of Nauru. In truth, Gabe received by email a link to the memo, which he did not write or request, and did not forward to anyone else,\u201D they said.","According to the complaint, the FTX Foundation received money that included funds commingled with FTX customer money. Lawyers filing the complaint also claim that a majority of the $35 million Sam Bankman-Fried directed to Guarding Against Pandemics, another charity established by the Bankman-Frieds \u2014 one that unusually had its own political donation arm \u2014 came from Alameda Research accounts.<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/strong>","The complaint also echoes previous allegations that Bankman-Fried, Singh and another, unnamed FTX Group senior executive made over $100 million in political donations. Most of the money came from funds commingled with FTX customer money, the complaint claims, while occasionally funding for the donations came from \"purported loans\" from the FTX group.","Those donations relate to one of the criminal charges Bankman-Fried faces.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This article has been updated to show Gabriel Bankman-Fried was not the author of the memo.<\/em>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
