Still, missed in many of the news stories covering the launch was information about a key partner for the fund: its designated market maker.&nbsp;","Evolve picked Virtu Financial \u2014 the $5 billion publicly traded market-making firm \u2014 as its DMM. The DMM plays a big role in the launch of a new fund, supporting liquidity for the product as well as redemptions. Virtu will support large block trades in the product for institutions looking to put on large positions, according to a source.","Virtu will purchase the underlying to conduct such a block trade, leveraging Gemini's clearing service, the source added.","The news is noteworthy, given it is the first crypto-tied product for which Virtu is serving as a designated market maker. Although high-speed trading firms were among the first financial services firms to embrace the volatility of the crypto market, Virtu has been more conservative, avoiding attention in the nascent market.&nbsp;","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fast-growing market<\/strong>","As for EBIT, its market debut has been dwarfed by another Canadian ETF, BTCC, which has clocked in eye-popping volumes since it began trading last week and has seen its AUM top $400 million.","As noted by Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas, BTCC's volumes on Friday were three times more than any other ETF and \"proportionally speaking\" equivalent to $5 billion in volumes for a US fund.&nbsp;","Still, Balchunas said that EBIT had a healthy debut, noting in a message to The Block that \"normally a new launch is lucky to be in Top 100 most traded Day One.\"","\"#1 by 3x over simply doesn't happen,\" he remarked.","<script async=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/script>","As for Virtu's aspirations, the firm is eying the US market for upcoming new fund products.","Although an ETF hasn't been approved in the US, there is a long list of firms from Grayscale to VanEck to Bitwise that could enter the market should securities regulators shift their stance on whether to approve such products.","In a sense, those aspirations square with Virtu's broader aim to bulk up its customer-facing block trading desk. The firm maintains a specialized desk that offers execution in \"harder-to-trade\" orders in blocks.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":[]}
