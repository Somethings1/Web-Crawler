The mainnet is permissionless, and anyone can bridge assets and use them in zkEVM native apps, according to the development team.","&nbsp;\"With zkEVM, you will be able to deploy any Ethereum application without any modifications, using existing Ethereum developer tools like Remix, and interact with the network using standard wallets like Metamask,\" Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic said in an interview. \"Close to 6,000 smart contracts were deployed on the testnet without any single modification without any problem.\"","A ZK-rollup is a Layer 2 scaling solution for blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, that sets out to improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction fees. It works by aggregating a large number of transactions off-chain into a single batch, which is then submitted to the main chain as a single transaction. Most ZK-rollups don't have natively supported Ethereum applications, which is starting to change with the public release of a few zkEVMs.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The launch of Polygon's zkEVM has attracted more than 50 projects from the crypto, web3 and gaming spaces, including dApps such as Lens and Aavegotchi, DeFi projects 0xvix and Quickswap, as well as Etherscan, Phantom, Midnight Society, Luganodes, Celer, Gameswift, and Yeeha Games.
