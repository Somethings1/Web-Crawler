Applicants must be established in the European Union or in a state party to the European Economic Area agreement, and their applications must include a proposal for an experiment covering at least one of these three use cases:","Payment by means of a token, representing central bank money, against 1. delivery of a listed or unlisted financial instrument; 2. against a digital currency of another central bank; and 3. against digital assets as defined by Article L. 54-10-1 2° of the French Monetary and Financial Code.","\u201CThe Banque de France will not engage in money creation in the context of these experiments. The token reflecting the amount in euros in digital form will be destroyed at the end of the accounting day on which payment was made,\u201D said the central bank.","Applicants must submit applications by May 15.

However, we as central banks must and want to take up this call for innovation at a time when private initiatives \u2013 especially payments between financial players \u2013 and technologies are accelerating, and public and political demand is increasing. Other countries have paved the way; it is now up to us to play our part, both ambitiously and methodically.\u201C","The European Central Bank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/49307\/european-central-bank-is-in-favor-of-its-own-digital-currency-for-faster-and-cheaper-payments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">also once said<\/a> that it is willing to issue its own digital currency if the private sector fails to make cross-border payments faster and cheaper.","© 2023 The Block.
