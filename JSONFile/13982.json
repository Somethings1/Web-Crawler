The organization held bitcoin, stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies to defend UST\u2019s peg to the U.S. dollar.","The audit was <a href=\"https:\/\/lfg.org\/audit\/LFG-Audit-2022-11-14.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">performed<\/a> by JS Held, according to an LFG statement on Wednesday. The audit report stated that LFG spent 80,081 BTC and $49.8 million in stablecoins, amounting to $2.8 billion in total, to defend the UST peg. This defense happened during the Terra ecosystem's death spiral that occurred in May. At the time, UST lost its parity with the U.S. dollar, triggering a system-wide collapse of the Terra ecosystem \u2014 including its flagship crypto, Luna.","Apart from LFG\u2019s efforts, the report also stated that Terraform Labs, headed by Do Kwon, also tried to defend the UST peg. Terraform Labs reportedly spent $613 million of its own funds to defend the UST peg.","The JS Held audit report countered claims that LFG and Terraform Labs embezzled funds during the UST de-peg incident.&nbsp;\u201CThe report shows that all LFG funds were spent to defend UST\u2019s peg parity with the Dollar as declared and that LFG\u2019s remaining balances are the only funds remaining,\u201D the audit report stated.","<span class=\"citation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LFG balances between May 7 and May 16.

The report stated the wallet held over 3,300 BTC that Korean authorities were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/148253\/korean-police-seek-freeze-on-luna-foundation-guard-assets-kbs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">looking<\/a> to freeze. LFG <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/173269\/luna-foundation-guard-denies-reports-it-moved-bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">denied<\/a> the allegation at the time \u2014 and today\u2019s audit report supported LFG\u2019s position, stating that the organization has not moved any funds since May 16.","Kwon commented on the audit report, stating that it was important to distinguish between the Terra collapse and FTX\u2019s bankruptcy.","\u201CWhile there have been multiple recent failures in crypto, it is important to distinguish between Terra\u2019s case, where a transparent, open-source decentralized stablecoin failed to maintain peg parity and its creators spent proprietary capital to try to defend it, and the failure of centralized custodial platforms where its operators misused other people\u2019s money (customer funds) for financial gain,\u201D said Kwon.","With the audit published, attention could now shift towards compensation efforts for users affected by the Terra ecosystem collapse.
