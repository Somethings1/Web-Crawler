Sonic\u2019s rollout includes plans to enhance DeFi activities on Fantom through support for liquid staking tokens and the expansion of grant programs to fund development.","The team also plans to leverage Sonic as a \u201Cshared sequencer\u201D for other Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains \u2014 Kong noted. A shared sequencer is a party or protocol that produces blocks for multiple rollups simultaneously. They are essentially a pool of sequencers that can be used by multiple rollups. Other examples of shared sequencers in development include Espresso, Astria and FairBlock. Last year, the project noted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/news\/post\/243220\/fantom-optimistic-rollups-ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">exploring<\/a> adding optimistic rollups to connect to Ethereum.","\"Sonic will be used to create a new best-in-class shared sequencer for L1 and L2 chains, capable of processing over 180 million daily transactions with real, sub-second confirmation times, and serve as the foundation to relaunch Fantom as an entirely new community-centric brand,\" Kong <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fantom.foundation\/michael-kong-unveils-sonics-launch-and-beyond\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>.","Sonic's launch will be accompanied by proposed governance changes, including new staking mechanisms and a more decentralized and secure bridging solution to allow users to bridge funds from Ethereum. \u201CWe developed a Sonic rollup implementation, a first-class citizen in our validator set, to fully decentralize the bridge while using our existing network security plus inheriting Ethereum\u2019s economic security,\u201D Kong added.","With Sonic\u2019s rollout, a new bridge will be a critical infrastructure component for the foundation, particularly after last year\u2019s hack on a cross-chain bridge with Ethereum called Multichain. The foundation lost one-third of the total $210 million taken during the heist in July 2023, though <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fantom.foundation\/fantom-foundation-awarded-default-judgement-against-multichain\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recovery actions<\/a> are currently underway.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
