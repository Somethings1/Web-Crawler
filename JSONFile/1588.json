Quantstamp said it collaborated with the University of Toronto in developing the service, converting its initial academic research into a production-level tool.","The tool is not limited to analyzing only one specific contract or those belonging to a single client. Auditors (those checking the code for security flaws) can use this tool to analyze across various contracts from integrated DeFi protocols, Quantstamp added. However, while the tool\u2019s search process is automated, it does require some manual intervention for protocol-specific adaptations, and it doesn\u2019t guarantee the detection of all vulnerabilities.","Flash loan-based attacks are a significant concern in the DeFi space, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/219196\/euler-finance-flash-loan-attacked-for-an-estimated-197-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">siphoning off<\/a> around $200 million alone from the Euler Finance exploit in March.","Flash loans attract attackers aiming to exploit DeFi protocol vulnerabilities as they grant borrowers access to uncollateralized funds that can be leveraged to manipulate the protocols. However, they also carry substantial risk due to the borrower\u2019s obligation to repay within the same transaction. The complexity of these attacks often allows them to bypass standard code audits, potentially allowing hackers to carry out exploits.","\u201CDeFi has the potential to change the global financial infrastructure for the better, but its success requires preempting threats like flash loan attacks. We developed this tool to provide DeFi protocols an extra layer of security on top of audits,\u201D Quantstamp Head of New Initiatives Martin Derka said. \u201CAs DeFi evolves, security measures need to evolve with it. Services like Economic Exploit Analysis give us an edge against hackers.\u201D","Quantstamp\u2019s Economic Exploit Analysis service is currently available across all Ethereum-compatible chains, with the potential to be adapted for other blockchains in the future, the team said.","Flash loan attacks are responsible for an increasing proportion of stolen funds from DeFi projects, according to&nbsp;The Block\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/decentralized-finance\/exploits\/stolen-funds-by-using-flash-loans\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dashboard<\/a>.
