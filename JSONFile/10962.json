Once Luna\u2019s token price crashed, the rest of the Terra ecosystem went with it \u2014 wiping out some $40 billion of investor wealth in a few days.","But this time, the yield is real, the analysts said, accruing value based on the fees generated by the underlying application. Chhugani and Sapra cited Uniswap as an example amid its recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278840\/uniswap-foundation-proposal-suggests-turning-on-rewards-for-uni-token-holders\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposed<\/a> fee-sharing mechanism for UNI token stakers. The largest decentralized spot exchange generated $2 billion in trading volume during the last 24 hours \u2014 more than 50% of centralized exchange Coinbase\u2019s trading volume \u2014 and is the largest DeFi fee-generating protocol at around $3.7 million per day.","With the fee-sharing <a href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/uniswapgovernance.eth\/proposal\/0xad7e3612d11d56b21f0b2274e4ce825163bc1873d0e2ef809a3a98733df992a7\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">vote<\/a> currently underway, it could \u201Ctransform the token from a simple \u2018voting\u2019 token to a token with a yield, earned via protocol user fees,\u201D the analysts said, adding, \u201Cwe expect multiple DeFi protocols to follow.\u201D","Chhugani and Sapra noted concerns around the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s suggestion that all cryptocurrencies, excluding bitcoin, may be securities \u2014 though the crypto industry sees them as tokens connected to permissionless protocols without a specific investment contract.","\u201CThis is the fundamental question in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/274703\/will-a-judge-dismiss-the-secs-case-against-coinbase-experts-have-differing-views\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase vs SEC case<\/a>, which names 12 tokens as securities, alleging Coinbase as an unregistered securities exchange,\u201D the Bernstein analysts said. \u201CAs the courts in recent times have typically exercised more nuance than the blanket arguments followed by SEC (as seen in the Ripple vs SEC case), we believe the crypto industry is sensing an opportunity to change the \u2018legal\u2019 narrative on tokens.\u201D Bernstein has a 15% allocation to DeFi in its digital assets portfolio \u2014 up 15% year-to-date, they added.","This comes as the total value locked in DeFi has surged 50% since the year\u2019s start, moving from $60 billion to over $97 billion, based on The Block's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/total-value-locked-tvl\" data-v-02bbd79b=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data dashboard<\/a>.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/total-value-locked-tvl\/total-value-locked-by-category\/embed\" title=\"Value Locked by Category\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite continued significant outflows from Grayscale\u2019s converted GBTC fund, U.S. spot <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -0.48%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> ETFs continue to accumulate <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/BitMEXResearch\/status\/1763863079421403543?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">net inflows<\/a> overall \u2014 now accounting for a total net inflow of $7.4 billion.
