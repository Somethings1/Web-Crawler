Given this challenge and concerns over hacks, the report indicates an institutional preference for third-party custody providers due to their specialized capabilities and expertise.","\u201CMore institutional investors are recognizing the limitations of self-custodial solutions for their ongoing trading and operational needs. Instead, many institutions prefer third-party custody service providers,\u201D Aspen Digital said in a statement.","Over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockdata.tech\/markets\/use-cases\/custody-solutions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">120 custody providers<\/a>, including Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, are now operating in the space as of April 2023, according to Blockdata.","In its 2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/tech-effect\/emerging-tech\/metaverse-survey.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">metaverse survey<\/a>, PwC found that 82% of U.S. executives expected to integrate web3 into their operations within three years. However, in this latest report, most NFT self-custody solutions were also found to pose a challenge for institutional investors.","Digital asset custodians are, therefore, evolving beyond their traditional role of safeguarding cryptocurrencies to assist investors in navigating emerging asset classes such as DeFi, NFTs and the metaverse, Aspen Digital said.","\"Safekeeping of assets and ensuring they are segregated from client service providers' own (house) assets is a fundamental need,\u201D PwC digital assets and web3 co-lead Duncan Fitzgerald said in the statement. \u201CThis has applied for many years in the traditional securities industry \u2014 so I am pleased to see that there are credible options available now in the digital assets ecosystem.\"","\u201CFor institutional investors looking to allocate into digital assets, understanding the unique characteristics of custody solutions and providers compared with traditional assets is one of the biggest impediments when considering investment,\u201D Aspen Digital CEO Elliot Andrews added. \u201CImplementing the right digital asset custody solution is crucial for successful investment opportunities and to avoid significant asset losses.\u201D&nbsp;","Although institutional-grade digital asset custody solutions are in demand, concerns remain regarding asset security, fragmented regulations and comprehensive insurance coverage, Aspen Digital said. \u201CDigital asset custodians are addressing security risks through advanced technologies such as multi-party computation, keeping up with evolving regulations and meeting investors\u2019 expectations for insurance coverage across different types of digital assets,\u201D it added.","The report comes at a time of increased optimism surrounding the prospect of a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States, following the renewed race kicked off by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235056\/blackrock-takes-giant-leap-toward-spot-bitcoin-etf-with-sec-filing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlackRock<\/a> on June 15, with Coinbase listed as the custodian. If a spot bitcoin ETF application is approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it would provide another avenue for institutional investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without custodying the underlying asset themselves.","Last month, another PwC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/151474\/pwc-survey-sees-more-hedge-funds-investing-in-crypto-in-spite-of-volatility\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">survey<\/a> found more hedge funds investing in crypto, despite recent volatility.","Â© 2023 The Block.
