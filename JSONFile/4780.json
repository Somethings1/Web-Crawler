He pointed to on-chain data that showed declining bitcoin trading volume for both spot and derivative activity.","That concurs with data from The Block, which tracked the seven-day moving average of <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/total-exchange-volume-daily\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/total-exchange-volume-daily\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">daily spot volume<\/a> to having fallen below $10 billion for the first time since November 2020.","Dragosch said that perpetual and futures trading volumes continue to be comparatively low.","\"BTC futures and perpetual positioning has decreased significantly, option traders are more cautious when you look at BTC options' put-call ratios,\" he said. \"Short-term BTC traders have been realizing losses on-chain, especially during the latest sell-off at the end of August.\"","Another factor adding downside pressure is a possible divestment from crypto hedge funds, \"who still seem to be a bit overextended based on our analyses,\" Dragosch said. He said a decrease in macro liquidity, largely attributed to the tightening of central bank monetary policies, was also adding a downside factor, with a continuous shrinkage in stablecoin market caps indicating there is less \"dry powder\" available for investing in crypto assets like bitcoin.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","© 2023 The Block.
