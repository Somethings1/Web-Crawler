To that end, the central bank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bot.or.th\/Thai\/DigitalCurrency\/Documents\/BOT_RetailCBDCPaper.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has published a 59-page paper<\/a> laying out its approach in considering issuing a retail CBDC.","\"We believe that a retail CBDC would provide a valuable option for citizens to benefit from a digital currency that is accessible, reliable and safe,\" said the central bank. \"It would also lay the groundwork for a safe payment infrastructure, building the foundation for interoperability and collaboration with the private sector to drive financial innovation.\"","But the planned effort won't be without its risks and challenges. Hence, the exploration of retail CBDC \"must take into account policy implications, design decisions and risk mitigation measures,\" said the central bank.","The Bank of Thailand has also been engaged in work on wholesale digital currency through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/68850\/thailands-central-bank-will-prototype-digital-currency-based-payment-system-for-businesses\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Project Inthanon<\/a>, which focuses only on interbank payments.
