With a small population, Zug scored highest overall for opportunity measures due to the richness of its per-capita crypto-related companies and events. The hub also had the highest ranking in the two heaviest weighted criteria overall, regulatory structure (a \u201Cdriver\u201D and 35% of total weight,) and quality of life (an \u201Cenabler\u201D and 15%). Across the board, Zug had no glaring weaknesses.","For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk\u2019s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.","\n","The most iconic origin story in crypto is the Bitcoin white paper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. The runner-up? The Ethereum launch in 2015 by a baby-faced Vitalik Buterin, who feverishly worked out of a small apartment in Zug, Switzerland, alongside other coders.","\u201CIt was like a shoe box. A family house. People were living there on mattresses, almost like a hostel,\u201D Bernd Lapp, an early member of the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s advisory board, told me a few years ago. He remembers that Buterin was \u201Cvery kind, very nice\u201D and would shop for groceries, peel carrots and then hand them out to the coders.","The birthplace of Ethereum is one reason why Zug is \u201Cliterally the crypto cradle,\u201D said Alexander E. Brunner, a former member of Zurich\u2019s parliament and author of the book \u201CCrypto Nation Switzerland.\u201D","Another reason is the Swiss government. \u201CYou can deny it or you can face it,\u201D Dolfi Müller, the former mayor of Zug once said of the emergence of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. \u201CWe always said we have to face it, because these things are coming if we want or not.\u201D","Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart","So Zug faced it, working proactively to brand the region as \u201CCrypto Valley,\u201D their answer to Silicon Valley. For example, the government experimented with allowing citizens to pay their taxes with bitcoin. Then there was the clear regulatory framework. \u201CSwitzerland was the first country to have a guideline,\u201D said Brunner.","Whereas regulatory limbo \u2013 or what some call \u201COperation Choke Point 2.0\u201D \u2013 has soured crypto companies on making a home in the United States, in Switzerland you know precisely what you\u2019re going to get, and they make it easy for you. There are even local \u201Ccrypto banks\u201D like SEBA and Sygnum, which provide crypto start-ups the basics like tax statements, coin storage and deposit insurance, said Brunner. (Rarer to find elsewhere in the world.)","This crypto-cozy environment is why the Ethereum Foundation, Cardano, Cosmos and hundreds of other projects came to Zug. Taxes are low, there\u2019s fintech everywhere, Zurich University has a strong blockchain center, and the Zug government just pledged 39 million Swiss francs (~$43.7 million in USD) towards a blockchain research center.","Although there\u2019s one bit of nuance: Zug itself isn\u2019t packed with bars and crypto bros. It\u2019s a small city. The population is less than 30,000 and as Brunner said with surprising bluntness, \u201CIt\u2019s boring.\u201D This is why, realistically, the idea of Zug as a crypto \u201Chub\u201D also factors in the larger cities of Zurich (only a 20-minute train ride away) and Bern and Geneva. \u201CIt has sort of spread across all of Switzerland,\u201D said Brunner.","And while Zug might be a convenient place to legally park your company, it\u2019s not always \u2013 or even usually \u2013 where you pay people to do the actual work. Switzerland is one of the few places on the planet that makes New York City feel cheap. \u201CA lot of the developer talent doesn\u2019t live in Switzerland,\u201D said Brunner. \u201CIf you\u2019re looking for the developer or coding community, Switzerland is not the place to be.\u201D","Then again, it is very much the place to be if you want regulatory clarity, easy access to banks and VCs or just a relaxing dose of Swiss tranquility. Zug is almost cartoonishly pleasant. I spent a month in Zug in 2019, taking jogs by the lake and basking in the clean serenity. I went to a crypto meet-up in the CV Labs, billed as \u201Cthe heartbeat of Crypto Valley,\u201D a gleaming, five-story coworking space \u2013 focused on Web3, of course \u2013 that had, on its top level, floor-to-ceiling windows with imperial views of the Swiss alps.","But the vibe of these meet-ups have changed. Hoodies are out, suits are in. When Brunner went to crypto meetups a few years ago, people would say things like, \u201CBitcoin is going to kill the banks! We\u2019re going to create a better financial system!\u201D","You rarely hear that anymore in Zug crypto meet-ups. Instead, there\u2019s a newfound appreciation for regulatory compliance, licenses and even partnership with the banks. \u201CThe more fringe side of crypto has kind of moved away,\u201D said Brunner. Some might bristle at the loss of crypto\u2019s wilder side, but the way Brunner sees it, \u201CCrypto is growing up, in Switzerland.\u201D","Edited by Jeanhee Kim and Daniel Kuhn."],"entity":[{"type":"$43.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"New York City","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"SEBA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Switzerland","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dolfi Müller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zurich University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bern","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u201CCrypto Valley","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"35%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Zurich","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Work Smart","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Crypto Valley","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Alexander E.
