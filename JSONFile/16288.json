While Helium maintains the network, it\u2019s peer-to-peer, meaning it\u2019s created by individuals owning and operating their own nodes.","","","Enter the Helium hotspot. For over a year, individuals have been able to buy and deploy one of the bologna-sandwich-sized hotspots, which both acts as a node in the network (via low-bandwidth wireless tech called LongFi) and rewards the owner by mining HNT crypto tokens.","","","Read more: Crypto-Powered IoT Networks Are on Their Way to Over 250 US Cities","","","Until now, the only way to get a hotspot was to buy one from Helium for $495 apiece. The RAK Hotspot Miner, available today in North America and coming \u201Csoon\u201D to Europe and Asia, costs $249, or roughly half. It\u2019ll be sold exclusively through Cal-Chip, an online vendor of IoT devices. The components are nearly identical to Helium\u2019s model, according to the company, but RAK can offer a lower price since it can take advantage of economies of scale that Helium can\u2019t.","","","\u201CThis is the first of what we hope will be many third parties building compatible hardware,\u201D Helium CEO Amir Haleem said in an interview. \u201CIt\u2019s an enormous step for us because up until now, we\u2019ve been the only manufacturer and we\u2019ve been the bottleneck. We can\u2019t be the only entity contributing to [the network], both from a price point of view but also it doesn\u2019t speak well to the decentralization story.\u201D","","","The buyers of Helium\u2019s hotspots have typically been enthusiasts who see the value in a low-power network or companies that want to leverage the technology itself. ","","","A company that wants to use the network to, say, track the location of its rental scooters can exchange HNT for data credits, which Helium also manages, and have a fixed price in dollars. The more hotspots in an area, the better the tracking \u2013 which also would likely fuel demand for HNT, which was trading at $1.75 as of press time, according to Messari.","","","You can see where this is going. With the RAK Hotspot lowering the bar to entry, more Helium owners may start to purchase them just to mine the cryptocurrency. If that happens, and those people are spread out in enough different places, Helium\u2019s dream of decentralized wireless (which it calls, with a straight face, \u201CDeWi\u201D) might start to solidify, turning all those hotspots into valuable investments.","","","\u201CBuilding wireless infrastructure this way and having access to the internet be decentralized and not controlled by one entity is a must-have step in the evolution of the internet,\u201D said Haleem. The existing universe of low-power access points and gateways is, quite frankly, a clusterf**k. So it's great to have a third party start to get involved in the foundational infrastructure.\u201D","","","Read more: IoT App Nodle Moves From Stellar Blockchain to Polkadot","","","Helium\u2019s technology is promising, but far from ubiquitous. The company says it\u2019s sold about 12,000 hotspots, although public network stats say only 8,641 are active. And while that still sounds like a lot, it takes between 100-200 hotspots to bring a single city \u201Conline.\u201D ","","","A few well-known companies, including Lime and Salesforce, have used Helium\u2019s tech, but it\u2019s early days.","","","In short, Helium needs to rise a lot further to reach its decentralized wireless utopia in the clouds, and its bubble could pop anytime. But at least with RAK Wireless coming on board, the weight of that journey is a little lighter.",""],"entity":[{"type":"$249","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"RAK Hotspot Miner","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"North America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Amir Haleem","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cal","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Haleem","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"IoT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"RAK Wireless","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"US Cities","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"RAK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Internet of Things (IoT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.75","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Polkadot","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$495","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"IoT App Nodle Moves From Stellar Blockchain","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Blockchain","Internet of Things","Helium","HNT"],"authors":["Pete Pachal"]}
