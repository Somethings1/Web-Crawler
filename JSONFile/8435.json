However, Polygon is its most active, accounting for over $800 million in monthly average trading volume. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygon\u2019s Growing DeFi Ecosystem<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygon has a robust DeFi ecosystem with more than 7,000 decentralized applications (dApps) deployed on its network, including major DeFi players such as Aave, Curve, and Uniswap. The network offers a wide range of secure, fast, affordable and energy-efficient Ethereum scaling and infrastructure solutions for dApps\u2014one of the reasons SynFutures co-founder and CEO Rachel Lin credits with SynFutures\u2019 early decision to deploy on Polygon. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe initially deployed on Ethereum but the barriers to trading on the network were too large to ignore, namely, cost and speed.

Today, more than 26,000 users have made trades on Polygon, and 80-plus Polygon assets have been listed on SynFutures.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSynFutures\u2019 user-friendly platform combined with Polygon\u2019s scalability and low fees was really a game changer for not only our ecosystem but anyone who wants to get into derivatives trading,'' Lin added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SynFutures has two key features that separate it from other DeFi derivatives exchanges. Traders can list any futures pair in just a few clicks, supporting any asset with a price feed from cryptocurrencies and traditional equities to gold, indices, or any other real-world asset. To enable permissionless listings, SynFutures takes an approach similar to Uniswap V3, allowing anyone to list and provide liquidity to new pairs. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The platform also offers a highly-intuitive user experience with a clean and minimal user interface that makes it easy for new retail traders to explore derivatives. SynFutures\u2019 sAMM model also enables single token liquidity, allowing liquidity providers to provide liquidity to pairs using a single token. <\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Driving Adoption with Long-tail Assets<\/b>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A main focus for SynFutures is addressing the unmet demand for long-tail assets, which is a significant driver of growth in the derivatives market. As it expands its products and listings, the derivatives DEX is committed to its growth on Polygon but also expanding its multi-chain strategy to create a more robust derivatives market that supports assets across all networks. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CDerivatives play an important role in any healthy financial market.
