This fragmentation of liquidity makes the ecosystem less efficient, Tapio Protocol argues, and it aims to put the proceeds of its latest raise towards solving the problem.","In order to unify DOT derivatives into a single asset, Tapio Protocol has come up with tDOT \u2014 which can already be found on Acala, a Polkadot DeFi hub. It is backed by a stable swap liquidity pool comprised of both DOT and DOT derivatives.","Polkadot was one of the hotter projects last year, but news surrounding the Ethereum competitor has slowed since then. Nevertheless, development activity on the project remains high, according to its GitHub repository, as <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/polkadot-hits-all-time-high-in-development-activity\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">relayed<\/a> by CoinTelegraph.","Â© 2023 The Block.
