He and a group of half a dozen investors have poured tens of millions of dollars into the venture, he says, without giving an exact figure. The money has been spent on purchasing equipment and for colocation space.","\u201CThere\u2019s a lot of investor interest in this, I\u2019m definitely holding back capital at this stage,\u201D says Faes.","Faes set up property lending platform LendInvest in 2008 and ran it as CEO until January 2020, when he took the role of executive chair. In July of last year, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.altfi.com\/article\/8094_lendinvest-confirms-filing-for-40m-london-ipo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">went public<\/a> on AIM, a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange, at a valuation of £255.6 million. It has lent more than £4 billion to property developers and landlords in the United Kingdom, according to its website. &nbsp;","Faes began exploring setting up a crypto mining company in early 2021, after London-listed Argo Blockchain caught his eye.","\u201CI saw some similarities to LendInvest back in 2008, where there was a pretty good opportunity to get returns but few institutions in the space,\u201D he says.","Building out what he calls a pilot version of the business has not been straightforward, however. Competition for the latest mining machines (ASICs) and for rack space within colocation sites is high. \u201CThere\u2019s a lot of shysters in the sector,\u201D says Faes.","The environmental concerns that have dogged crypto mining are another challenge. Earlier this week, a top regulator at the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/130763\/esma-vice-chair-calls-for-proof-of-work-mining-ban?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">called for a ban<\/a> on proof-of-work mining within the bloc because of how energy intensive it is. Outright mining bans have already been instigated in China and Kosovo.","Given the political headwinds in Europe, Faes has chosen to base his operation in Texas. He plans to draw entirely on renewable energy sources \u2014 a mix of solar, wind and hydroelectricity. The machines Faes already has up and running elsewhere in the US are roughly 75% powered by renewable energy, he says.","Texas has proven a popular choice for crypto miners. Argo Blockchain is currently in the process of building out a site in Dickens County that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/123386\/argo-filing-reveals-texas-mining-facility-could-cost-up-to-2-billion-to-build\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">could cost<\/a> as much as $2 billion.","\u201CIn Texas, I think the political environment is quite pro-mining,\u201D says Faes. \u201CIt's kind of the centre of the universe in the space, which is a double edged sword because it is quite competitive.\u201D &nbsp;","He is hoping the mining business is fully operational by year-end."],"hashtag":[]}
