This week U.S. prosecutors continued to urge a federal judge to end Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s house arrest and jail the failed crypto mogul until his criminal trial can begin on Oct. 2.","The government has accused Bankman-Fried of illicit tampering with witnesses in his criminal case on multiple occasions, the latest being talking to the Times for their profile of Ellison, who is also his ex-girlfriend. In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243141\/sbf-doj-incarceration-free-speech\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a letter<\/a> submitted late Aug. 3 to the court where Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial will take place, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said that Ellison will be \u201Can important witness\u201D in the trial, and argues that Bankman-Fried is trying to discredit her.","Responding to claims from the FTX owner\u2019s defense lawyers that Ellison was already the subject of media coverage, Williams says that Bankman-Fried helped put her in the center of press attention, as part of his, \u201Csustained effort to focus the media on Ellison\u2019s personal life and private writings.\u201D","Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys argued that a New York Times reporter was already working on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/07\/20\/technology\/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the story<\/a> around Ellison\u2019s writings that kicked off the latest legal fight over whether or not the criminally-indicted former crypto billionaire should remain under house arrest before his October trial.","But Williams replied that Bankman-Fried, \u201Cshared materials with the press obviously designed to intimidate, harass, and embarrass someone he knows is slated to testify against him, and to provoke an emotional response in potential jurors and color a potential juror\u2019s view of that witness.\u201D","Following last week\u2019s Times article about Ellison\u2019s writings, prosecutors pressed for an end to Bankman-Fried\u2019s house arrest with his parents. Judge Lewis Kaplan, the U.S. district court judge presiding over the case, issued a temporary gag order on Bankman-Fried and others involved in the case, which the New York Times and other media organizations are now fighting.","In his Aug. 3 letter to the court, Williams repeats accusations that Bankman-Fried improperly reached out to FTX US General Counsel Ryne Miller months ago in an attempt to coerce Miller\u2019s testimony to corroborate Bankman-Fried\u2019s own story, through contact using an encrypted messaging app.","In a message entered into the record by Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys, the former FTX CEO messaged Miller via multiple mediums apologizing for being on the \u201Cwrong foot\u201D with one another and asking to \u201Creconnect and see if there\u2019s a way to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other.\u201D","Miller is generally referred to as \u2018Witness-1\u2019 throughout Bankman-Fried\u2019s court filing, but identifiable by his email signature in one exchange, in which he directed Bankman-Fried towards the corporate restructuring expert put in charge of FTX, John Ray III, and lawyers tasked with maximizing value from the imploded business empire for creditors.","As a result of the repeated outreach to \u201Cvet things with each other\u201D, as well as use of a virtual private network which Bankman-Fried said was necessary to watch American football games that are publicly broadcast over-air for free, Bankman-Fried\u2019s bail terms were tightened earlier this year. His use of electronics must be monitored and limited, and a thus-far non-public log of visitors to the home must be kept, though at least one journalist has asked the court to make the list public.","Williams continued to push Kaplan to jail Bankman-Fried and cut him off from press contact prior to trial due to the allegations of witness tampering. But Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys, the Times, and famed Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe argued to Kaplan this week that presenting his case in the press was part of his constitutional right to free speech.","In an Aug. 1 filing presenting an affidavit from Tribe, Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys wrote that, \u201Ccriminal defendants have a right to talk to the press about their case to influence their public image and try to protect their reputation, as long as the communications are not calculated to pervert the course of justice.\u201D","The judge, Kaplan, issued a temporary gag order on Bankman-Fried, lawyers, and other people involved in the case until he makes a determination about whether to order Bankman-Fried to jail prior to the trial.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">UPDATE: With additional details of arguments around Bankman-Fried's bail and gag order throughout. <\/em>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
