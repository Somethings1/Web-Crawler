And if the process plays out as Coinbase seems to think it will, with the SEC refusing to make a specific rule, Coinbase could appeal in court but may not win.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe SEC has never lost a single one of those cases,\u201D Stark said, referring to the over 100 cases brought against crypto projects.
