Last year, Japan\u2019s courts changed Mt Gox\u2019s case status from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation, which allowed the company to restructure its business and might possibly lead to creditors getting some of their assets back. Mt Gox currently holds 141,868 bitcoin on behalf of creditors, which constitute 15% of the 940,000 bitcoin originally lost, according to the latest report available on its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mtgox.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">website<\/a>.","In a letter penned by Fortress managing director Michael Hourigan, the firm proposed to acquire creditors\u2019 bitcoins held by Mt Gox at bitcoin\u2019s current market price. At last check, bitcoin was trading at $7,200 a coin. That would provide creditors with a guaranteed payment, but Fortress would pocket 30% of what they could have been paid.&nbsp;","The letter cites the ongoing lawsuits filed by two large creditors, Mt Gox\u2019s parent company Tibannee and U.S.-based bitcoin business incubator CoinLab, as a reason why creditors should sell. \u201CThese lawsuits threaten to delay and dilute distributions on your claim,\u201D the letter says. Creditors have until Dec. 31 to make their decision.","According to an October <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mtgox.com\/img\/pdf\/20191001_report.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a> by Tokyo District Court, a total of 56 Mt Gox\u2019s creditors have filed petitions for claim assessment. In recent months, the court has approved Tibannee\u2019s claim concerning over 82,000 bitcoins and $386 million Japanese yen (around $3.5 million) as well as CoinLab\u2019s claim concerning $385 million Japanese yen (around $3.5 million) and delay damages.","The legal process will likely drag on for a long time and Fortress hopes creditors will sell to them instead.This is the second time Fortress has offered Mt Gox creditors a deal. In July, the firm offered $900 per bitcoin, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/fortress-will-buy-mt-gox-creditors-claims-for-900-per-bitcoin-owed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinDesk<\/a> reported at the time.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":[]}
