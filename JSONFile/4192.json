That complaint alleged that PassionForest, an \u201Conline artificial flower vendor,\u201D was in fact a straw donor used to illegally funnel $500,000 from an unidentified source into a Super PAC backing Suarez.","The entity was incorporated in Delaware in 2021 and has little online presence beyond an Amazon storefront listing a Chinese business address, according to the complaint.","\u201CPublicly available information suggests that PassionForest\u2019s artificial flower business had largely shuttered within eleven months and that the LLC therefore could not have made a $500,000 contribution without money being provided to it for that purpose,\u201D it added.","The PAC added a memo to a filing on Monday and listed Soto-Wright as the CEO of PassionForest, the Miami Herald said. A spokesperson for Soto-Wright denied any wrongdoing and told the paper that the CEO personally donated the funds through the LLC that has no affiliation with the Chinese flower vendor of the same name.&nbsp;","The spokesperson called the complaint \"typical politics,\" likely being used by an opposing campaign to \"tie Suarez up in several negative news cycles.\"","\u201CIvan Soto-Wright made a personal contribution consistent with federal campaign finance laws,\u201D Samuel Brown, a partner at law firm Holland &amp; Knight that was used by Soto-Wright to file the contribution, told the Miami Herald.&nbsp;","SOS America and Suarez\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Herald. The FEC told the paper that it doesn't comment on complaints or potential investigations.","MoonPay didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment from The Block.","Suarez, a Republican, is a longstanding crypto advocate who has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-05-24\/miami-mayor-suarez-tells-davos-he-still-takes-salary-in-bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">taken his city salary in bitcoin<\/a>.
