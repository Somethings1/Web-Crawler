Ripple said in its statement the stablecoin market, now worth more than $150 billion, is expected to surge to $2.8 trillion by 2028.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/stablecoins\/usd-pegged\/total-stablecoin-supply\/embed\" title=\"Total Stablecoin Supply\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz told The Block that \"in retrospect\" he and his team would have liked to launch a stablecoin sooner. However, after learning more about the market and monitoring economic factors, he said, issuing one this year makes strategic sense.","\"The interest rate increase makes it a much more attractive market,\" he said. \"Also there's kind of been a shakeup, and really, Tether is almost a no-go for us because of the regulatory issues. There's just so much uncertainty around it.\"","He went on to say: \"We've used USDC before [and] there's nothing wrong with it. It's just, you don't want to have only one option.\"","In the case of USDT, the largest stablecoin by supply, JPMorgan analysts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/277655\/jpmorgan-tether-ofac-comments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recently predicted<\/a> its use is likely to decline amid upcoming stablecoin regulations. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has suggested JPMorgan's analysis is the result of its jealousy concerning USDT's dominant position among stablecoins. USDT makes up about $110 billion of the more than $150 billion stablecoin market supply, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/stablecoins\/usd-pegged\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block Data Dashboard<\/a>.","While Schwartz said Ripple would \"love\" to usurp Tether's dominance, he sees room in the market for multiple options \"particularly in DeFi applications where concentrated risk is a huge problem.\"","Schwartz said Ripple believes both the company's customers and the global market will respond positively if there is a stablecoin that organizations can feel more secure using, specifically one on the XRP Ledger. \"There's a lot of great assets on the XRP Ledger, but not really a good stablecoin, and even if you had one, you don't want to build a business around a single option,\" he said.","When asked about specific use cases, Schwartz said he believes the new stablecoin should be attractive to small- and medium-sized enterprises and non-banking financial institutions like payment companies.","\"I really hope we can drive enterprise-grade institutional adoption of the stablecoin, which I think has been a little bit lacking both because of regulatory issues and the lack of someone to package something together as a product,\" added Schwartz. \"We'll have a leg up because of our compliance.\"","Like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/165513\/tether-says-its-not-freezing-tornado-cash-until-government-tells-it-to\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tether<\/a>, Ripple has faced public scrutiny.
