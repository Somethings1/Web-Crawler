These NFTs can be grouped based on what users desire such as traits, rarity, or even whether they are banned on Opensea.&nbsp;","Sound confusing? Imagine you want to buy a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT that has a solid gold fur trait, a trait shared by just 0.46% of the BAYC collection. Instead of searching and bidding on other marketplaces, you could create a liquidity pool and deposit ETH into it. Someone wishing to sell a solid gold fur Ape would then be able to deposit the Ape into the pool and be paid for it immediately.","Likewise, if you wanted to sell an NFT, you could find a pool that matches the criteria of your NFT and sell it straight away, providing there is enough ETH in the pool.","Collection will launch on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet today before rolling out on the Ethereum mainnet later on in Q1 2023.","\u201CThe difference between the NFT DEXs versus the traditional marketplaces like OpenSea is that you can automatically buy and sell,\u201D said Spencer Yang, core contributor for Collection.xyz &amp; CEO of Gomu. \u201CWe believe that NFT DEX infrastructure is essential for the growth of the NFT industry in all market conditions.\u201D","Based in Singapore, Gomu launched early last year and raised a $5 million seed funding round in October from investors including Coinbase Ventures, Defiance Capital, and Saison Capital. In November, it announced Mutant Hideout, an NFT marketplace and community hub for members holding Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
