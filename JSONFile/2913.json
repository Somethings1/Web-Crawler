With an overabundance of projects out there, many are looking to add value to their token holders and experimenting with how they can do so. One way is to give back a portion of the fees generated when NFTs are bought and sold on marketplaces to token holders \u2014 known as royalties. The idea is that this should incentivize buyers to hold for the long term. But marketplaces are concerned that this could make the JPEGs fall foul of U.S. securities laws.","FTX.US president Brett Harrison said, \u201CWe will list NFT projects that pay royalties to the artists\/creators, but we can\u2019t list those projects which distribute the royalties from collection sales to NFT holders. A token which guarantees you a percentage income stream from the sales of a pool of assets starts to look like a security.\u201D","Ethereum-focused NFT marketplace OpenSea has similar concerns. Its <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/tos\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">terms and conditions<\/a> identify a range of types of NFTs that might be unsuitable for its platform, including those that can be redeemable for financial instruments and ones that \u201Centitle owners to financial rewards.\u201D&nbsp;","Last week, these concerns led OpenSea to stop the buying and selling of the Turtle DAO NFT collection \u2014 which awards tokens to NFT holders \u2014 although it didn\u2019t state which specific term the project violated."],"hashtag":[]}
