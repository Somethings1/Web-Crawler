That program has been the subject of a public feud between Gemini\u2019s Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and the head of Genesis\u2019 Digital Currency Group, Barry Silbert. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt creates a warning signal for other exchanges and actors in the crypto space that are also offering yield bearing products, which is quite frankly a lot of the exchanges,\u201D said Alex More, a partner at Carrington, Coleman, Sloman &amp; Blumenthal who focuses on digital assets. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gemini ended the Gemini Earn program earlier this month. Retail investors in Gemini Earn have not been able to withdraw their assets, the SEC said on Thursday. Those charges last week and others make clear that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with securities laws, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We look forward to defending ourselves against this manufactured parking ticket.

Prior to its bankruptcy filing, BlockFi settled with the agency in February for $100 million and said it would cease its unregistered offers and sales of its lending product.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span>","Zachary Fallon, partner at Ketsal, a law firm that specializes in fintech and digital asset industries, said the SEC\u2019s move last week is another warning for crypto companies interested in lending and yield products.","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe SEC\u2019s action this week against Gemini and Genesis is nothing new, and it\u2019s in line with some of its previous actions in the industry, including with BlockFi,\u201D Fallon said in an emailed statement. \u201CThat said, the business of crypto-focused lending among institutions will likely continue, but this most recent action should disabuse market participants of any notion that retail-focused crypto lending products can be offered in the United States without compliance with the securities laws.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Other exchanges have tried to move forward with a lending product. Crypto exchange Coinbase had plans to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/118091\/coinbase-drops-plans-for-crypto-lending-product-after-sec-tussle\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launch<\/span><\/a> its own crypto lending product, but dropped that in September 2021 in light of the SEC\u2019s view that it would constitute a security. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CPlatforms that offer these sort of programs are going to be continually targeted for them and they need to make a correct legal and risk assessment if they\u2019re going to offer them,\u201D said Christopher LaVigne, head of U.S. litigation at law firm Withers and co-chair of Withers' Global Digital Assets Practice.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Piwowar thought it notable that the SEC made no allegations concerning whether the underlying crypto in this case are securities. But he added that the agency could still make those allegations in other cases.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt ju<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">st means they feel they don\u2019t need to make those arguments for this case,\u201D Piwowar said. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LaVigne also said the action is a reminder that they agency has a broad view that nearly everything in the crypto sector should be subject to its regulatory regime. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThey want to be the main regulator,\u201D he said. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
