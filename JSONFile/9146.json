Alegre will officially start in the first half of 2023.&nbsp;","Activision Blizzard is known for developing blockbuster games such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. Alegre had been in the seat since early 2020. The business is currently being acquired by Microsoft for $68.7 billion, pending regulatory approval. The deal was expected to close as early as 2023 but recently hit a bump in the road when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission formally opposed it.&nbsp;","The hire puts a firm stake in the ground for Yuga Labs' gaming ambitions as it prepares for additional tests of its Otherside 'metaverse' \u2014 the multiplayer web3 game it is developing for Bored Ape Yacht Club faithful. Yuga has previously outlined ambitions to become the Disney of web3.&nbsp;","\u201CThe company\u2019s pipeline of products, partnerships, and IP represents a massive opportunity to define the metaverse in a way that empowers creators and provides users with true ownership of their identity and digital assets,\" said Alegre.","Alegre has also spent 16 years in leadership roles at Google (President of Global Retail and Shopping, President of Global and Strategic Partnerships, and President of Asia-Pacific and Japan).","\"The move reinforces the notion that Yuga is doubling down on becoming the backbone of web3 gaming,\" said Thomas Bialek, a research analyst focussing on NFTs at The Block Research. \"Under the new leadership, efforts to proliferate the lifestyle aspects of the brand might take a backseat for now as gaming endeavors become the primary focus.\"","Yuga is the latest NFT brand to bring in a CEO outside of crypto to lead its expansion ambitions.
