This is even the case, believe it or not, for Wall Street.&nbsp;","From the Ghana funeral that's swept financial services Twitter (FinTwit) following Ray Dalio's \"cash is trash\" call to the much-loved \"Money printer go brr,\" this crisis has seen its fair share of memes. Indeed, it's fueled engagement for meme accounts, such as Ramp Capital, the anonymous, self-declared CFO of FinTwit.","An engineer by trade, the man behind the Ramp Capital account has been tweeting about the financial services world since 2013, bringing a degree of humility to an ecosystem long known for its buttoned-up style. He's ramped things up, pun intended, since global markets began gyrating in February.","On this episode of The Scoop, The Block's Frank Chaparro and Ryan Todd talk to Ramp about memeing through the crisis and its wild stock market swings, Ramp's crowdsourced stock portfolio \u2013 $WERAMP \u2013 and Ramp's observations on the key difference between market sentiment and Twitter sentiment.","Â© 2023 The Block.
