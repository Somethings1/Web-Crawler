One person with knowledge of the situation told The Block that Tokarev owns a little over 40% of the business. This chimes with an analysis of corporate filings, which suggest he owns 76,487,000 ordinary shares out of a total 189,129,188 total shares in the company, equating to a stake of 40.4%.","There is likely to be some dilution in the upcoming raise, but not enough to keep Tokarev from acceding to billionaire status, according to the same source.","Another person with direct knowledge of the matter said the fundraise will also make paper millionaires of 30 Copper employees. The startup currently employs around 150 people.&nbsp;","Tokarev\u2019s billion-dollar fortune would only be paper-based, in that he would need to sell shares through a public offering, by selling the business, or through secondary sales in order to realise it. But it nevertheless places him among a select few tech billionaires in Britain.","Another from the fintech sector is Revolut CEO Nikolay Storonsky, who recently <a href=\"https:\/\/sifted.eu\/articles\/revolut-ceo-family-office\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">set up a family office<\/a> to manage a fortune that is estimated to be worth $7 billion. Like Tokarev, Storonsky was born in Russia.","The particulars of Copper\u2019s upcoming $500 million raise \u2014 including the investors and the exact valuation \u2014 are yet to be finalized, but Bloomberg reports that SoftBank, Tiger Global and Accel are participating. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment.","Founded in 2018, Copper helps investors to protect their crypto holdings against cybercrime. Its signature product ClearLoop connects cryptocurrency exchanges together to power instant, offline trade settlements. The startup also offers payment settlement and prime brokerage services.","Copper raised $75 million through an extended Series B round earlier this year.
