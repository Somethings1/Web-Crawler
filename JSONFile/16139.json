{"summary":"When the tech hub of Europe meets a society that prizes financial autonomy, the result is a crypto community that practices the very decentralization it preaches. Case in point: Blockchain Week Berlin, the flagship annual conference of the No. 10 spot in CoinDesk\u2019s Crypto Hubs 2023, is a self-organized, crypto-agnostic community initiative.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/consensus-magazine\/2023\/06\/27\/berlin-the-center-for-decentralized-finance-and-techno-music\/","publishDate":"2023-06-27T11:30:10","id":16139,"type":null,"title":"Berlin: The Center for Decentralized Finance \u2013 and Techno Music","category":["Consensus Magazine"],"content":["Berlin had a strong showing in crypto regulatory structure and crypto adoption, which make up the drivers, the most heavily weighted category in CoinDesk\u2019s rubric. Against this sample of 25 mostly high-performing and economically well-developed hubs, however, the German capital rated solidly in the middle of the pack in the opportunity scores that measure per-capita crypto jobs, companies and events, and enabler scores including ease of doing business and digital infrastructure.","For more on the criteria and how we weighted them, see: How We Ranked CoinDesk\u2019s Crypto Hubs 2023: Our Methodology.","Berlin\u2019s crypto scene may not be as famous as the city\u2019s techno music, nightlife or architecture but its quiet influence on decentralized finance (DeFi) is undeniable. If the city were a painting, several brushstrokes trace the beginnings of Ethereum, with Berlin even playing host to the first ever Ethereum developers\u2019 meetup DEVCON 0 in 2014, just months before the blockchain went live. Kreuzberg district\u2019s Room 77 was the first bar in the world to accept bitcoin (BTC) as payment.","Since those early days of crypto, Germany\u2019s capital \u2013 which was already a tech hub in its own right with Google and Facebook having opened offices in the city \u2013 has been a big draw for the blockchain-inclined, Patrick Hansen, director of EU strategy and policy at stablecoin issuer Circle, said.","Read Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart","Hansen moved to Berlin in 2017 and quickly became an influential voice in blockchain policy in Europe just as Germany emerged as one of the first countries in the world to make a serious go of regulating crypto. He said the city\u2019s crypto scene is \u201Cdecentralized,\u201D aptly reflecting its community favoring source code and core infrastructure over big centralized exchanges or custodians.","\u201CThere's \u2026 the Berlin Blockchain Week, by far the biggest conference, but even that is very decentralized. It's not one main event, but it's like hundreds of events that take place during the same week,\u201D Hansen said. According to its website, \u201CBlockchain Week Berlin is a decentralized community-organized initiative. There is no single owner. It is an agnostic movement based on the premise that self-organization is the backbone of the ecosystem.\u201D","Aside from the flagship event, in Berlin, there is something for any kind of blockchain aficionado (DeFi, CeFi, NFTs \u2013 you name it!) with opportunities for diversity and growth, Santiago Abraham, association manager at BerChain, a member-led nonprofit that supports and promotes Berlin\u2019s crypto community, said.","\u201CThe community is really decentralized,\u201D Abraham echoed Hansen, adding that in any given week, there\u2019s a myriad of blockchain-focused meetups, events and your pick of spaces to work from or hold friendly gatherings over drinks \u2013 called \u201CStammtisch.\u201D","Berlin resident and crypto veteran Julian Grigo said he chose to move to the city because \u201Cit's such a livable, vibrant city, the most international, the most culturally interesting.\u201D For techno music and partying, Berlin is still the place to go, Grigo said. \u201CThis kind of flavor Berlin has is different to many other cities in Europe.\u201D Hansen added that Berlin\u2019s cost of living is still favorable compared to other cities in the region, which are suffering from rising food and energy prices.","For Grigo, Berlin\u2019s crypto scene reflects a broader appreciation in Germany for crypto\u2019s promise of financial security and autonomy. Surveillance under East Germany\u2019s \u201CStasi\u201D secret police during Cold War times is still in the nation\u2019s collective memory, Grigo said. That and a general fear of hyperinflation has left the country\u2019s population somewhat amenable to crypto.","This national sentiment may be one more factor that allows projects that call Berlin home \u2013 from regulated DeFi platforms like Swarm to privacy-preserving portfolio tracking app Rotki \u2013 to thrive, and what helps to draw talented developers from all over the world to Berlin-native conferences like ETHBerlin and Dappcon, organized by GnosisDAO, which builds decentralized infrastructure for Ethereum.","\"Why Berlin and not Munich or Frankfurt? After all those are the German financial centers, right? Frankly ... I don't think this could have happened there,\" Lefteris Karapetsas, the creator of Rotki, said. Karapetsas, who says he was at the Ethereum office on Waldermarstr street in 2015 when the mainnet was launched, added that \"Berlin has the unique combination of talent, crazy, passion, dirty and even ugly stuff that combined together make it the capital of crypto for Europe.\"","Grigo also noted that Germany is only behind the U.S. globally in terms of the number of Bitcoin nodes and Ethereum validators hosted despite having one-fourth of the population.","\u201CI think this is a strong indicator that crypto is very deeply rooted in Germany,\u201D Grigo said. \u201CAnd the heart of the German tech scene, and also its crypto scene, is definitely Berlin.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grigo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u201CBlockchain Week Berlin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Berlin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Hansen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Munich","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Frankfurt","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Germany","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Patrick Hansen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Work Smart","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Stasi","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"East Germany","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Julian Grigo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Berlin Blockchain Week","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lefteris Karapetsas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Rotki","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kreuzberg","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Santiago Abraham","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"the U.S.","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Features","Crypto Hubs 2023","Berlin","DeFi","Decentralized Finance"],"authors":["Sandali Handagama"]}
