But it began to experience a sharper decline after June 9, when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/107707\/xinjiang-bitcoin-miner-shut-crackdown-china\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the Xinjiang government<\/a> issued an order to officials in the Zhundong economic development zone to cut energy supplies to \"virtual currency mining farms.\"&nbsp;","The Sichuan government followed Xinjiang's lead and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/108916\/sichuan-orders-state-power-grid-to-cut-supply-for-26-bitcoin-mining-farms\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued a similar order on June 18<\/a>. This led to the majority of the mining farms in the top two mining regions to suspend their operations.","Ethereum's network hash rate has now dropped below the 500 TH\/s level, which translates to a 20% decline.","In comparison, Bitcoin's total hash rate has dropped below 100 exahashes per second, down <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/109315\/bitcoin-hashrate-declines-50-percent-china-mining-crackdown\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">nearly 50%<\/a> from its recent all-time-high.","Meanwhile, the hashing power connected to Hangzhou-based Sparkpool \u2014 once the biggest Ethereum mining pool by real-time hash rate \u2014 has declined from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wsfoxley\/status\/1407410159429685249?s=12\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">around 150 TH\/s a little over a week ago<\/a> to right now 85 TH\/s.&nbsp;","Further, Poolin, a major bitcoin mining pool based in China that also offers Ethereum mining, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/109600\/poolin-halt-btc-eth-hash-rate-token-china-crackdown\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">halted mining payouts<\/a> to users who have staked its bitcoin or Ethereum hash rate tokens. The firm said its proprietary Bitcoin and Ethereum mining operations in China have been crippled by the government's recent shutdown orders.","The pullback of the crypto market in recent weeks together with the shutdown orders in China affecting both bitcoin and Ethereum miners have also led to the cool down of the secondhand market of the graphic unit processors.","Data from Chinese mobile app Manmanbuy, which tracks historic prices of various electronic gadgets, shows that different models of GPUs have seen a price drop by between 20% to 50% over the past month.","Â© 2023 The Block.
