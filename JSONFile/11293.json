River did not disclose a valuation. It last raised capital in March 2021, when it secured $12 million in a round led by Goldcrest.","Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, River offers a range of Bitcoin-related services, including a brokerage with zero-fee recurring orders, custody, mining and a wallet that supports on-chain and Lightning Network transactions. It also has an enterprise API that helps companies plug into the Lightning Network \u2014 a service relied on by El Salvador\u2019s Chivo Wallet, among others.","\u201CWe\u2019re seeing another wave of Bitcoin interest, largely driven by business and institutional adoption,\u201D Alex Leishman, River\u2019s CEO, said in the statement. \u201CIt\u2019s not hype this time. This year\u2019s bank failures and bailouts have been a wake-up call, revealing the cracks of the traditional financial system and reminding us why Bitcoin is so important \u2014 it\u2019s a secure path to a stronger and more transparent global economy.\u201D","A string of bank crises in the U.S. earlier this year \u2014 among them the collapse of crypto-friendly outfits like Signature Bank, Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank \u2014 has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/228317\/bitcoin-price-crypto-market-first-republic-outflows\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">contributed to a resurgence<\/a> in the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin has risen from $16,500 at the start of the year to around $27,000 today, according to CoinGecko data.","River today employs 45 people full-time. The startup plans to use the funding injection to expand its consumer offering, as well as its Bitcoin banking solutions, Leishman said in an email. It will also continue to invest in its mining and Lightning infrastructure products.","\u201CBy focusing on Bitcoin, we are able to go deep into things like mining and Lightning that multi-coin crypto companies cannot,\u201D he added.","Â© 2023 The Block.
