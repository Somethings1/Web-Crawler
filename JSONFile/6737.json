The project aims to cut out the fees charged by centralized platforms in the NFT space.&nbsp;","\u201CSomeone like OpenSea, they\u2019re going to take a cut, and that\u2019s because they provide additional services on top of that decentralization,\u201D said Jeffries. \u201CWe control nothing. We set up the ecosystem to empower others.\u201D","Since June this year, Metaplex has supported more than $385 million in NFT sales. There are 1,800 developer teams building tools on the protocol, according to the press release.","The studio aims to boost the Metaplex protocol\u2019s community, steer the development of new tools and making them available on an open-source basis.","\u201CThe structure right now is there are two arms to it \u2013 the foundation and studios. The foundation\u2019s job is essentially the goal of growing the ecosystem, handling grants, setting up advisors and dealing with fundraising,\u201D said Jeffries. Metaplex Studios, on the other hand, will act as \u201Cevangelists\u201D for the protocol, he added.","One of the studio\u2019s main selling points is the fact that Metaplex runs on Solana, a proof-of-stake blockchain that has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/114703\/solana-hits-all-time-high-as-market-watchers-say-institutional-interest-is-growing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">experienced tremendous growth<\/a> in recent months.","Most NFT projects run on Ethereum, but heavy congestion and spiralling transaction costs on the network have proven difficult for smaller, lower-priced collections to navigate. \u201CRunning on Solana has the benefit of very, very low transaction costs as well as high speeds,\u201D said Jeffries. &nbsp;","But he added that different blockchains have different purposes and that porting assets between them, in the future, will boost the entire ecosystem.","\u201CMaybe you have a super, super high value NFT and your client just feels more comfortable being on Ethereum, you bridge and you send it over,\u201D he explained.","Â© 2023 The Block.
