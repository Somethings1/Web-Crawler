The Bahamian entity still controls at least hundreds of millions of dollars-worth of assets.&nbsp;","\u201CIf the FTX debtors succeed in this adversary proceeding, there will be no property of FTX DM for local proceedings in The Bahamas to resolve,\u201D the filing says.","A lawyer for the joint provisional liquidators did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;","The plaintiffs in the adversary proceeding include FTX.US, the exchange\u2019s sibling trading firm Alameda Research and West Realm Shires, Inc., a holding company formed by former FTX head Sam Bankman-Fried.

The FTX debtors handling the bankruptcy in the United States disagree, saying that the liquidators inherited a \u201Ccorporate shell\u201D that they are using to continue a jurisdictional bankruptcy battle. The \u201Cbaseless\u201D ownership claims will harm FTX customers and creditors, lawyers say.","\u201CThe JPLs\u2019 claim to ownership of FTX.com\u2019s property is based largely on constructive, equitable, and other non-documentary arguments that depend upon the false premise that FTX DM was the center of the FTX Group. Nothing could be further from the truth,\u201D the filing says. \u201CThe peculiar history of FTX DM is a classic example of abuse of the corporate form. It was created as a front to facilitate a conspiracy to defraud the debtors\u2019 customers\u2014a conspiracy to which three individuals have already pled guilty.\u201D","Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founders Gary Wang and Nishad Singh have all pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to their time at the bankrupt company.
