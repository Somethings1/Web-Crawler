{"summary":"The California Democrat wants to know what the Silicon Valley tech giant has planned for digital assets, raising the question whether the battered firm is taking another look at blockchain.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/consensus-magazine\/2024\/01\/23\/why-does-maxine-waters-care-about-metas-crypto-patents\/","publishDate":"2024-01-23T20:44:57","id":15459,"type":null,"title":"Why Does Maxine Waters Care About Meta\u2019s Crypto Trademarks?","category":["Consensus Magazine"],"content":["In early 2022, Arun Sundararajan wrote a Harvard Business Review case study about how established brands could utilize non-fungible tokens, aka NFTs, right before the crypto market tanked. In the piece, the Harold Price Professor of Entrepreneurship at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business tried to make sense of the then-crypto craze, mentioning that tech firms like Twitter and Facebook (now X and Meta, respectively) were allowing more user customization through NFT avatars.","This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","\u201CDesigned right, NFTs could build on the expansion of conspicuous consumption seeded by social media, allowing us to showcase our non-digital lives in our digital spaces more expansively and more authentically,\u201D Sundararajan wrote, arguing that NFTs were \u201Cgoing mainstream in 2022.\u201D","Little did Sundararajan know that in just a few short weeks, the bottom would fall out under the entire crypto market, and NFTs would plummet. Meta would soon discontinue NFT functionality on its Instagram and Facebook apps, to refocus on \u201Careas where we can make impact at scale\u201D during its \u201Cyear of efficiency,\u201D after the company's pivot towards the metaverse hit a wall.","This was not the first time Facebook\u2019s crypto plans were foiled. In fact, there could be a whole HBR edition about the pitfalls of established corporations experimenting with crypto based on Facebook\u2019s failed blockchain efforts. Its Libra stablecoin plan, hatched in 2019, envisioned a radical alternative global currency before it was ravished by regulators. Then the company pulled the plug on Diem, a significantly scaled-down stablecoin effort, after putting a significant amount of resources into developing a new blockchain, wallet and programming language.","If there is any company likely to remain arms length from blockchain, even as the market appears to rebound, it\u2019s probably Meta. This isn\u2019t to say Meta, which is as opportunistic as any corporation, will always steer clear. But it\u2019s hard to imagine it advancing crypto adoption much these days. Especially considering Mark Zuckerberg recently announced he\u2019s directing the largest social media\u2019s vast resources towards the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).","See also: Diem: A Dream Deferred? | Opinion","All of this is why it\u2019s odd to hear that Meta is being questioned by Congress about its crypto activities. In a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Javier Olivan, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) expressed concerns over a couple of blockchain-related trademarks the company filed. Stranger still, the trademark applications are from 2022. So why did Waters, who led resistance to Libra\/Diem in 2019, send the letter now?","Waters, a ranking member of the powerful Democratic House Financial Services Committee, believes the live trademarks represent Meta\u2019s \u201Ccontinued intention\u201D of expanding its role in the digital assets market. This would belie statements Meta representatives made during a committee meeting last October, that \u201Cthere is no ongoing digital assets work\u201D at the company.","According to Waters, Meta will soon have to respond to the U.S. Patents and Trademark Office \u2014 which sent the company five Notice of Allowance (NOA) documents indicating Meta\u2019s five blockchain trademarks meet registration requirements \u2014 answering whether it intends to use the trademarks. The company has until Feb. 15 to respond to the first of five NOAs it received, and so the timing of Water\u2019s questions seem fair. She essentially wants to know in advance how Meta will answer.","And yet, the letter also has a broader scope \u2014 asking if Meta has any designs on crypto at all. Waters asked specifically about whether Meta has future stablecoin plans or partnerships, is \u201Cplanning to launch a payments platform\u201D and whether \u201CMeta\u2019s technology is enabling cryptocurrency creation, mining, storage, transmission or settlement.\u201D It\u2019s as if any amount of crypto-related R&D at Meta is a matter of national interest.","The broad inquiry might be justified given the broad nature of Meta\u2019s applications, which include ideas for digital asset wallets and hardware, chain validation tech, \u201Cblockchain as a service\u201D advertising and even seemingly a dating app with \u201Ca specific branch tailored for investors.\u201D","See also: Reflecting on Facebook's Hilarious, Well-Deserved Crypto Failure | Opinion","But having a trademark or patent approved doesn\u2019t mean a company will actually put it to work. There are plenty of applications that are filed as a defensive maneuver or even just to create the illusion of progress. In an industry like crypto, which was born out of the larger open-source community, the projects that put an emphasis on intellectual property are often the least exciting.","Waters, being one of the first legislators to speak out against Libra, and knowing the power regulators can wield, must recognize that these trademarks aren\u2019t really an indication of activity. If she was concerned about Meta getting involved in crypto again, it would be far more telling if the company had filed any applications after 2022. But a cursory glance shows it hasn\u2019t.","There is a Straussian reading of Waters\u2019 letter that isn\u2019t asking questions of Meta\u2019s crypto activity, but making a statement to Meta and beyond. Big tech may not be fully on board with crypto again, amid a rising market cycle. But even if it were, it\u2019s being watched.","CORRECTION (JAN. 23, 2024): Clarifies that Meta must respond regarding trademark applications, not patents.
