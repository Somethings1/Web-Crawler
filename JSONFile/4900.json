The analyst added that strong liquidity trends are an important signal to confirm that the current price recovery is sustainable. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/260042\/bitcoin-leads-largest-crypto-funds-inflow-since-july-2022-coinshares-says\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin<\/a> is currently in its third week of a sustained upward trajectory, which began in mid-October.","\"With the potential for more favorable liquidity conditions going forward, I'm excited about the current crypto market prospects,\" Lawant added.","However, YouHodler Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha cautioned against viewing the present liquidity levels as a signal of a sustained period of strength for bitcoin.","\"We noticed an uptick in liquidity in the crypto market but it is not possible to say at the moment if it is the beginning of a new upward trend or just a correction in a few-year-long period of capital outflow from the crypto market,\" Lienkha told The Block, referring to increased capital inflows into the cryptocurrency market and institutional cryptocurrency funds.","In the past month, the market capitalization of bitcoin has increased by $140 billion, while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/260042\/bitcoin-leads-largest-crypto-funds-inflow-since-july-2022-coinshares-says\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin-based funds<\/a> have seen net inflows of almost $410 million in the month-to-date.","\"If we talk about the whole crypto market, I think the current level of liquidity is somewhere close to the April 2023 level. If we talk specifically about bitcoin, it might be at a 1.5-year high but just because of a kind of cannibalizing of the token market due to the steady increase of bitcoin share in the market,\" Lienkha added.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -0.65%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> has traded flat over the past 24 hours.
