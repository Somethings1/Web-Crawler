SUI, as its native token, nosedived 68% in the first five months of trading. This came to a crescendo in October when Sui founders were accused of manipulating token supply, claims they quickly dismissed.","However, Sui soon found its stride after a wave of inscription-related activity. First seen on Bitcoin during its recent NFT phase, inscriptions are a way of recording arbitrary data on the blockchain without the use of smart contracts.","On Dec. 22, Sui produced 13.8 million blocks, with transactions per second (TPS) reaching a peak of 6,000. In contrast to other layers 1s, like Ethereum, gas prices during this high traffic phase decreased, according to a Sui blog post. According to Suiexplorer, there are currently 106 validators operating 413 nodes to secure the Sui blockchain.","This buoyed the confidence of developers and investors as both the SUI token price and on-chain TVL increased in the following weeks. The two largest protocols on Sui are Scallop Lend and Navi Protocol, two lending platforms that have both seen TVL quadruple since the turn of the year.","SUI is currently trading at $1.80, having risen by 131% since Jan. 1, outperforming the CoinDesk 20 index, which is up by 10% in the same period.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"Dec. 22","content":"DATE"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$593 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sui","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sui","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sui","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Navi Protocol","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.80","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Aptos","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"131%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$211 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$310 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"68%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Jan. 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Sui","Blockchain","Aptos","Meta"],"authors":["Oliver Knight"]}
