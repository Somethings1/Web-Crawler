The Omni Network will collaborate with major rollup partners like Arbitrum, Polygon's zkEVM, Scroll, ConsenSys's Linea, and Starkware to launch the first version of the platform in the coming year.","The Omni platform is being designed to build on top of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/208015\/eigenlayer-series-a-round\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EigenLayer<\/a>, another blockchain protocol. Omni will leverage EigenLayer for its security needs.","Recursive (previously called Rift) raised $18 million from investors like Pantera and Two Sigma in 2022. Prior to that Recursive co-founder Austin King had co-founded Strata Labs, a crypto payments project that was later acquired by Xpring, the investment arm of Ripple, in 2019.","Â© 2023 The Block.
