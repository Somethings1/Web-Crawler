There has been an explosion of interest in the bot ever since its creator OpenAI released it for free, with developers exploring to what extent they can rely on it.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While Buterin<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/vitalik.eth.limo\/general\/2022\/12\/06\/gpt3.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in a blog post that the new chatbot could be a \u201Cprogramming aid,\u201D it made several mistakes when asked for specific code snippets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAt this point, AI is quite far from being a substitute for human programmers,\u201D Buterin said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ChatGPT uses natural language processing, a type of advanced artificial intelligence, to respond in real-time. Among many of its use cases, ChatGPT can also be employed to look up certain code that can help developers write applications whether specific to blockchains or other types of software.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"In a lot of cases, it can succeed and write some pretty good code especially for common tasks,\" Buterin said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While ChatGPT may be an efficient way for developers to find answers to questions, it\u2019s possible that incorrect code can be provided. So, it's important for developers to be careful.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThat said, it did introduce me to some coding patterns I had not seen before, and it wrote the base converter faster than I would have on my own,\u201D Buterin said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Usually, developers rely on websites like StackOverflow to manually look up ready-to-use code, but that process can take time.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nOther blockchain developers agree with Buterin's conclusion. \u201CI think [ChatGPT] will certainly be helpful in reducing the amount of time spent searching StackOverflow,\u201D Rooter, the founder of Solana-based lending protocol Solend, told The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, Rooter cautioned against the authenticity of code if used in blockchain apps. Given blockchain code is immutable and cannot be changed after it\u2019s in production, developers need to be careful, he added.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
