This is in contrast with more traditional crypto exchanges, which facilitate trading between buyers and sellers.&nbsp;","Customer funds are all accounted for, according to the post, and Youssef encouraged users to withdraw them, recommending self-custody options. Paxful is also offering \"easy migration\" to other options for non-U.S. users, to platforms like Noones, a new peer-to-peer platform \"dedicated to the global south.\"","The news comes two months after the shuttering of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210117\/localbitcoins-shuts-down-after-a-decade-in-operation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LocalBitcoin<\/a>&nbsp;and narrows the options for people to trade cryptocurrency among themselves. While exchanges, including Binance, offer P2P trading, Paxful and LocalBitcoin were among the few pure-play P2P outfits.","\"With the shutdown of LocalBitcoins and Paxful this year, peer-to-peer bitcoin trading is now much more difficult,\" Steven Zheng, research director at The Block, said. As a result, users can no longer easily trade Bitcoin in a purely private manner.&nbsp;","Paxful, founded in 2015, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/paxful-hits-5-billion-volume-301277325.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hit<\/a> $5 billion in total volume traded on the platform in 2021, with Nigeria, China, India, Kenya, and the U.S. as the top five countries by volume. It was <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/collection\/time100-companies-2022\/6159501\/paxful\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">listed<\/a> as one of the most influential companies of 2022 by Time, boasting around 9 million users at the time. Weekly volume on the exchange peaked around $50 million in May 2022, according to coin.dance data.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">source: coin.dance<\/span>","Ether was removed from its marketplace in December, with CEO Youssef saying, \"revenue is nice, but integrity trumps all,\" at the time, in response to a tweet criticizing Ethereum's design.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Youssef <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194274\/ceo-paxful-tells-customers-get-bitcoin-off-platform\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told customers<\/a> to remove their bitcoin from the platform and move it into self-custody in December.
