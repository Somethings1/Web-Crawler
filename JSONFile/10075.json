In an earlier filing, FTX\u2019s new management claimed it had \u201Ccredible evidence that the Bahamian government is responsible for directing unauthorized access to the Debtors\u2019 systems for the purpose of obtaining digital assets of the Debtors.\u201D","On Dec. 30, the SCB <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/198434\/bahamian-regulator-holding-3-5-billion-of-ftx-customer-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">revealed<\/a> that it has held more than $3.5 billion in FTX customer assets since Nov. 12. Later that day, FTX trading and its affiliated debtors said they would <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/198601\/ftx-debtors-will-seek-return-of-crypto-held-by-bahamas-regulator\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">seek the return<\/a> of that crypto to their Chapter 11 estates for the benefit of creditors \u2014 and alleged that the funds had been transferred after bankruptcy proceedings had started.&nbsp;","\u201CThe FTX Debtors have informed the Bahamas Commission that none of Mr. Bankman-Fried, Mr. Wang or the Bahamas Commission had a right to take cryptocurrency of the FTX Debtors,\u201D the group said in the Dec. 30 statement.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
