Among them, 2,490 contracts can be attributed to five block trades, which are transactions conducted off the public exchange order book due to their large quantities.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: CME Group<\/span><\/em>","Four of the five block trades had a size of 310 contracts, while the one executed on May 19 had a size of 5 contracts. Since traders&nbsp; for all five transactions both purchased and sold the same amount of futures contracts to execute the so-called bull call spreads strategies, contract size in each trade needs to be doubled.&nbsp;","A bull call spread is a trading strategy on derivatives products that consist of both purchasing and selling call options with the same expiration date but different strike prices. In a bull market, traders can place a long call with a lower strike price and a short call with a higher strike price to profit from the spread \u2013 hence the trading strategy's name.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: CME Group <\/span><\/em>","It's worth noting that CME's block trade feature is only available to Eligible Contract Participants, which, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.law.cornell.edu\/uscode\/text\/7\/1a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">defined<\/a> by the Commodity Exchange Act, include financial institutions and investors with more than $10 million assets under management.&nbsp;","CME's bitcoin options product \u2014 launched at the beginning of 2020 \u2014 was constructed as options on the exchange's bitcoin futures.
