They then used this access to transfer the NFTs to their own wallet.","Lawliet <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/iloveponzi\/status\/1488286811462205440\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">took<\/a> to Twitter saying that 13 of his NFTs had been stolen by the attacker including seven Bored Apes, five Mutant Apes, and one Doodle. In total, Lawliet\u2019s loss stands at $2.7 million based on the floor price of the NFTs stolen from his wallet.","The victim\u2019s troubles began when an attacker (likely the same person) took <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RobSawyerUK\/status\/1488281711809077254\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">control<\/a> of the Discord server of another NFT collection called Moschi Mochi to post a fake announcement about an extra mint. The scam involved inviting members of the Moschi Mochi community to participate in an extra mint of 1,000 NFTs for a chance to win a $25,000 raffle.","A look at Lawliet\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x6d0267156f1c6ce44caa4bf129b76009d3d41830\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wallet<\/a> address on Etherscan shows that he interacted with the fake mint and sent 0.49 ETH in exchange for 14 of the scam NFTs. Immediately following the transfer, Lawliet\u2019s transaction history shows numerous \u201Cset approval\u201D transactions.","These set approval transactions all had the hacker\u2019s \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xD27045A8506369a60A227b44bEaDb2Aed2099d70\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">0xD27<\/a>\u201D address set as an <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0x8a032cd0606415de68fe4d3a735eabecf989fdcf21afceb1178a7a8f6b6a4c92\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">approved<\/a> address. This meant that the victim was tricked into calling the \u201CsetApprovalForAll\u201D call when signing these transactions with his own wallet.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The NFTs that were stolen.

In this case, the victim assumed they were regular transactions when in fact he was giving out control over his own NFTs.","There is, however, a feature on MetaMask that allows users to examine the exact nature of their transactions before executing them. This step involves clicking the \u201Cdetails\u201D tab which then displays details about the transaction including vital information like addresses being granted approval. But during the rush for an NFT mint, investors may not always check this.","This particular contract call \u2014 setApprovalForAll \u2014 allowed the hacker to initiate the \u201CtransferFrom\u201D contract call which enabled them to transfer all of the victim\u2019s Bored Apes to another wallet. In programming, a call allows a user to execute the code of another contract, in this case, the ability to transfer NFTs from the victim to the hacker.","Once the attacker had permission to control the victim\u2019s NFTs, they started moving them to a different wallet. The hacker was able to use this method to take the Bored Apes and other NFTs including Mutant Apes and Doodles.","Owners of popular NFT collections like BAYC continue to be targets of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/111782\/white-hat-hacker-saves-117000-in-crypto-from-metamask-phishing-attack\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">social engineering attacks<\/a> aimed at stealing their valuable NFTs. As of the time of writing, the collection has a floor <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/boredapeyachtclub\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">price<\/a> of over 118 ETH ($320,000).","In response to incidents like these, security experts generally advise the use of \u201Cburner wallets,\u201D addresses that contain only a small amount of funds to cover gas fees. Thus, if the transaction happens to be a phishing attack, the victim\u2019s loss will be significantly limited.","Verifying transaction details before approving might also be a useful preventative measure. As Tal Be\u2019ery <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TalBeerySec\/status\/1488435148295135234\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">put it<\/a>, approvals should only go to \u201Ctrustworthy contracts\u201D with relatively long transaction histories. Web wallets like MetaMask show details of transactions and can be a useful tool in spotting phishing attacks.","<i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For more breaking stories like this, make sure to subscribe to The Block on&nbsp;<\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a class=\"c-link\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/the_block_crypto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/t.me\/the_block_crypto\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Telegram<\/a><\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/i>","Â© 2023 The Block.
