The company wanted to keep that information confidential not only due to privacy concerns, but also because it views its customer list as an asset.","\u201CThe debtors' customer list, numbering in the millions, is an asset of the estate,\u201D argued Brian Glueckstein, a partner with Sullivan and Cromwell, which is representing FTX in the bankruptcy proceedings. \u201CPublic release of the customer list would give the debtors\u2019 competitors a free opportunity to poach the debtors' customers and would interfere with the ability to sell assets and maximize value as these cases progress,\u201D he continued.","Glueckstein also argued that \u201Cthere are significant privacy concerns raised by the disclosure of this protected creditor information. The debtors' customer base is global. Those customers who reside in the United Kingdom and the European Union member countries have additional data privacy protections under local law.\u201D","Despite the judge\u2019s interim order keeping creditor information redacted, the U.S. Trustee will still have access to that information on a confidential basis. An additional hearing on the subject is expected next month.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
