This follows Thursday\u2019s high court decision in Montenegro to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281138\/do-kwon-to-be-extradited-to-south-korea-after-court-reverses-extradition-to-us\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">extradite Kwon to South Korea<\/a>.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cafe.naver.com\/lunascam\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, posted on a public online forum hosting the community for Terra-Luna victims with over 2,700 members, claimed that Kwon may not receive the appropriate amount of punishment he allegedly deserves. The U.S. Department of Justice said that it will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281260\/us-challenge-do-kwon-south-korea-extradition\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">continue to pursue<\/a> the extradition of Do Kwon from Montenegro, according to a Bloomberg report on Friday.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CEven if [Kwon] is sentenced in the first trial in South Korea, where rules on punishing crypto crimes have not been established, it is highly likely that the punishment would be reduced significantly in appeals and [Kwon] would be released without proper punishment,\u201D the statement said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">South Korea\u2019s maximum sentence for financial criminals typically ranges from 30 to 40 years, according to local <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.edaily.co.kr\/news\/read?newsId=03457126635547584&amp;mediaCodeNo=257\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">news reports<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The U.S., however, follows a principle where the court can impose consecutive sentences for each crime a defendant is found guilty of. Hence, the potential maximum sentence Kwon could face is deemed higher in the U.S., the statement claimed.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For example, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/279487\/sbf-lawyers-prison-sentence\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sam Bankman-Fried<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, the leader of collapsed FTX exchange who was found guilty last year of defrauding investors, was given a suggested sentence of 100 years from the probation office.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf Kwon Do-hyeong is released from prison after light punishment in Korea, the victims, including myself, will suffer for the rest of their lives,\u201D said the victims in the statement, referring to the Terra co-founder by his full Korean name. \u201CI've been waiting for years, but I don't live expecting Kwon Do-hyeong to compensate for the damage.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Terraform Labs\u2019 algorithmic stablecoin Terra and sister cryptocurrency Luna crashed in May 2022, wiping out over $40 billion worth of market capitalization in a matter of days.
