We\u2019re already moving much much faster. We\u2019ve done three licenses this year, soon to do a fourth, compared to one in all of 2021,\u201D Harris said.","The one authorized in 2021 was Bakkt. Another BitLicensee, Xapo, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/130119\/xapo-closes-shop-in-new-york-gives-up-bitlicense\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">gave up its license<\/a> and left New York in January 2022, weeks before Harris\u2019 confirmation.","The queue to get a BitLicense has been a longstanding grievance among the crypto industry, especially given New York\u2019s status as the global financial center.","\u201CIt\u2019s no secret that the licensing and business filings have taken too long,\u201D Harris said at an earlier fireside chat at Chainalysis\u2019 LINKS conference.","Initiatives aimed at fixing those delays include updating the public <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dfs.ny.gov\/virtual_currency_businesses\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">guidelines<\/a> for BitLicense applications to explain which ones the DFS will consider incomplete.","Harris is also prioritizing crypto-related hiring, aiming to triple the size of DFS\u2019s virtual currency team in 2022. But she also notes a lot of potential for operational streamlining.","Depending on who you ask, New York\u2019s state BitLicense is the gold standard in crypto licensing or a case study in burdensome regulation. Introduced in 2015, only 22 firms hold such licenses, including PayPal\u2019s conditional license which is contingent on its close partnership with Paxos.","Nine crypto companies hold special purpose banking charters, which allow those firms to do business and transmit money in New York. They can also take on fiduciary responsibilities, which legally requires a high degree of concern for a client\u2019s well-being.","The BitLicense framework as drawn criticism over the years. At an April 26 <a href=\"https:\/\/crypto.live.ft.com\/agenda\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">keynote<\/a>, New York City mayor Eric Adams called for an end to the BitLicense. A lawsuit in New York <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/40602\/a-lawsuit-against-nydfs-to-abolish-bitlicense-moves-to-the-states-highest-court\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">aimed to abolish the BitLicense<\/a>. Former US presidential candidate Andrew Yang\u2019s policy <a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190419041346\/https:\/\/www.yang2020.com\/policies\/digital-asset-regulation\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">platform<\/a>, which was celebrated for its encouragement of crypto, highlighted the BitLicense as an example of state regulation gone wrong.","Harris was unfazed. \u201CWe see the demand for the BitLicense and the limited purpose trust continue to go up,\u201D she said, explaining:","\u201CNew York had the first banking law in the country, before there was federal banking law there was new york banking law in the 1800s. And Wall Street is here in New York. It\u2019s not in DC. We have a great regulatory regime. We\u2019re going to improve the operation of it, but the regs themselves I think are wonderful.\u201D","Good actors, she says, want regulation, including what she called \u201Cbespoke supervisory requirements\u201D that the DFS sets up for individual firms. \u201CThat\u2019s why almost half of venture capital investment in crypto last year was in New York-based companies,\u201D she said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
