Fellow committee members Cory Booker, D-N.J., and John Thune, R-S.D., co-sponsored the bill.","The bill would establish a legal definition for digital commodities and place their trading under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

That means any new legislation that seeks to shift regulatory authority will have to go through those other committees, and they have not indicated much interest in reducing the SEC's statutory purview.","With midterm elections coming in November, the legislative calendar for any bills introduced in this Congress is also limited.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
