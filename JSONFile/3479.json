While there, he founded the Fintech practice (Autonomous NEXT), scrutinising the role of crypto assets and blockchain on behalf of a client base made up of institutional investors. He left Lehman Brothers after its collapse in 2008, eventually focusing on research after brief stints at both Barclays and Deutsche Bank.","At ConsenSys, the global Ethereum development studio led by Joe Lubin, Sokolin will be responsible for \"strategy and product development across Fintech, Decentralized Finance and DAOs,\" as well as exploring public and private enterprise blockchain solutions.

The majority of that income came from its enterprise consulting arm.
