He estimates more than half of Alameda's total position came through these wired customer funds to its bank accounts \u2014 and thinks this would be more than $5 billion.","\"I can now go back and take a guess at...where they were ultimately spent, or used, or something,\" Bankman-Fried said when asked to clarify that he did not know what happened to that $5 billion. \"But dollars are fungible with each other, so it's not like this one dollar bill over here that you can trace through from start to finish. What you get is more just omnibus pots of assets at various forms.\"","Osipovich then asked Bankman-Fried how he could own 90% of Alameda and not know what was happening there, to which he replied that he was busy with FTX and also didn't want to get too closely involved with Alameda due to concerns about conflicts of interest."],"hashtag":["FTX"]}
