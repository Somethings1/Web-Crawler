Another offshoot of BNB Greenfield is the ability to create a data marketplace where users can list, trade or sell their data.&nbsp;","The network facilitated over 200,000 on-chain transactions involving 150,000 unique wallet addresses during its testing phase, according to a statement.&nbsp;","\"BNB Greenfield is a transformative development in web3 data ownership and data economy, as it provides users with a decentralized alternative to conventional Cloud services. Distinct from centralized offerings, BNB Greenfield empowers users with control over their data, mitigating the risk of breaches and data loss,\" said BNB Chain senior solution architect Arnaud Bauer in a statement.","Greenfield is one of multiple networks within the BNB ecosystem, alongside others such as BNB Beacon Chain, BNB Smart Chain, opBNB and zkBNB.","Â© 2023 The Block.
