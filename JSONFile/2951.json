Investors aren\u2019t putting their money in digital securities, but they are receiving their shares via digital tokens issued on Ethereum.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Eighty percent of the fund will be invested in \u201Cinterest-bearing, short duration, U.S. Treasury securities,\u201D according to the firm. Investors will receive one ArCoin for each share they hold, and accrued interest is paid to ArCoin holders each quarter.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While ArCoins have utility and leverage Tokensoft\u2019s technology \u2014 they can be used by financial institutions for clearing, settlement, lending, trading and payments, according to Arca \u2014 they are termed \u201Cdigital shares\u201D rather than tokens or digital assets since they represent a share in the fund. Essentially, Arca has merged the capabilities of a crypto token with a paper share to make a so-called digital share.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Digital shares enable more accurate record-keeping for the fund, although Arca stores its records off-chain, according to Jerald David, president of Arca Capital Management LLC.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CArCoin offers enterprises the opportunity to manage their business operations, treasury management and payments with greater efficiency, less cost, faster settlement times and direct tracking of all transactions,\u201D David said in a statement.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That record of ownership also plays a role in protecting investors\u2019 holdings, even from their own mistakes. The ERC-1404 framework only allows holders of whitelisted addresses, as opposed to other protocols like the popular ERC-20. Investors will access their ArCoins through a user portal with Know-Your-Customer and anti-money laundering protections, but they may hold ArCoins in their own wallets, accessible by private keys. This means that holders have some say in who holds their shares, even though UMB maintains custody of the Treasuries.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Usually, lost keys usually mean lost crypto. However, Arca has included a legal structure to its fund that allows shareholders to apply to have ArCoins representing their shares replaced. If one loses their private key, they can apply to the transfer agent, DTAC, for replacements. The blockchain records can prove those ArCoins are sitting in an inaccessible wallet, the shares are voided and reissued.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This product marks the first in a coming portfolio of 1940 Act-compliant financial products, according to the firm. Future offerings and innovations of the existing ArCoin will be based around offering SEC-compliant digital asset products.&nbsp;<\/span>"],"hashtag":["SEC"]}
