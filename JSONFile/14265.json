The collapse of Terra last year led to multiple bankruptcies, as did the collapse of FTX\u2019s FTT token in the fall.","A new law to create standards for stablecoins has been top of the agenda in Congress since the Terra collapse last spring, and bipartisan talks in the House of Representatives ran for months last year as now-House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., and then-House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who remains the top Democrat on the committee, negotiated on legislation for a comprehensive framework.","Despite cooperation from those key policymakers, talks stalled over reluctance from the Treasury Department. Support from the department was seen as helpful to gain support of several fence-sitting Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee and in the Senate, as well as necessary for a bill to receive a presidential signature to become law.&nbsp;","Multiple people familiar with those deliberations say the SEC drove Treasury\u2019s reluctance through constant objections and last-minute revision requests.&nbsp;","\u201CThe stablecoins legislation was coming together over the summer, and the SEC was known to oppose it,\u201D said a former government official familiar with the matter. A major objection was that legislation should only touch \u201Cpayment stablecoins,\u201D the person said. But the SEC demanded a definition so narrow that it would not apply to existing tokens, the person argued.&nbsp;","\u201CI think the true aim was to stop any stablecoin legislation, which interestingly was at odds with the position that they took with the President\u2019s working group report\u201D on digital assets published last year, said the former official. \u201CIt tracked with their activities now, which is essentially claiming through enforcement action that these stablecoins are securities.\u201D","A current industry advocate with previous government experience agreed.&nbsp;\u201CThe SEC was fighting every bill in Congress, period,\u201D they said.","A third person familiar with those talks, who also asked for anonymity to speak freely, disputed the claim that the SEC actively sought to sink the bill.","The SEC provided technical assistance that \u201Cdealt a lot with definitions of issues,\u201D the person said. \u201CSometimes the technical assistance is discordant,\u201D the person added. \u201CIt\u2019s the job of the authors to take what they want and leave with the rest.\u201D&nbsp;","Though any new legislation is unlikely to completely cut the SEC out of regulating digital assets, the lack of new laws in the areas identified as \"regulatory gaps\" by the U.S. government has kept an open vacuum for the SEC to fill.&nbsp;","In February, the agency sent a letter to Paxos informing the crypto infrastructure company of an investigation into its joint stablecoin project with Binance, BUSD. Paxos says it has since stopped minting the token.","And last week the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2023-64\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SEC took action against Beaxy<\/a> due to the way the platform combined several traditionally separate financial activities under one company, another area where the FSOC recommended new laws to create guardrails.&nbsp;","\u201CTo protect investors, there are separate registration requirements for exchanges, brokers, and clearing agencies, with each essentially acting as a check on the other,\u201D Gurbir Grewal, Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement connected to the action. \u201CWhen a crypto intermediary combines all of these functions under one roof\u2014as we allege that Beaxy did\u2014investors are at serious risk. The blurring of functions and the lack of registrations meant that regulations designed to protect investors were not followed or even recognized by Beaxy.\u201D","The move highlights a longstanding criticism of the digital asset space, that \u2018exchanges\u2019 combine functions in ways that traditional stock or commodities exchanges don\u2019t by offering investment accounts, market-making in a way that leads to trading against their own customers and providing loans. Laws and ethical considerations prevent the commingling of those activities.","But a Commodity Futures Trading Commission complaint against crypto behemoth Binance last week also showcased how exchanges may be engaged in activities that concern regulators. The company allegedly operated approximately three hundred undisclosed trading accounts on its own platform, in addition to owner Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao owning two investment firms that traded through the company\u2019s platform, and two of his own personal trading accounts. That fact raises questions about possible market manipulation, as the company traded against its own customers with advantages in speed of execution and internal data.","The SEC has yet to publicly announce an investigation into Binance, though the charges levied by the CFTC last week could likely be applied in a securities law context. The commodities regulator claims that Binance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/223143\/binance-details-from-cftc-complaint\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">knowingly violates U.S law by not enforcing its own geofencing<\/a> for U.S. customers, allowing it to operate illegally in the U.S. The SEC could claim similar illegal securities-related activity if the agency agrees with the CFTC that Binance is illegally doing business in the U.S. market, in addition to other possible violations over combining various activities on the same platform.","Though the SEC does not comment on ongoing investigations, it acknowledged in court that agency staff sees Binance as an unregistered securities exchange as part of an effort to block Binance.US\u2019 acquisition of Voyager Digital Holdings, a bankrupt digital asset firm.","Â© 2023 The Block.
