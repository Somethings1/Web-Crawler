That number has held steady for more than a year despite the tumult in digital assets.","Americans generally find the overall global financial system to be unfair, with 67% of respondents agreeing that it needs \u201Cmajor changes or a complete overhaul,\" according to the survey, which was conducted by Morning Consult in February and polled 2,200 adults.&nbsp;","Coinbase, which facilitates trading in a wide range of crypto assets, touts a user-base topping 100 million. Last year, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/s27.q4cdn.com\/397450999\/files\/doc_financials\/2022\/q4\/Shareholder-Letter-Q4-2022.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> an average of 8.8 million transacting users per month compared to the 8.4 million average in 2021.","The survey indicates that crypto ownership spans demographic and political groups, with 18% and 22% of Republican and Democratic respondents saying they own digital assets.
