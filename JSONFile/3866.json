Regarding the former, the growth of liquid staking protocols in 2023 will allow for staking yields to permeate into broader types of DeFi products, such as interest-bearing stablecoins, pushing up \u2018risk free rates\u2019 across the sector. Regarding the latter, new yield-optimizing DeFi products will start to leverage account abstraction and multichain protocols to pass on multi-loop and cross-chain strategies to users.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The DePIN sector will experience a renaissance amid the growth in either real or perceived utility of decentralized infrastructure for AI.

I predict we will see at least 20 \u201CEthereum-aligned\u201D appchains with $1B TVL or more.

Bullish sentiment early in the year will be driven by the expectation of a Bitcoin ETF approval, which will finally happen in Q1. However, the approval itself will be more of a \u2018sell-the-news\u2019 event without a sustained positive impact on Bitcoin prices in the short term.

Initial crypto excitement in Q1 will likely subside in the wake of a broader economic slowdown driven by the lagged effect of a higher interest rate environment on household and enterprise debt. The U.S. may tip into recession \u2013 or, even if a soft landing is achieved, macroeconomic indicators will be anemic early in the year.

Post-halving, however, we\u2019ll see Bitcoin lose dominance in the face of broad-based alt outperformance. ETH and L2 tokens will rally on the back of EIP-4844\u2019s implementation due to lower fees and renewed narratives around the ecosystem\u2019s scalability. Alt-L1s will also rally as the market also bets on integrated approaches to scaling smart contract platforms. Platforms like Aptos, Sui, Sei, Solana, Monad and NEAR will be subjects of focus as this narrative gains steam.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Privacy-enabled smart contract platforms will be a major narrative throughout the year as platforms like Aztec, Aleo and Mina, among others, launch their fully featured smart-contract-enabled mainnets. There will be continued discussion and controversy regarding the tension between transactional data privacy and compliance in privacy-centric chains, which will be addressed through novel solutions in privacy-preserving proof of identity and proof of innocence protocols.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Total stablecoin market cap will continue to grow, but the top incumbents USDT and USDC will lose market share in the face of growing competition from yield-bearing stablecoins. TRON will lose dominance as the leading platform for low-cost stablecoin transfers as awareness of other low-fee, low-latency chains grows and as other centralized exchanges gain market share from Binance. This trend will also negatively affect USDT in favor of its competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2024 will be a record year for institutional adoption due to more mature infrastructure and new opportunities for yield. More crypto-savvy institutions will leverage app-specific rollups\/chains\/subnets to create walled-garden environments with public chain interoperability and will also take advantage of innovations like smart contract hooks to interact with the counterparties of their choice. With TradFi yields potentially falling in the second half of the year,&nbsp; there will be renewed interest in institutional-grade staking products, and we\u2019ll see a revival of CeFi lending, this time incorporating DeFi elements to enhance transparency and trustlessness.

The growth will be so substantial that the number of rollups deployed on Ethereum will likely exceed the total number of active dApps on some of these rollups. We will see current dApps developing their own rollups and bridging infrastructure, leading to a crowded space (and confusing for newbies) where only a few rollups truly succeed and achieve user activity levels comparable to that of major layer-1s. The typical infrastructure for a \u201Cnon-major\u201D rollup will be to opt to utilize currently available implementations of zero-knowledge proofs (such as Polygon\u2019s Chain Development Kit - CDK) and Celestia\u2019s data availability rather than developing their own zkEVM or zkVM. However, despite the rollup craze, the surge in activity will be mostly driven by airdrop farmers rather than long-term users, while the influx of rollup creation and the necessity of bridging will further degrade and exacerbate the user experience on Ethereum and also lead to more bridge-related hacks, underscoring the importance for more robust wallet solutions and infrastructure improvements to facilitate mass user adoption on modular blockchains.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the anticipated approval of the Bitcoin (and likely Ethereum) Spot ETFs, there will be increased activity and growth in real-world assets (RWAs) and related protocols. However, due to fear of regulatory scrutiny and legal action from the Securities and Exchange Commission, many teams will opt to wait for clarity rather than rush to innovation, hampering the speed of growth in the sector. The Spot ETF approval will give the go-ahead signal for traditional finance and tech companies to ramp up their blockchain research and development initiatives, both on public and private blockchains, by the end of 2024 and 2025. Another large beneficiary of the ETF move will be Coinbase, which will continue to grow its international outreach and likely make new ATHs in revenue and profits by late 2024 and 2025, leading it to become a popular topic on Wall Street.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In another Universe, Layer-0 networks such as Polkadot and Cosmos will continue their growth and development, but they may also continue receiving less attention compared to the newer, less modular but shiny Layer-1s, and Layer-2s. On the other hand, Solana will significantly grow both in its ecosystem and market capitalization (cementing itself as the new number 3 instead of BNB Chain), and host new types of dApps and trends that are more retail-focused and not possible on Ethereum.

The US election in September 2024 will prove pivotal for the further treatment of crypto in the US. Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and South Korea will keep making small steps on their currently friendly crypto policy path, with Hong Kong getting increasingly bold in order to try to overcome the serious loss of business to Singapore during the lockdown years.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While 2023 activity has been mostly driven by institutions and incumbents, 2024 will bring back more genuine retail users. Surging on-chain activity will once more increase fees, push blockchains to their limits, and make the alt L1 narrative blossom once more. New ecosystem participants will onboard rather on Solana and other alt L1s than on Ethereum. The modular vs. monolithic question will ring once more through the Ethereum ecosystem, as many L2s fail to draw meaningful economic activity. Coupled, these two trends will lead to serious questions being asking within the Ethereum ecosystem about where to go from here. Moreover, new ecosystem participants will push both Gaming projects and memecoins to new heights. NFTs will also catch a serious bid once more, with legacy media putting renewed attention on pfps.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Edvinas Rupkus<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2024 will be another memorable year in the crypto timeline, mostly from a positive perspective. Prospects of the global and primarily the US economy bringing inflation down without a major recession and a long-awaited ETF approval will increase risk appetite for many institutional and retail investors.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In general, 2024 will be similar to 2021 in terms of price action and overall activity onchain. If 2021 was about Layer-1 chains and the chase to be the \u201CEth killer,\u201D the narrative in 2024 will be about Layer-2 rollups and modular blockchain solutions.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The chase for airdrops will lead to users trying out newer bridges, ending in a major bridge exploit. I expect many pump-and-dump schemes, especially on newly released rollups, which will be a major talking point for blockchain skeptics in Congress.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Since it will be an election year, crypto may become a partisan issue, with Democrats taking the anti- and Republicans taking the pro-crypto side. In the end, it will be just political signaling without serious legislation being passed towards crypto in 2024. We will, however, see more productive conversations and legislation passed in other parts of the world. One more country will follow El Salvador\u2019s example and accept Bitcoin as legal tender.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I am most excited about the dePIN sector of crypto and the potential projects such as Helium have for real-world applications. Token prices will still drive its application, requiring project founders to be creative and intelligent about tokenomics to ensure the project is sustainable throughout crypto cycles.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ian Devendorf<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2024, BTC dominance will continue to climb to reach roughly 70% in the first half of the year, driven by the approval of spot bitcoin ETF applications in Q1 and the Bitcoin halving event in Q2. If macro and liquidity conditions allow, BTC dominance will fade in the second half of the year as altcoins outperform with narratives around ETH scaling and Alt-L1\u2019s such as Solana, Near, Aptos, Sui, and others.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lending protocols and stablecoins will continue to benefit from incorporating real-world assets amid a high interest-rate environment. Corporate stablecoin launches will continue in 2024, as the ability to leverage short-term treasuries as collateral presents an attractive business model, though unique demand drivers will need to be established to gain meaningful market share. USDT will remain the dominant stablecoin by market share as its higher liquidity and entrenchment in various markets will prove difficult to overcome.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum\u2019s Cancun\/Deneb upgrade will happen sometime in Q2 2024, which will result in positive price action for Ethereum L2s, including Optimism, Base, and Arbitrum, as profit margins improve. Although Ethereum\u2019s fee revenue from L2s will diminish in 2024, Ethereum\u2019s total fee revenue will be impacted only slightly as the bulk of revenue will continue to come from transactions directly on Ethereum. Rollups will continue to deal with ongoing technical challenges throughout 2024, limiting their adoption and the percentage of fee revenue contributed to Ethereum.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Afif Bandak<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Spot BTC ETFs are launched in the US and see $10B of inflows this year. An ETH spot ETF is also approved in the US by Q4. The modular thesis continues to strengthen, ushering in a rollup Renaissance. EIP-4844 is deployed on mainnet; blob data accounts for 10-20% of ETH fees by EoY. Parallelized EVM chains will become a moderately popular narrative in 2024. LSDfi and staking continue to be the main DeFi narrative drivers.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Shamel Tejani<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2024 will prove to be a more bullish year than 2023 for crypto participants. This will be the largest year for crypto airdrops. The main driver for retail adoption this year will not be the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF or price appreciation in major crypto assets but rather the \u2018fomo\u2019 induced by airdrops. Big names such as zkSync, Starknet, Linea, LayerZero, and many projects in the Cosmos and Solana ecosystem are all due to launch their tokens, with many having made announcements of doing so before Q3. This will inject billions of dollars in liquidity into their respective ecosystems, allowing for rotations into native memes and NFTs, creating a wealth effect. Speculation around the Ethereum ETF and the Dencun upgrade mixed with the launch of EigenLayer, will bring attention back to ETH, giving ETH\/BTC some relief. DEX volumes increase against CEX\u2019s, with new projects taking over. Bitcoin will drop 25% sometime during the first half of 2024. GCR starts tweeting again.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Brad Kay<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2024, Ethereum will maintain its position as the leader in NFT volume, followed closely by Bitcoin and Solana. A notable development in the Bitcoin network will be the successful launch of a decentralized exchange (DEX) for BRC20 tokens. This advancement, akin to the transformative impact of Blur on NFTs, will revolutionize the way BRC20 tokens are traded, enhancing price discovery and substantially increasing trading volumes. Furthermore, we will observe a continued decline in royalty earnings on the Ethereum network. This trend will be driven by competitive pressures among marketplaces as they struggle to enforce royalty agreements.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">John Dantoni<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2024, we are poised to witness a groundbreaking year for digital assets, characterized by pivotal moments that will redefine the landscape and drive new growth. The highly anticipated approval of a Bitcoin ETF promises to inject new vitality into the sector, unlocking new liquidity.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Amidst this backdrop, two dominant investment philosophies, the modular and integrated approaches, will shape the investment landscape. Ethereum, bolstered by roll apps and modular protocols like Celestia, is set to lead the modular thesis. Simultaneously, Solana\u2019s unwavering dominance in the integrated space will attract a wave of venture capital, positioning itself as the primary alternative to Ethereum and securing substantial financing.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Emerging narratives such as RWAs, DePin, and SocialFi will vie for market share, with Solana\u2019s ecosystem emerging as the incubator for these early protocols that gain traction. The bulk of venture funding in this space will gravitate toward these types of applications, reinforcing Solana\u2019s role in shaping the future of digital assets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the realm of Bitcoin, 2024 marks a resurgence of experimentation, with DeFi, Memecoins, and NFTs flourishing within its ecosystem. Solutions like Ordinals, Stacks, and BRC20 will serve as the catalysts for this experimentation. Discussions on inhibiting this growing ecosystem may arise, but the undeniable forces of the market and increased mining revenue will prevail, compelling proponents to embrace the evolving narratives within the Bitcoin ecosystem.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Venture funding is poised to undergo a noteworthy surge in 2024, acting as a lagging yet substantial indicator of the escalating market capitalization of digital assets. The first half of the year will witness venture funding reflecting the price appreciation already experienced, receiving in aggregate $6.5 billion. As euphoria permeates the funding markets in the second half, monthly funding will soar to an average of $3 billion, reminiscent of the fervor witnessed during the 2021\/22 run-up. By the end of 2024, the total venture funding will reach $24.5 billion, marking a 130% year-over-year increase in private funding.<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
