This release follows the alarming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/196941\/the-biggest-crypto-hacks-of-2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$3 billion<\/a> lost to protocol hacks in 2022.","The tool utilizes an advanced type of fuzzing technique called greybox fuzzing to pinpoint bugs in smart contracts. This approach examines the functional properties of entire contract systems, not just individual functions. Its thorough approach sets it apart, making it notably more efficient than other available smart contract audit tools, Consensys asserts.","When paired with <a href=\"https:\/\/consensys.io\/diligence\/scribble\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Scribble<\/a>, another open-source tool from Consensys, developers can streamline their security testing process, deploying securely on the Ethereum mainnet using Diligence Fuzzing.","\u201COur automated tool is meticulously crafted to unearth vulnerabilities in smart contracts. It stands out by offering an unmatched security solution, setting benchmarks for code coverage, speed, and bug detection,\u201D said Liz Daldalian, the Lead at Consensys Diligence. \u201CThe launch of Diligence Fuzzing solidifies our unwavering devotion to enhancing smart contract security, aiming to make it user-friendly and accessible to all developers in the Ethereum ecosystem.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
