This will live on the Avalanche blockchain and effectively give access to investors through a tokenized feeder fund, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/kkr-makes-piece-of-pe-fund-available-on-public-blockchain-11663014955\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the report said<\/a>.","Executives told the WSJ that this is the first time a PE giant such as KKR has used the blockchain in this way.&nbsp;","While this aims to broaden access to the fund, the bar is still high. Qualified purchasers of the tokenized assets will still typically have to hold at least $5 million in investable assets. Interested parties will also have to create a digital wallet and sign up with Securitize. The fund allows individuals to invest smaller amounts than would usually be required of institutions.","After a year of holding the security, it can then be sold to other qualified individuals on the secondary market.","This is not KKR's first dalliance with digital assets.
