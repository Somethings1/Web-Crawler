This figure accounted for 66% of all votes cast. Meanwhile, only two addresses, amounting to 21 million LDO tokens, voted in support of the token sale.","The token sale is part of a treasury diversification <a href=\"https:\/\/research.lido.fi\/t\/treasury-diversification-2\/2570\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal<\/a> for Lido.
