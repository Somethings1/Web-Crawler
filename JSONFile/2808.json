COIN has an average price target on the Street of $69.17 \u2014 an increase from $61.72 in January, according to data compiled by The Block Research. Furthermore, 37% of research analysts have a \"buy\" rating for the stock as of June 5. That's up from 33% in January.&nbsp;","","","As for what happens next for the stock, Palmer told The Block the firm's rating for the stock, which is currently a hold, is under review. He added that upside will be tied to Coinbase's push outside the U.S.","\"We believe the lawsuit will cause investors to focus on the company's ability to execute a pivot to overseas markets, which will not be easy,\" Palmer said.&nbsp;","Needham's Todaro said that the market should be on the look out for potential delistings by COIN or \"ending certain business lines.\" Moves he described as \"more unexpected.\"","COIN has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since the beginning of the year, as noted by The Block Research. The exchange has picked up 65% this year compared to the benchmark index's gain of 11%.&nbsp;","","","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
