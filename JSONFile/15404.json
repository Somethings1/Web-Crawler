Per Volmex, the two indices are analogous to Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the VIX index, which is derived from the options market tied to the S&P 500 index.","Starting April 3, Bitfinex users can trade bitcoin and ether volatility futures under the ticker symbols BVIVF0:USTFO and EVIVFO:USDTFO, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk. These contracts are denominated, margined, and settled in tether (USDT), the world\u2019s largest dollar-pegged stablecoin.","Perpetuals are futures contracts with no expiry and a funding rate mechanism that helps keep prices for perpetuals in sync with the underlying asset\/index.","The availability of volatility futures means Bitfinex users can bet on how fast the anticipated bullish or bearish price move in bitcoin and ether will happen. Being long volatility means betting the asset\u2019s price might move violently in either direction.","The volatility futures will help traders navigate binary events like crucial U.S. economic data releases, Fed rate decisions, and crypto-specific events that have the potential to inject volatility into the market and open doors to retail investors who lack the resources or expertise to set up complex options strategies like straddles and strangles to profit from changes in implied volatility.","Bitfinex\u2019s new offering comes a year after dominant crypto options exchange Deribit listed standard futures contracts tied to its proprietary bitcoin volatility index, DVOL.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 3","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fed","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VIX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Ether","Markets","Volatility","perpetual contracts"],"authors":["Omkar Godbole"]}
