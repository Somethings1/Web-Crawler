Over the past week alone, Pancakeswap V3 has done around $900 million in volume with only about $230 million in liquidity.\"","\"It's hard to say definitively if it represents a broader shift away from centralized exchanges \u2014 the largest being Binance \u2014 but it does coincide with a period in May where DEX volumes as a percentage of CEX volume reached an all-time high,\" Peng said.&nbsp;","BNB Chain is a blockchain launched by the crypto exchange Binance.
