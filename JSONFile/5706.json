In the crypto markets, however, research tools are far more distributed, unstructured, and difficult to discover.","As researchers and analysts in the crypto industry,&nbsp;we've noticed that many reports or analyses on a variety of exciting topics are often published without providing the much-needed sources for them.&nbsp;In a field where \u201CDo Your Own Research (DYOR),\u201D is a continuously repeated mantra,&nbsp;it is surprising that many are so protective of their data sources and tools. The Block believes that for the industry to move forward we need to be transparent and analysts in the industry should have access to the very best tools to aid their analysis.","Whether you are an investor, journalist, or a crypto enthusiast you should be spending less time looking for tools and more time using them. This is why The Block has compiled a list of resources and tools we have found valuable in our research process. This list will be updated as new tools and resources for blockchain networks are developed and discovered.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
