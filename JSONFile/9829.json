Ninjalerts also provides tools and <a href=\"http:\/\/ninjalerts.gitbook.io\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">guidance<\/a> for uploading permanent and functional video games onto Bitcoin \u2014 explaining how to store Read-Only Memory game files on Bitcoin in an encrypted and password-protected format, according to a statement.","Ninjalerts said the initiative was inspired by last year\u2019s commercial availability <a href=\"https:\/\/gamehistory.org\/87percent\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">study<\/a> from the Video Game History Foundation, in partnership with the Software Preservation Network \u2014 finding that 87% of classic video games released in the United States are \u201Ccritically endangered.\u201D","Regarding compliance with copyright laws, Ninjalerts <a href=\"https:\/\/ninjalerts.gitbook.io\/ordinals\/not-legal-advice-game-emulation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>, \u201CUnder U.S. Copyright Law, particularly Section 117 of the Copyright Act, owners of legal copies of computer programs (including video games) are allowed to make a backup copy for archival purposes.\u201D","\u201CNinjalerts recommends users find legal methods to utilize these tools for video game preservation, such as making personal backups of owned games, and avoid any activities that could be considered copyright infringement,\u201D it added.","Nintendo did not respond to a request for comment from The Block.","The Pizza Ninjas project is set to launch with an embedded SNES emulator in each Ninja profile picture NFT, allowing users to play games in their browser across any Ordinals explorer or marketplace by loading ROMs from their computer or existing inscriptions on Bitcoin.","As the emulator files exist independently on Bitcoin, they also have a broader application beyond the Pizza Ninjas project, Ninjalerts said \u2014 combining advanced capabilities of Bitcoin Ordinals' architecture with technologies like WebAssembly and JavaScript.","A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uikpAvxxNCI\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">demo<\/a> of the Super Nintendo emulator can be found on YouTube.","However, users hoping to upload more advanced games to Bitcoin will probably be left disappointed. \u201CA 16-bit system like SNES is likely the largest we can practically go (from a file size perspective) for putting old video games and software emulation fully on Bitcoin,\u201D Ninjalerts CEO Trevor Owens said.","The \u201Cmaximum inscription size per transaction is around 400kb without going to a miner,\u201D Owens told The Block. \u201CMost SNES games are 1MB to 4MB, which can get below 400kb or under 1 MB with the right compression. Game Boy Advance, on the other hand is a 32-bit system, where the smallest games are 4 MB and better games are 32 to 64 MB.\u201D","Inscribing such data isn\u2019t cheap either, with the average cost per kilobyte of data stored on Bitcoin being $44 in December and $19 in November, <a href=\"https:\/\/blockchair.com\/bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to the blockchain explorer Blockchair. With the SNES nearly 10 MB in size, that cost could be substantial.","However, by streamlining the code and then further compressing it, Ninjalerts got the size down to 700kb, Owens told The Block. Combined with lower transaction fees on Bitcoin this week compared to December, the inscription cost came out at an estimated $3,762.50, he said.","Despite the potential cost, Ninjalerts said utilizing the Bitcoin network ensures the highest chance of preserving valuable and culturally significant data. \u201CWith an estimated 52,766 Bitcoin nodes operational as of Jan. 5, the Bitcoin network is unrivaled in its capacity for long-term archival storage,\u201D it added.","Pizza Ninjas is set to mint its profile picture NFTs on Jan. 16 via the Magic Eden marketplace platform.","The rise in popularity of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207086\/what-are-bitcoin-nfts-ordinals-and-how-do-they-work\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ordinals<\/a> on Bitcoin last year fueled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266512\/why-bitcoin-miners-are-unlikely-to-fight-a-moral-battle-over-ordinals\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">debate<\/a> over whether or not inscriptions representing things like NFTs and BRC-20 tokens on Bitcoin should exist.

Others maintain that such unconventional uses are an integral part of any upgrade, and usage should continue as long as users comply with Bitcoin\u2019s rules.","The popularity of inscriptions caused transactions to surge on Bitcoin, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266272\/brc-20-style-tokens-are-spreading-to-chains-beyond-bitcoin-but-why\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">other blockchains<\/a>, last year, with the share of Bitcoin miner revenue from transaction fees compared to the block reward subsidy rising concurrently.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-miner-revenue-daily\/embed\" title=\"Bitcoin Miner Revenue (Daily, 7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","However, the activity also led to congestion, causing fees to rise, with Bitcoin users encountering delays in processing transactions without paying the higher fees.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with additional comments from Trevor Owens.<\/em>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
