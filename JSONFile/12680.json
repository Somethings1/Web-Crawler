They described it as \u201Cessentially a treasury team\u201D that also handles setting up nodes and hedging, helping to offset the volatility of Animoca\u2019s vast trove of volatile tokens.&nbsp;","\u201CIts primary role, much like the treasury teams in many large corporations, is to optimize the utilization of the company\u2019s balance sheet,\u201D the Animoca spokesperson said. \u201CThe team does conduct market-making to ensure there is enough buy\/sell liquidity for certain tokens, which is similar to the function that third-party market makers conduct, except that we choose to perform this in-house for scale and efficiency.\u201D","Animoca has pitched its Digital Asset Team\u2019s capabilities to portfolio companies, as well as, in rare cases, to external companies where it sees potential alignment. Open Campus, an education-focused protocol, is one example of a client of the service.","Market making is not unique to the world of cryptocurrencies. On Wall Street, similar firms play a crucial role in ensuring an adequate supply of liquidity for investors and traders, allowing them to smoothly buy and sell stocks or assets. In crypto, there are also companies that specialize in market making for a particular token. Token market makers provide services directly to projects, often with the goal of supporting a successful market launch, strong trading activity and reduced price volatility.","But the existence of such teams within crypto outfits that offer a much wider range of services has in the past proven controversial.&nbsp;","The derivatives exchange BitMEX \u2014 which is <a href=\"https:\/\/content.next.westlaw.com\/Document\/I0f4a473471fa11ebbea4f0dc9fb69570\/View\/FullText.html?contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;transitionType=Default\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">no stranger to accusations<\/a> of insider trading \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235881\/crypto-exchanges-market-makers-bitmex\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recently called for the industry to phase out internal market making desks<\/a>. That came off the back of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235881\/crypto-exchanges-market-makers-bitmex\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a Financial Times report<\/a> on Crypto.com\u2019s internal trading and market making teams, which raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest.&nbsp;","\u201CIf the asset issuer controls the trading strategy, similar to FTT and Alameda, it would be the equivalent of Tesla or Amazon market making their own stock. There\u2019s a clear conflict of interest with internal trading desks in crypto as it\u2019s hard to avoid market manipulation and insider trading restrictions,\u201D said Matt Batsinelas, founder of Glass Markets, a liquidity and market making analytics provider.&nbsp;","Animoca\u2019s spokesperson, however, stressed that its Digital Asset Team \u201Cis not an in-house trading desk that takes on proprietary trading positions\u201D \u2014 in other words it does not trade tokens for profit. The services offered by its Digital Asset Team are \u201Coptional add-ons that are negotiated on an arm\u2019s length basis.\u201D&nbsp;","\u201CBefore we extend any such service, prospective companies are subject to an extensive selection process to ensure they align with our standards and policies,\u201D they added.&nbsp;","As with most crypto outfits, the prolonged bear market that began last year has taken its toll on the trove of tokens amassed by Animoca. In May, the company said the value of its token reserves <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/animoca-brands-token-reserves-down-36-after-crypto-plunge-2023-05-12\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">had fallen 36% to $2.7 billion<\/a>.
