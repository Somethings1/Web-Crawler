Additionally, the $6.1 trillion in principal might also be used to push up the prices of assets, he argued.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">U.S. money market funds.

The halving is expected to occur in April, with Thielen noting bitcoin prices have risen 192% on average in such years.","As 2024 is also a U.S. presidential election year, Thielen added there was a \"high likelihood\" that former President Donald Trump will be elected again, with his policies potentially boosting the U.S. economy, alongside the stock market and crypto prices, the analyst said.","Thielen noted that despite the potential for a Republican President to be back in control of the White House, Democrat SEC Chair Gary Gensler could remain in office until his term expires in June 2026. Thielen expects a spot bitcoin ETF to have been approved by then anyway, but added that Trump \u2014 who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/195431\/only-99-former-us-president-donald-trump-unveils-nft-trading-card-collection\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> his own NFT collection last year and new \"Mugshot Edition\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/267294\/trump-hawks-new-nfts-for-a-chance-to-win-a-piece-of-his-mugshot-suit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NFT trading cards<\/a> this week \u2014 \"will likely support another initiative that cements digital assets as a cornerstone of the economy.\"","However, in terms of the remaining weeks of 2023, Thielen expects bitcoin prices to remain within the $40,000 to $45,000 range before another rally attempt in January as traders eye potential spot bitcoin ETF approval dates. Bitcoin is currently trading at $42,652, according to The Block\u2019s price data \u2014 up over 150% year-to-date.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BTC\/USD price chart.
