It outlines the nuances that need to be taken into account to holistically evaluate the settlement guarantees that different blockchains provide. Additionally, it identifies several real-life events (i.e, chain reorganizations, spam attacks and network congestion\/downtime), which routinely impact settlement in live production environments; irrespective of how finality is theoretically achieved.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Finally, the report outlines how layer-2 scaling solutions, which decouple transaction execution and transaction finalization, are introducing new complications when it comes to analyzing finality.&nbsp;<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
