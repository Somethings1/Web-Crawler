The ruling notes that 14 billion out of the 18.5 billion supply of UST tokens were deposited in Anchor by May 2022.&nbsp;","Rakoff did rule in favor of the defendants on one charge, finding that Terra's Mirror Protocol \"mAssets,\" which mirrored real-world assets like stocks for trading, did not constitute security-based swaps, throwing out two charges.&nbsp;","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chai: misrepresentation or misunderstanding?<\/strong>","Judge Rakoff also detailed evidence brought by the SEC that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/212835\/u-s-investigation-into-do-kwon-and-his-infamous-stablecoin-unveils-several-new-revelations\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chai payments platform<\/a>, which was often cited by Kwon as a real-world use case of the Terra blockchain for promotional purposes, never ran on the Terra blockchain in the first place. Instead, payments were allegedly settled using traditional methods and then 'mirrored' on the Terra blockchain by a server controlled by Kwon.&nbsp;","This <a href=\"https:\/\/storage.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150\/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150.149.0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">evidence<\/a> includes previously known information from the SEC's filings along with new revelations, such as a May 2020 email from a Chai employee that states Chai would&nbsp; \u201Cprocess transaction[s] outside [the] blockchain\u201D and then \u201Cwrite a record on the Terra blockchain in parallel.\u201D&nbsp;","The filing also includes statements from an SEC whistleblower, Chai's Chief Product Officer, who was told by a former Terraform employee who joined Chai that \"there's no crypto going on within Chai.\" That whistleblower also claims to have confronted Kwon about Chai's true nature in September 2021, at which point Kwon didn't deny the allegation but rather stated that he did not \"give a [expletive] about Chai.\"&nbsp;","While the evidence appears strong, Judge Rakoff found that \"genuine disputes of material fact linger that preclude summary judgment for any party on the fraud claims.\" The disputes arise from the fact that much of the SEC's evidence comes from whistleblowers whom jurors might find less than credible \u2014 especially since the aforementioned whistleblower tried to extort Do Kwon and Terra co-founder\/Chai founder Daniel Shin after being fired from Chai, according to the defense. There are also elements of that whistleblower's story that have changed over time, such as whether he had direct knowledge of Chai's systems or merely heard about it from employees.&nbsp;","Terraform's current CEO, Chris Amani, has <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/fleece_cannon\/status\/1707775540684628444?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated outright<\/a> that Chai used the blockchain in response to similar accusations of fraud in the past.
