Most investors, however, joined the round earlier at a valuation of $500 million, the source added.","IO Research's fundraise at a $1 billion token FDV is notable since io.net's native IO token is expected to launch April 28, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/279643\/solana-based-depin-protocol-io-net-unveils-rewards-program-ahead-of-april-token-launch\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block reported<\/a> last week.","With fresh funding in place, the project looks to grow its current team of around 50 to 100 people by the end of the year to meet customer demand and continue building out the network.","Io.net, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/279643\/solana-based-depin-protocol-io-net-unveils-rewards-program-ahead-of-april-token-launch\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Solana-based DePIN project<\/a> focused on sourcing GPU computing power, aggregates GPU resources for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) companies at lower costs and faster lead times. It was launched last November and claims to have grown to over 25,000 GPUs and processed over 40,000 compute hours for AI and ML companies.","GPUs are \"the scarcest commodity in the world,\" according to Shayon Sengupta, investment partner at Multicoin Capital, one of io.net's investors. He said industry analysts are \"still radically underestimating\" how much computing power will be needed to fuel the next generation of AI apps. Io.net has the potential to democratize GPU computing, he added.","Io.net uses the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252775\/solana-depin-projects-gig-economy-next-level\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Solana<\/a> blockchain to provide transparent proof-of-compute and make every job and transaction between supplier and consumer visible on-chain. The IO token, in turn, provides a unified transaction experience for users and enables incentive mechanisms for suppliers, customers, and users to participate and grow the network.","\"Io.net saves customers up to 90% on their cloud AI costs,\" Ed Roman, managing partner at Hack VC, said in a statement. \"In an age where GPU chips are in high demand with global shortages, that is simply an incredible accomplishment.\"","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
