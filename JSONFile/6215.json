As the hearing extended to nearly five hours, viewership declined. Nonetheless, it was a significant, public moment for the crypto industry.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis is the first cryptocurrency hearing this committee has had in 13 years [since the Bitcoin whitepaper],\u201D the committee\u2019s leading Republican, Patrick McHenry, told The Block. The most comparable event was the 2019 hearings for Libra, which at the time signified more of a condemnation of Facebook's plans.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As representatives of the industry, the witnesses were on some level running defense against more aggressive regulation. But as has been the case throughout Congress lately, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/124728\/with-demystifying-crypto-hearing-is-congress-coming-to-a-consensus\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reception has warmed<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. As several committee members observed in their questions, the fact of holding such a full-committee educational hearing was indicative of a major shift in congressional interest in crypto.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The firms represented \u2014 Bitfury, Circle, Coinbase, FTX, Paxos and the Stellar Development Foundation \u2014 were not necessarily the largest by valuation but were among those most engaged with U.S. politics.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As The Block <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/126682\/what-to-expect-at-wednesdays-hearing-on-crypto-before-congress\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote yesterday<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, the central concerns were regulatory regimes for stablecoins and trading platforms. As Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters commented, \u201CCurrently, cryptocurrency markets have no overarching centralized framework.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The stablecoin piece was especially pressing \u2014 Congressman Warren Davidson called it \u201Cthe lowest-hanging fruit\u201D \u2014 as it seems the most similar to existing rules for banks. And indeed, frequent crypto critic Rep. Brad Sherman lamented that Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, \u201Cdidn\u2019t even show up.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Circle and Paxos, involved with two of the largest USD-backed stablecoins, did have representation present: Jeremy Allaire and Charles Cascarilla, both of whom have become familiar figures in congressional hearings. In one exchange, Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez asked the two of them to verify that all of their backings were in cash or Treasury bills before getting their support for federal standards. The two CEOs agreed.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Most prominent were the proposals to limit their issuance to insured depository institutions, or IDIs, in the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/122890\/us-treasury-releases-long-awaited-report-on-stablecoin-risk-features-request-for-new-laws\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">President\u2019s Working Group report on stablecoins<\/a>. Broadly, the industry is not onboard.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIs it consistent to take the position that only banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins, but then fail to grant bank charters to the largest issuers of stablecoins?\u201D asked Brian Brooks, current CEO of Bitfury and a former Comptroller of the Currency.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The other big issue was an overarching regulator for trading platforms. Both Alesia Haas, Coinbase\u2019s global CFO, and FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried supported some form of harmonization. However, Haas maintained, under oath, that the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, had provided no further explanation for its push to shut down <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/117140\/secs-handling-of-coinbase-lend-signals-sea-change-for-us-crypto-lending\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase\u2019s Lend product<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The argument for a consistent regulatory regime drew some sympathy across the committee, but the devil remains in the details. The SEC and its sister regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are themselves arguing out their respective roles within the crypto ecosystem. There is more and more talk of expanding the CFTC\u2019s regulatory purview into spot markets for cryptocurrency, where the commission currently only regulates futures trading.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Historically, congressional Democrats have been more interested than Republicans in more aggressive regulation of crypto. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posited that \u201Cthis doesn\u2019t seem like a new system so much as an expansion of our present one.\u201D Rep. Sherman went further, saying: \u201CThe fact is that the advocates of crypto represent the powers in our society.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In some ways, this dynamic continues, especially as it becomes more of a prerogative of the Biden administration\u2019s executive appointments.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CNo mistake that the Democrats who control the agenda here on the Hill are matched up with what we hear from the regulators run by Democrats,\u201D Congressman McHenry told The Block. \u201CThe mentions of stablecoins and exchanges match with what we understand the regulators are going to move forward on. So in many respects, some of my Democrat friends are trying to provide cover for their other Democrat friends.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Interestingly, several Democrats who entered the committee this year seemed more interested in crypto\u2019s potential positive impacts. Rep. Ritchie Torres asked the witnesses how stablecoins could help the large immigrant population in his district in the South Bronx facilitate cheaper remittances.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rep. Jake Auchincloss decried the current regime of regulation by enforcement and negotiation on a \u201Cone-off basis\u201D with the SEC and CFTC. He seemed to echo FTX\u2019s policy push for a designated primary single regulator, at least on a temporary basis. <\/span>","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
