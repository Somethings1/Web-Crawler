The sector also faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny as agencies voice concerns about the potential for fraud.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tokenization, on the other hand, is focused on \"solving an actual problem\" such as settlement, Hsu said, adding it could simplify fees and frictions in the transaction process.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"When I talk to folks, there is increasing interest in tokenization because it solves a problem, and less and less interest in crypto,\" Hsu said. His<\/span>&nbsp;statements on Tuesday were largely in line with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.occ.gov\/news-issuances\/news-releases\/2023\/nr-occ-2023-64.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">comments<\/a> he made in June.&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Some have estimated that tokenization of real-world assets could save 35 to 65 percent across the settlement value chain, including, for instance, cost savings of up to $5 billion for equity-post trading. Tokenization of fiat currencies for cross-border payments also holds the promise of reducing frictions, costs, and delays,\" Hsu said in a speech in San Antonio. \"<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Importantly, tokenization does not require decentralization and trustlessness.\"<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
