Wait, I should be more specific. I started reading the third edition published in 2015, during what Shiller identified as another asset run-up. The modern classic economics text was first printed in 2000, before the implosion of the \u201Cdot com boom,\u201D and again in 2005, ahead of what turned out to be a housing market meltdown.","Shiller, you may not be surprised to learn, is not a huge fan of cryptocurrencies. He\u2019s said interest in the sector is part of the \u201CWild West\u201D mentality across stock, housing and bond markets. Something of a \u201Cperma-bear,\u201D his dour prognostications seem to come from a place of concern about painful losses for investors of all stripes \u2026 in addition to selling books.","This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk\u2019s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news.

Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor for financial stability, yesterday likened the $2.3 trillion crypto market to the $1.2 trillion subprime mortgage market in 2008, which contributed to that decade\u2019s great financial crisis. Risks aren\u2019t localized, but shared across this interconnected, global financial system.","\u201CThe crypto world is beginning to connect to the traditional financial system, and we are seeing the emergence of leveraged players. And, crucially, this is happening in largely unregulated space,\u201D Cunliffe said. Could a major price correction in the volatile crypto market cause knock-on effects? Cunliffe was short on specifics and also on recommendations.","Indeed, today, crypto is something more than just an economic niche. Major financial actors, from pension funds to hedge funds, are taking on exposure to crypto assets \u2013 buying bitcoin directly, buying shares in investable vehicles like trusts and even leading capital raises for crypto startups. Millions of Americans trade in crypto markets. A nation state \u201Chodls\u201D bitcoin.","It seems fair to \u201Ctake notice,\u201D as Cunliffe says, of an industry that has exploded in value from $16 billion five years ago to the juggernaut it is today. But concerns from financial overseers are also a bit misplaced and seem designed to scapegoat crypto for overheated financial markets that their policies enable.","Cunliffe, to his credit, wasn\u2019t totally paternalistic. He cautioned governments and regulators against overreacting to this novel tech-driven sector and added that crypto could offer \u201Cradical improvements\u201D to traditional financial services.","Of those improvements, he might mention, is the fact that crypto does offer a more \u201Cinterconnected\u201D economy. Crypto is something new, something frightening, something potentially dangerous because blockchains and smart contracts open access to financial services to nearly everyone. It leaches power from power brokers and decision makers.","But as much as people talk about bitcoin \u201Cdecoupling\u201D from the financial system, that seems unlikely. The full picture is still emerging \u2013 crypto sometimes moves up and down following classic inflation hedges, sometimes like tech stocks, sometimes independently. But interconnected it is, and the sector\u2019s growth isn\u2019t whole and away independent from the runup in asset prices across the economy.","See also: Bubbles Are Good for Bitcoin | Yanhao Max Wei","Bitcoin may be the best performing asset ever, but its growth coincided with the longest and most profitable bull market in stocks in history. The S&P 500, a benchmark, closed out a decade-long bull run beginning March 2009 with 370% returns. It\u2019s still growing. And the same cheap money policies and \u201Cinflation is good\u201D mentality driving it are still in play.","Shiller, the expert on how emotions and narratives drive finance, has also noted the \u201Cimpressive technology\u201D behind crypto. But always the skeptic, he also thinks its \u201Cultimate source of value is so ambiguous that it has a lot to do with our narratives rather than reality.\u201D That was true too, he thinks, for the 90s\u2019 tech sector, the aught\u2019s housing speculation and today\u2019s meme stocks.","But what\u2019s the bigger story behind this bubble?"],"entity":[{"type":"2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2005","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2.3 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1.2 trillion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Cunliffe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2000","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bank of England","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$16 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Robert Shiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2008","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Yale","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jon Cunliffe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin | Yanhao Max Wei","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2009","content":"DATE"},{"type":"370%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Shiller","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bubble","Bitcoin","The Node","Newsletters","Opinion","Regulation"],"authors":["Daniel Kuhn"]}
