All of a sudden, the name DWF Labs was everywhere, pouring capital into projects that were struggling for funding in the wake of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186132\/ftx-collapse-timeline-six-days-that-rocked-the-crypto-industry\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX\u2019s collapse<\/a> and a wider market drought.","The company was seemingly splashing cash everywhere. Over the last year, it found $20 million for an investment deal with the Synthetix protocol, $28 million for blockchain platform Conflux, $40 million for AI platform Fetch.AI, $45 million for the EOS Network Foundation \u2014&nbsp;and a further $50 million for the Algorand Foundation. It now claims to have invested in 470 projects in total, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.foresightnews.pro\/foresight-interview-with-dwf-labs-founder-innovators-forge-ahead-leaving-the-old-hat-market-makers-behind\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Foresight News<\/a>, and worked with around <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ag_dwf\/status\/1729044331531731350\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">35% of the top 1,000 tokens<\/a> by market capitalization in its short 16-month history.&nbsp;","But for a young company to be throwing so much cash around, this raised questions as to how these deals were put together and whether everything was as it appeared.","In April, some of these questions were answered. Reports by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/225705\/dwf-labs-biggest-crypto-investors\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2023\/04\/14\/market-maker-dwf-labs-more-than-200m-in-deals-blur-what-investing-means\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinDesk<\/a> shed light on the way these deals were structured, revealing that, for the most part, they weren\u2019t traditional investment rounds but over-the-counter trades. Yet lingering questions remained over how DWF Labs conducts its business and how these trades and other deals are structured.&nbsp;","To understand more, The Block spoke with 16 clients, prospective clients and people with intimate knowledge of the company\u2019s operations. The Block analyzed 10 proposals and contracts between DWF Labs\u2019 clients and prospective clients, as well as communication between them. Key among the findings was that DWF Labs often talked about potential price movements when trying to get the attention of prospective clients, and indeed while working with clients.","DWF Labs declined to comment or be interviewed for this article.","Shortly after DWF Labs was launched in September 2022,&nbsp;the trading firm created a pitch deck for prospective clients. Obtained and verified by The Block, the pitch deck made considerable mention of price action.&nbsp;","Under a section called \u201CPrice Management,\u201D the pitch deck stated the trading firm can synchronize its efforts with the prospective client\u2019s marketing team to help the token\u2019s price respond to relevant events.","Later in the deck, it explained how this is done. \u201CBefore or during important scheduled news events the algorithms can be skewed to prefer one side of the orderbook and that is used to drive price upwards,\u201D the deck stated.&nbsp;","\u201CAs this is done on a passive orderbook level and not by actively creating artificial volume the growth of the token's price looks authentic,\u201D it added. \u201CNote that although DWF can provide artificial volume, it is hardly necessary due to the competitive pricing.\u201D","This type of language would continue for some time. For a while, DWF Labs\u2019 boilerplate language for its proposals to clients explained that the company would use its market-making services and its own funds to trade the client\u2019s token, improving the token\u2019s market. It said this would lead to \u201Cbullish sentiment, organic trading activities and price improvements.\u201D The Block has seen one proposal sent to a prospective client that contained this wording and a source directly familiar with the matter confirmed that it was used on multiple proposals.","This was also conveyed in verbal conversations. A prospective client told The Block that a DWF Labs employee pointed to graphs showing token price increases following previous partnerships when trying to get their business in the last few months. A source directly familiar with the matter said that on calls with prospective clients, if they were hesitant, a certain DWF Labs executive would start referencing token price increases for projects it had worked with previously.","This was the case in written conversations too. A different prospective client provided messages from a DWF Labs executive earlier this year confirming they were offering to boost their token\u2019s price. Separately, one of its clients provided messages from earlier this year that show DWF Labs Managing Partner Andrei Grachev asking how high the client would like their token\u2019s price to be raised and discussing whether the company could deliver on this. The Telegram handles for both executives were confirmed as authentic by the company\u2019s own <a href=\"https:\/\/verify.dwf-labs.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">verification checker<\/a>.","More recently, the company appears to have phased out this kind of price management-related language in writing, at least in pitch decks, according to two separate documents provided to two prospective clients pitched over the last few months.","DWF Labs focuses on three types of deals: liquid token investments, locked token investments and market-making arrangements \u2014 and it will often package these together.","For liquid token investments, DWF Labs will typically try to purchase a certain number of tokens with stablecoins at a 5-15% discount to the prevailing market price, according to the terms of three deals seen by The Block. The purchases take place in daily tranches of around $100,000-150,000 over a month or a few months with the purchases made at the token\u2019s price at the start of each day, minus the discount.","This means that project founders were able to effectively cash out through DWF Labs \u2014 at a slight premium \u2014 while touting that the project was receiving a large investment.","\u201CThe OTC desk became a godsend to many smaller projects because they could get rid of their tokens, attach themselves to a bigger name, say they got investment and extend their runway,\u201D said a person with direct knowledge of DWF Labs\u2019 operations.&nbsp;","One of DWF Labs\u2019 clients said this was exactly why they worked with the company. They said the relationship was a good way to offload tokens without selling them directly on the market.","In a previous interview with The Block, Grachev \u2014 who <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ag_dwf\/status\/1719301142117540207\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">asked<\/a> to be referred to as the \u201CNotorious AG\u201D for this article \u2014 cast doubt on this idea, saying that the trading firm moving funds to crypto exchanges did not mean the company was immediately selling the tokens.&nbsp;","\u201CWe transfer coins to exchanges but we never dump it and I would say that most of the transactions we did last month, or even more, we haven\u2019t sold them yet&nbsp;\u2014 maybe a small, small part,\u201D he said, during the interview in April. Grachev declined to be interviewed for this article.","An issue that had caused controversy was that DWF Labs\u2019 token purchases were often announced in advance, even though they may not get completed later on. In response to this backlash, the company has reportedly altered its strategy.","\u201CWe have learned a lot since the first half of this year,\u201D Grachev told BlockBeats, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockbeats.info\/news\/45416?from=telegram\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in an interview<\/a>. \u201CWe won't announce anything that hasn't been completed yet. If we announce something, it's already done.\u201D","For market-making services, DWF Labs will often provide its services over a year, according to two proposals to prospective clients and one contract with a client seen by The Block. This may involve taking loans in the project\u2019s token, as shown by the two proposals.&nbsp;","When taking loans, according to the two proposals, the company will have call options that it can exercise to buy the project\u2019s tokens at the price when the agreements are signed, a common feature of market-making contracts. These options can be exercised if the token\u2019s price reaches a certain level, known as the strike price. This is designed to protect the market maker from losses incurred when repaying the loan if the token\u2019s price rises while the services are being provided.&nbsp;","\u201CA market maker has to show both bids and asks. For downside protection they have to choose projects that they are comfortable to hold exposure in. For upside protection they need the strike price,\u201D said Jordi Alexander, CIO at Selini Capital. He added that strike prices are usually close to the token price but can be slightly above.","According to two people familiar with other crypto market-making firms, these strike prices are usually set up to 100% higher than the token\u2019s starting price.","For DWF Labs, however, the strike prices are set as high as many multiples of the token\u2019s price, according to the terms of the two proposals. This means if the token\u2019s price rises substantially, DWF Labs has the potential to make a higher percentage return.","\u201CIf you\u2019re a market maker, you want tokens to increase in price. You make money on options on how you price these tokens in a year\u2019s time,\u201D said a person directly familiar with the company\u2019s operations. \u201CYou want to be able to exercise the options at a lower price than what you priced them. That\u2019s where the money is generated.\u201D","In one market-making proposal, DWF Labs specified that it would help to promote the project\u2019s announcements and increase engagement with its community. Internally, this was a big focus. The company would tell employees when announcements were coming and encourage staff to post about them in order to keep up the momentum and \u201Cstrike while it's hot,\u201D this person familiar with the matter said.","But its external communication hasn\u2019t always been so clear. One of DWF Labs\u2019 clients said the company gave scant details on market-making services that had been provided, unlike other crypto market-making firms. \u201CUsually you get a detailed report back. With them it's not as detailed. To be honest we don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re doing with the tokens,\u201D they said. One contract with another client seen by The Block states DWF Labs has the ability to determine what information it provides in such reports.","Another client said they didn\u2019t receive a report from DWF Labs about market-making services they were engaged in. The client had to reach out to the relevant crypto exchange to get confirmation that the services were indeed being provided, which they did receive.","As for locked token investments on the venture capital side, the trading firm will typically seek much larger discounts, up to 50%, with a one or two-year lock-up, according to a client and two proposals to different prospective clients. Here it will also pay in stablecoins.","As all of these deals took place, DWF Labs kept ramping up its operations and expanding its reach across the industry. It has also doubled down on some of its partnerships, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@DWF-research\/dwf-labs-has-launched-two-validator-nodes-on-the-ton-blockchain-92426d95192e\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">running validator nodes<\/a> on the TON blockchain. In written comments to The Block, some of its industry partners said they were pleased with the outcome.","The Algorand Foundation said its $50 million transaction was an OTC trade that involved DWF Labs purchasing tranches of the ALGO token over time and was completed in July 2023. \u201CAt no stage during our negotiations with DWF was there a suggestion of them moving the market or providing artificial volume,\u201D said Eric Wragge, global head of business development and capital markets at the Algorand Foundation.","DWF Labs\u2019 deal with the EOS Network Foundation involved a purchase of $45 million of EOS tokens and a $15 million commitment to invest in EOS-based businesses and its ecosystem. EOS Network Foundation CEO Yves La Rose said, \u201COur strategic partnership with DWF has been exceptionally productive, resulting in a significant expansion of our ecosystem through cross-collaboration and financial investments. We eagerly anticipate the continued success and growth in 2024.\u201D","\u201CWe are very happy with our partnership with them,\u201D said B, a core team member of memecoin project Floki, which sold $5 million of tokens to DWF Labs. \u201COn an institutional level they have been immensely helpful: opening up access to their network, helping to facilitate exchange listings and connections with their portfolio partners, and just overall pushing our brand and offering support. They have a really good and professional team, too. They respond to our requests usually within minutes almost 24\/7, and often we have Andrei himself responding and pushing things.\u201D","Synthetix declined to comment for this article. Conflux and Fetch.ai did not respond when asked for comment. There is no suggestion that any of the crypto projects mentioned in this article had conversations about price management with DWF Labs.","For all the controversy surrounding DWF Labs, the company and those close to it show no signs of slowing down. In September, HTX (formerly known as Huobi) handed Digital Wave Finance <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ag_dwf\/status\/1702220742388318501?t=4lMw1c5KWF7g8Cl-bsZdeQ&amp;s=19\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an award<\/a> for being its best partner.

It has already applied for a virtual asset service provider license in the British Virgin Islands, according to his interview with BlockBeats.","Going ahead, the company is starting an inaugural <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DWFLabs\/status\/1729711815310053842\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">incubation program<\/a> for crypto companies and it plans to create what Grachev <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ag_dwf\/status\/1725526428358254855\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">described<\/a> as a compliant market for crypto OTC trades \u2014 which could put it in a pivotal position among crypto traders.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Grachev posted a photograph of a Lamborghini branded with the DWF Labs logo.
