The Ethereum blockchain depends on 606,947 validators to confirm transactions made on the network, per BeaconScan, but each of those individually might be seen as a point of failure.","What\u2019s more, the validators themselves can be subject to stiff financial penalties known as \u201Cslashing\u201D when they go offline for extended periods. So the validators also have an incentive to increase their own resiliency.","This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.","So the idea is that the validators themselves can become decentralized.","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has listed distributed validators among the blockchain\u2019s top priorities since at least 2021, when he wished the Beacon Chain happy birthday and provided an updated roadmap for the second largest blockchain by market capitalization, notable for its smart contracts.","DVT has attracted more discussion and development focus in recent months among entrepreneurs and crypto analysts at firms including Messari, Coin Metrics, Bankless, Wu Blockchain and Pantera Capital.","Under the technology, a validator\u2019s private key \u2013 used to sign on-chain operations like block proposals and attestations \u2013 can be split across several node operators. As a result, the duties and responsibilities of a validator can be distributed and shared across a cluster of node operators, instead of a single node.","Distributed validator technology \u201Callows you to have multiple parties running a single validator,\u201D said staking service provider P2P\u2019s head of Research Steven Quinn to CoinDesk. \u201CFrom a technical perspective, what that means is you can geographically distribute the machines.\u201D","The 2021 roadmap, while not entirely complete, shows Ethereum\u2019s trajectory of where it\u2019s been and where it\u2019s going, delineating different eras of current and future development.","Currently, Ethereum is still in the first era, titled, \u201CThe Merge,\u201D even though Ethereum has successfully shifted to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, completely overhauling its system for processing transactions.","What\u2019s left among the key milestones in the current era is the deployment of distributed validators, which is on its way thanks to two open-source networks: Obol and SSV.","Obol Network is \u201Cresponsible for fostering the adoption of multi-operator validation as a use case for Distributed Validator Technology,\u201D as stated on its homepage, and SSV.Network \u201Cenables the distributed operation of an Ethereum validator across varying operators,\u201D according to a blog post.","Currently, each Ethereum validator runs on a single node, and both Obol and SSV see this as a single point of failure in the validation process. If a node operator goes offline and becomes unavailable for whatever reason like an infrastructure bug in the validator\u2019s client, then the validator wouldn\u2019t be able to conduct its responsibilities, such as proposing blocks and attesting.","As a result, the validator would incur a slashing penalty for their staked ether. Obol and SSV are attempting to remove this single point of failure in the validation process.","In regards to DVT, Messari research analyst Stephanie Dunbar told CoinDesk, \u201CWhat I\u2019m most excited about is the idea of increasing resiliency on Ethereum and in the future, potentially on other blockchains as well.\u201D","DVT\u2019s importance lies in making the Ethereum blockchain more resilient, defined as Ethereum being able to \u201Cwithstand external and internal disturbances - this can be from geopolitics, regulation, markets or even less intuitive disruptions like fires or earthquakes,\u201D Walter Smith from technology-driven investment firm Galaxy to CoinDesk over email.","With more clients and node operators in different geographical areas running a single validator, even if several node operators experience downtime as a result of a malicious actor or a bug in the codebase, the entire validator wouldn\u2019t go down since a significant portion of the network is using distributed validator technology.","\u201CShould <33% of the participating nodes in a DV cluster go offline, the remaining active nodes can still come to consensus on what to sign and can produce valid signatures for their staking duties,\u201D per Obol docs.","Distributed validator technology represents the last critical development in Ethereum\u2019s Merge era before \u201CThe Surge,\u201D as Obol and SSV have been gearing up to bring distributed validators to Ethereum mainnet.","SSV is in its last step before its mainnet launch, with the introduction of its public testnet Jato in March, and Obol had started deploying distributed validators on Ethereum mainnet in April.","DVT \u201Cmakes the heart of the crypto universe - Ethereum - more robust, more decentralized and more credibly neutral, opening its protocols and uses to all in a more stable manner,\u201D according to Smith.","Edited by Bradley Keoun."],"entity":[{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Steven Quinn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"33%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bradley Keoun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankless","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Pantera Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Walter Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Stephanie Dunbar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Distributed Validator Technology","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SSV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wu Blockchain","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Validators","Protocols","Staking","Decentralization"],"authors":["Sage D.
