It also enables wallet providers using the implementation to abstract away the distinction between users\u2019 on-chain bitcoin and Lightning Network balances through unified wallets \u2014 making the distinction largely irrelevant.","\"One of the biggest pain points for Lightning users is unreliable transaction throughput \u2014 channel liquidity constraints are a big part of the equation there,\" Blockstream developer Lisa Neigut said in a statement. \"Splicing is an incredible new tool for alleviating liquidity constraints, which should result in making transactions significantly cheaper and more reliable for users.\"","The Lightning Network is a second-layer solution of bi-directional payment channels built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, designed to enable fast and low-cost transactions. Lightning implementations refer to the various software projects that build and maintain interoperable versions of the Lightning Network protocol used by node operators, app developers and wallet providers, among others.&nbsp;","Core Lightning is one of four popular Lightning implementations alongside Lightning Labs' Lightning Network Daemon, ACINQ's Eclair and Lightning Development Kit \u2014 developed by Spiral, a subsidiary of Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block.","\"The goal is to make wallets 'just work' instead of users having to bear the brunt of managing different account balances for different protocols,\" independent Core Lightning contributor Dusty Daemon said. \"In the future, everyday users won\u2019t need to understand the difference between Lightning and bitcoin \u2014 these protocols will simply be 'spliced' together on the backend.\"","Dusty Daemon developed Splicing as an independent developer, collaborating with Blockstream engineers Lisa Neigut and Rusty Russell, as well as ACINQ's CTO Bastien Teinturier, according to the statement. His work on Splicing is funded by private grants, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/opensats.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent<\/a> contribution from the Jack Dorsey-backed Bitcoin-focused non-profit OpenSats.","Core Lightning\u2019s upgrade follows ACINQ Eclair's <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ACINQ\/eclair\/blob\/master\/docs\/release-notes\/eclair-v0.9.0.md\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">release<\/a> of a custom prototype for Splicing in June. ACINQ's Bitcoin Lightning wallet Phoenix <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239098\/phoenix-wallet-lightning\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">integrated<\/a> the Splicing feature in July, enabling it to reduce fees on receiving Bitcoin payments from 1% to just miner fees and a transparent 0.4% fixed rather than variable fee for sending Lightning payments.","Phoenix's Splicing technology allows users to add or remove funds from a single dynamic channel without incurring future risk as it can be priced at the current cost, ACINQ said at the time.","Self-custodial Bitcoin Lightning wallet Mutiny, which reached its public beta phase in July also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239615\/mutiny-normie-ready-lighting-wallet-avoiding-apple-google-app-stores\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> a unified wallet was the end goal, adding that when Splicing becomes more widely available it would help solve the complexities of unified balances.","Last month, the Lightning Network hit a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236315\/lightning-network-capacity\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">record-high<\/a> capacity of 5,640 BTC ($175 million) before falling back, according to The Block's data dashboard.
