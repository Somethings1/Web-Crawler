The firm chose the two countries over other Asian countries because of its \u201Cvibrant\u201D cryptocurrency ecosystem and \u201Cclear\u201D regulatory framework, Dr. James Smith, co-founder and CEO of Elliptic, told The Block. The new offices will serve as a base to serve clients throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Smith added.","Elliptic said its revenues from Asia-based clients have increased 11x over the past two years. When asked for specific figures, Smith declined to disclose them. He also did not comment on the firm's current valuation or total funding to date.","According to Crunchbase, Elliptic has<a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/elliptic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> raised<\/a> $12 million to date.

It built anti-money laundering (AML) compliance software and started offering forensic and investigative services to detect and prevent cryptocurrency-enabled crimes.","Elliptic said that today over 100 cryptocurrency businesses and financial institutions globally use its solutions to screen \u201Cbillions of dollars\u201D in transactions every day and to analyze them for links to illicit activities such as money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions evasion.","Yoshitaka Kitao, representative director president and CEO of SBI Holdings, said: \u201CWe are seeing a growing demand for [Elliptic\u2019s] services across our portfolio of crypto-assets related companies.\u201D With SBI as a lead investor, Elliptic will be able to \u201Cdouble down\u201D on its mission to \u201Cenable the crypto industry to grow and take shape,\" said Smith.","Elliptic has also doubled the size of its team this year, mainly in its London and New York offices, Smith told The Block, adding: \u201CWe will continue to expand these teams in key areas such as customer success, product and marketing, as well as expanding our presence in Japan and Singapore.\u201D","Smith further said that the firm does not plan to raise any more funds in the near future as the latest round gives it \u201Can excellent foundation for the next growth stage\u201D and provides what it needs to meet its overall goals."],"hashtag":[]}
