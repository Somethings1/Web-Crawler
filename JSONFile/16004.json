Ultimately, DLT could cut costs for issuers, investors, bond arrangers and custodians, the bank said.","HSBC is already deep in the blockchain and DLT space, having launched numerous projects involving the tech and often speaking out in advocacy. Last year the bank warned that \"digital islands\" could inhibit global blockchain-based trade. An exec also called on the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to make more \u201Cpositive noise\u201D about DLT to encourage reluctant businesses into using the tech.","While all this seems extremely bullish on the technology, Tony Cripps, HSBC Singapore CEO, argued that DLT's potential to reduce inefficiencies in the fixed income market still has to be determined. \"Only by collaborating with market participants will we fully understand its actual viability,\" he said.","\"Having HSBC and Temasek on board will enable us to evaluate holistically whether smart contracts and DLT can solve some of the long-standing challenges in the fixed income issuance ecosystem,\u201D said Lee Beng Hong, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at SGX.","HSBC Singapore image via Shutterstock"],"entity":[{"type":"HSBC Singapore","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"HSBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"HSBC Singapore CEO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tony Cripps","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SGX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Temasek","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shutterstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DLT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lee Beng Hong","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Singapore","Banking","HSBC","News","capital markets","Bonds","SGX","Tokenized Securities","business news"],"authors":["Daniel Palmer"]}
