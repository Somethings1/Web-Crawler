It is mainly meant for micro-transactions.","In other words, there is a cap on bitcoin withdrawals. \"For now, we are setting the limit at 0.000001 BTC to 0.05 BTC [$0.035 to $1,770],\" Hao told The Block.","For deposits, OKEx doesn't control the limit, \"but when you withdraw on another Lightning Network node to that deposit, that node will have similar limits,\" said Hao.","OKEx has partnered with Lightning Labs for the integration, meaning the exchange will become one of the nodes on the Lightning Network.","The network is made up of nodes to send and receive bitcoin from each other. These nodes open payment channels between them to increase the liquidity of the network. There are currently more than 8,600 nodes with payment channels, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinvisuals.com\/lightning\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a> from Bitcoin Visuals.","There is no specific date by when OKEx's integration with the network will be live, but Hao said it should be completed by March.","A number of crypto exchanges have announced support for the Lightning Network in recent weeks, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/92129\/okcoin-bitcoin-lightning-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OKCoin<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/88027\/kraken-lightning-network-bitcoin-integration\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kraken<\/a>. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, and a few other exchanges already support the feature.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
