The company, which was the exclusive cryptocurrency exchange sponsor for the game, asked the bankruptcy court overseeing FTX's case to force the failed crypto firm to end its contract with Riot, or if the exchange refuses, to allow Riot to terminate the agreement.","Doing so will cost the gaming company \u2014 $12 million per year over the seven years of the contract. Riot said it expected $12.5 million this year through the deal, but after FTX's bankruptcy, more than $6 million is in arrears. Allowing Riot to end the deal would also allow the gaming company to seek another cryptocurrency exchange as a sponsor.","But money appears to be the least of Riot's concerns.","\"There is simply no way for FTX to cure the reputational harm already caused to Riot as a result of the highly public disrepute wrought by the debacle preceding FTX\u2019s bankruptcy filing,\" The company said in its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. \"FTX cannot turn back the clock and undo the damage inflicted on Riot in the wake of its collapse.\"","Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF_FTX\/status\/1357123559273816064\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">touted<\/a> his affinity for the game on Twitter and in interviews, famously (or infamously) playing it during media interviews and even during a <a href=\"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/sam-bankman-fried-once-caught-183314308.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">venture capital funding round meeting<\/a>. And that's a problem for Riot.","\"Media outlets and Twitter commentators splashed images of Mr. Bankman-Fried playing League of Legends \u2014 Riot Games\u2019 game \u2014 at the same time that FTX was crashing,\" the company said in its court filing. \"He is well-known among investors to play League of Legends during meetings.\"","Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas earlier this week and denied bail while awaiting extradition to the U.S. A federal grand jury in New York indicted him on multiple charges of fraud. If convicted of all charges he faces up to 115 years in prison.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
