Cal, Filed 6\/5\/19, Document #219) (\u201CJOINT STATEMENT RE DISCOVERY DISPUTE\u201D) [NMR\/SDP]<\/strong><\/em><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nWe\u2019ve hit our next major milestone in the ongoing saga that is the Tezos Class Action litigation. Previously, SDP wrote about the lead plaintiff issue in CCM #31. Now we\u2019ve moved on to the discovery phase of the process and there is, of course \u2026 a dispute!","As a reminder, in case you\u2019ve slept through most of CCM, litigation in the United States allows the parties to do something called discovery, in which they can get the other side\u2019s documents, written responses to questions, and take depositions. No surprise, people sometimes disagree about the scope of appropriate discovery. This is bread and butter of litigators and honestly takes up more time for many than showing up in court and trying cases. It can be mind-numbingly dull but also sometimes wins and loses cases.","This particular dispute centers around what documents should the defendants in this case be required to produce. In particular, there\u2019s a timing dispute. The plaintiffs want all relevant documents for particular requests, regardless of their creation date, and the defendants do not want that. In fact, the defendants think that only documents created on or before Nov. 26, 2017, the date the first Tezos class action lawsuit was filed should be produced.","This particular document was jointly filed by the plaintiffs and the defendants, because of a court requirement that the parties try to work out their fights between themselves and where they can\u2019t to submit a single document to the court explaining their competing positions. The plaintiffs argue that certain documents, such as for example, anything related to discussions with regulators, are relevant to their case in that they help establish that the Tezos ICO was a securities offering under the Howey Test. The defendants counter that under the plaintiff\u2019s own theory of the case, that the Tezos ICO was a securities offering, the plaintiffs\u2019 request should be denied. As the defendants explain:","\"the Ninth Circuit has held that the inquiry should be 'determined at the time of issuance, rather than at some subsequent time.' Danner v. Himmelfarb, 858 F.2d 515, 520 (9th Cir. 1988); see also Gallagher v. Roberts, 2017 WL 1365792, at *5 (S.D. Cal. April 14, 2017) (granting motion to dismiss where complaint failed to allege an expectation of profits \u201Cat the time of the offer and sale of the alleged security\u201D). In other words, only the facts that existed at the time of the purported offering are relevant under Plaintiff\u2019s own theory.","The defendants continue this line of argument closing the loop by saying:","\"The Howey test focuses on 'the terms of the [alleged] offer, the plan of distribution, and the economic inducements held out to the prospect.\u201D SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 352\u201353 (1943); see also Warfield v. Alaniz, 569 F.3d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir. 2009) (courts \u201Cmust focus [the] inquiry on what the purchasers were offered or promised\u201D and will \u201Cconduct an objective inquiry into the character of the instrument or transaction offered based on what the purchasers were \u2018led to expect.\u2019\u201D).<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nPlaintiffs also argue that \u201Cdocuments post-dating November 26, 2017 would clearly be relevant to the entrepreneurial and\/or managerial efforts of Defendants in making Tezos tokens profitable.' Defendants counter that this is a \u201Cfishing expedition\u201D and that all that matters are documents in existence at the time of the 'fundraisers.' (They\u2019re consistent, thematically, by the way\u200A\u2014\u200ATezos defendants\u2019 pleadings always say fundraiser; plaintiffs refer to it as an ICO).\"","As usual, both sides try to put their best foot forward. The party asking for the documents accuses the other side of being obstructionist. The opposing party says it\u2019s an overly burdensome fishing expedition. Exactly so here. The next step will be for the magistrate judge in this case in charge of discovery to rule on this dispute, and for actual discovery to commence.
