They claim to be a whitehat hacker and have offered to return 80% of the funds that they took.","This hacker said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0xb5637fd9511ac9970070939abb073a13551f82c4c2e2c77814e9b82c7309e801\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blockchain transaction<\/a>, \"whitehat here, send me the tx you lost your weth, I give 80% back.

When asked if this hacker also owned the wallet that stole $1.43 million through this exploit, Multichain told The Block that it was possible. Be'ery said, \"C<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">annot really know.<\/span>\"","Multichain is a cross-chain protocol for swapping tokens across blockchains. The existence of the Multichain bug was first revealed by the project itself on January 17. While the project said it had fixed the bug, which affected six tokens including wrapped ether (WETH), it still impacted previous users of the protocol.","Anyone who had used the protocol previously needed to revoke permissions to the application in order to keep their funds safe from this specific attack. Despite Multichain's warning, many users failed to do so.","Yesterday, the Multichain team <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TalBeerySec\/status\/1483550455536005135\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reached out<\/a> to the original address (that stole $1.43 million) via a message in a blockchain transaction. The message stated that the project offers a bounty for exploits, implying the hacker should give the funds back and receive a bounty. So far, that message has not seen a direct response.","One user who lost nearly $1 million in the hack, is offering the person who stole those funds 50 ETH ($156,000) as a tip if they return the rest, as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TalBeerySec\/status\/1483903235144441862\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noticed by<\/a> Be'ery.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: This story has been updated with the latest figure for the Multichain hack.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["CRYPTO"]}
