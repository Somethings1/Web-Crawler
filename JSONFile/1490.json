With the demand for a bitcoin ETF now proven, many wonder what a Canadian approval could mean for a U.S. offering.&nbsp;","The Scoop spoke with Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, about what an approved bitcoin ETF means for the landscape. During this week's episode Balchunas broke down the winding road to approval and why Canada was always likely to be a first.","Now that Canada has its BTC ETFs, he argued that an approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is just around the corner.","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b>\"I think it's just a matter of the SEC coming around, and then once they come around mentally, I imagine it will happen pretty quickly,\" he said. \"But again, I'm not in that bubble. I'm not a regulatory analyst. That's just my sense from talking to people.\"","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
