The Zelle co-founder is bringing his experience in the digital payment field to grow the Stellar network as the CEO of Interstellar, a for-profit company developing payment protocols on the Stellar network.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Interstellar was born out of a 2018 acquisition deal between Lightyear.io, a startup built on the Stellar protocol, and decentralized ledger technology builder Chain. At the time, the company stated that it aimed to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/interstellar\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">provide<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> enterprise solutions for adopting the Stellar blockchain, developed by the non-profit Stellar Development Foundation (SDF).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Interstellar is growing the network by building out the payment layer on Stellar, an area where Kennedy has extensive experience. The company has been connecting with various banks, licensed non-bank providers and companies, and building layers to entice a wider user base, according to Kennedy. This includes building projects that the SDF wouldn\u2019t. Right now, this means pivoting towards liquidity and market making capabilities, something Kennedy said industry players continue to call for.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThat\u2019s not something that makes sense for a nonprofit like the Stellar Development Foundation to do,\u201D he said. \u201CHowever, it is something that would really help to drive growth and adoption of the network beyond the rates that we\u2019re seeing today, and so that\u2019s one of the things that we will likely do with Interstellar.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2011, Kennedy founded Zelle, a peer-to-peer payments system that was later adopted by almost all major banks in the U.S., including Bank of America, Chase and Morgan Stanley.

But Kennedy said the real giant to take on was PayPal, which had existed for a decade prior.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Now at Interstellar, Kennedy plans to take on similar giants \u2013 the SWIFT payment system and correspondent banking. Most traditional finance institutions utilize these mechanisms to transfer money internationally, but Kennedy said blockchain can do it faster, more reliably and at a lower cost.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThat's where the majority of dollars are going through for international payments today is the traditional SWIFT and correspondent banking, and we clearly have a much better solution that I think we\u2019re going to get everyone to realize and adopt,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kennedy will replace Adam Ludwin, the current CEO of the blockchain payments startup Interstellar and a former RRE Ventures partner. Meanwhile, Ludwin will go on to helm the company\u2019s latest spin-off, Pogo, a subsidiary that will focus on apps and mobile wallets. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kennedy\u2019s appointment at Interstellar follows the news that investment fund Franklin Templeton <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/38357\/franklin-templeton-proposes-tokenized-government-money-market-fund-on-stellar-network\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">plans<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to tokenize the share of a government money market fund on the Stellar network.
