The protocol is built using the Polygon Chain Development Kit (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247873\/polygon-labs-chain-development-kit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CDK<\/a>), which enables the development of purpose-built, zero knowledge-powered Layer 2 blockchains on Ethereum.","\u201CWe are thrilled to see Libre select Polygon CDK\u2019s scalability and security to revolutionize the alternative investments space,\u201D Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal said. \u201CLibre demonstrates the immense potential of blockchain technology to unlock new opportunities for investors globally.\"","Libre founder Dr. Avtar Sehra has been working on real-world asset tokenization since 2014, first on Bitcoin, then Ethereum, having previously founded the UK FCA-licensed tokenization platform Nivaura. Additional use cases for the protocol include services such as collateralized lending and automated rebalancing of private investment portfolios.","\"While our MVP objective is to increase AUM by launching the primary issuance service and driving distributor integrations, we are also working closely with our partners and clients on our 2024 product roadmap, which includes collateralized lending and automated portfolio rebalancing \u2014 building the future of wealth APIs,\" Sehra said.","Libre is scheduled to go live in Q1 2024, with investment management firms Brevan Howard and Hamilton Lane set to become the first issuers to use the platform amid growing interest from the industry to leverage blockchain technology to enhance the ways in which alternative asset funds can be distributed and accessed.","\"We believe that tokenization has the potential to revolutionize the way investments are managed and traded, and are focused on strategically partnering with other leading firms to improve compliance and streamline access to the private markets through initiatives like Libre,\u201D Hamilton Lane Head of Digital Assets Victor Jung said.","\u201CThe tokenization of funds allows us to offer investors a new way to access our strategies, providing them with optionality, and further develops our platform to serve client needs. It is for this reason that we have been deeply involved in Libre,\u201D Brevan Howard Head of Strategy Natalie Smith added.","Libre is not the only project working on the tokenization of funds.
