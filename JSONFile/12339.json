Some major miners, such as 6Block \u2014 which possesses about over 10% of the network\u2019s mining power via several miner IDs \u2014 have not added any new effective storage over the past few days.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Li Bai, a core developer at 6Block, said in an interview that the network\u2019s total effective mining power had grown by just around 10 PiB in the past day to reach the current level of 597 PiB and that the growth has already flattened. He said Filecoin's economic incentive mechanism is the reason behind what appears to be a power growth standoff.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Filecoin\u2019s current design requires miners to pledge 0.1901 FIL \u2013 the network\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 as collateral for sealing 32 gibibyte (GiB) of data that can be further converted into effective storage mining power, according to Filecoin\u2019s blockchain explorer.

For Li at 6Block, a suitable strategy now is to wait and see how the market for FIL plays out.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s like pledging a spot FIL for getting a FIL in the future that\u2019s coming with linear inflation. For miners, it\u2019s just a matter of expectation for the rate of return of their spot FIL,\u201D said Li.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Asked if there was a collective strike in a coordinated fashion among Chinese Filecoin miners as described in local news reports, Li rejected that narrative.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s not a strike. It\u2019s just a better strategy given the current economics,\u201D he said. \u201CWith more potential sell pressure when there\u2019s no adequate circulating FIL at a steady price range, it\u2019s not lucrative to pledge a spot FIL for a future FIL whose price could be lower.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But still, the current economic model has sparked complaints from Filecoin miners \u2013 a majority of whom are Chinese companies \u2013 in the project\u2019s official Slack channel reviewed by The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In response to that, Protocol Labs, the organization behind Filecoin, has approved a revision to the current mechanism in an attempt to solve miners\u2019 liquidity issues.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to the FIP-0004 proposal <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/filecoin-project\/FIPs\/blob\/master\/FIPS\/fip-0004.md\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">published<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> on GitHub on Sunday, the plan is to \u201Cmake 25% of storage-mining rewards immediately available with no vesting\u201D while the remaining 75% will still be vested through 180 days linearly.
