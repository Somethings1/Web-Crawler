We are continually hearing reports and having phone calls with people in the space and infrastructure is hard to get right now,\" Wall said.","Core Scientific CEO Mike Levitt said that the company had not placed any machine orders so far in 2022 and was now in a good position to take advantage of a more favorable market.","\"We had a point of view that, in fact, there would be perhaps difficult times for all of these companies that had put in big orders and that there might be an opportunity to pick up units at better value in the future,\" Levitt said.&nbsp;","CleanSpark also announced a partnership with TMGcore to expand its immersion mining. The company will get 257 tanks, which fit 28 Antminer S19j each. Additionally, it will get 2 megawatts of colocation capacity at a TMGcore facility in Texas.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
