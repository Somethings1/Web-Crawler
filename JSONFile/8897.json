While bitcoin mining generates output in the form of bitcoin, AI computing would require establishing partnerships with companies engaged in AI-related activities, such as image and video rendering, with Bekbauov finding the AI industry more closed compared to the open culture of crypto.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI don't see any problems and to switch from mining to AI data centers. The only one is where to find customers,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSomeone potentially can buy GPUs in bulk and then start some AI computing on it,\" Bekbauov added. \"But again, with AI, you have to secure the demand side which will be using your computing power. You have to talk to companies like ChatGPT [Open AI] and others, especially AI companies working on pictures or videos, because they need a lot of computing power to render them. I think the software part of these companies is developing really fast, but the hardware part is the bottleneck.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Referring to his company Xive, which is currently a 100% bitcoin mining company with operations in Kazakhstan as well as Iowa and West Virginia in the United States, Bekbauov said it's \"interested, but we are not very familiar with how it works.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"On the technical side, we know how to build, how to supply everything, how to start these kinds of data centers,\" he said. \"But on the business side, we are still trying to find ways to establish deals with companies like OpenAI and offer them some of our computing power because there is a risk in terms of our business.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf we build everything, it requires a lot of capital for all these data centers. We have to first secure the demand side. We have to sign some kind of letter of intent with AI companies and then we can start building,\u201D he added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Xive isn\u2019t the only miner considering the move, with the similarly named <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239271\/crypto-miner-hive-joins-ai-bandwagon-dumps-blockchain-from-name\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hive<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> dropping \u201Cblockchain\u201D from its name this week to become Hive Digital Technologies.

He discussed the growing trend of hydro cooling solutions, where water is used to cool mining equipment instead of air or immersion fluid, with the resulting hot water repurposed for various heating solutions.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bekbauov cited examples of hydro-cooled mining farms being used to heat residential complexes, fish farms and even greenhouse projects.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI know one of the manufacturers who are already doing some heating projects in China. They are heating some residential apartments,\u201D Bekbauov said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hydro-cooled miners are also being used to \u201Cheat a fishing farm in Norway,\u201D Bekbauov added. \u201CThe farm is one of the top three salmon producers in the world, now using miners to heat their fish farms. It gives amazing results because if you just grow the salmon in the water with no heating, it takes five years to get big enough to be sold for commercial purposes. But if you increase the temperature of the water up to 10 degrees, then it takes only one and half years,\u201D he continued.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bekbauov said he had also seen some greenhouse projects that use this heated water to warm greenhouses.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While acknowledging the complexity and higher maintenance requirements of hydro cooling setups compared to traditional air cooling and other solutions, Bekbauov said the benefits derived from combining hydro mining with other businesses in terms of heat utilization.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bekbauov, who began his mining journey in 2018 with a baptism of fire heading into the bear market, acknowledged that bitcoin mining had become a game for big players with substantial capital and access to cheap electricity, especially in the U.S.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, he added that smaller-scale mining operations, such as home miners and individual enthusiasts, still exist in regions with cheap enough electricity, noting that these miners are incentivized to continue due to their cost advantages and the ability to manage operations efficiently.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CBitcoin will never die, even if bitcoin mining is banned everywhere. We will still have home miners,\u201D Bekbauov said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bekbauov also highlighted countries like Paraguay, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates that offer comparative advantages with their affordable electricity rates, potentially attracting new mining companies.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While regulatory challenges exist, Bekbauov, who <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">also acts as a mentor at the Founder Institute startup accelerator program in Houston,<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> noted the lobbying efforts of mining companies and the favorable regulatory environment in countries like the U.S. where bitcoin's decentralized nature aligned with its values of freedom.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere is some concern because in Kazakhstan we faced some bad regulations. But in the U.S. there is a lobby of miners,\u201D Bekbauov said. \u201CEven Biden said he recently wanted to tax miners 30% for electricity, and there was a lot of debate around it and a lot of public mining companies made statements saying that it would destroy the local crypto economy and mean they would have to consider moving. And then [the administration] just stopped promoting it. So, in the U.S. it's good because there are a lot of big companies who are protecting good regulations, like Coinbase.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIn 2017, I remember my biggest fear was, what if bitcoin will be banned everywhere and the price goes to zero? That was my main concern. Now, I don't even believe that bitcoin can ever go to zero,\u201D Bekbauov added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bekbauov also pointed to more friendly regulatory environments in Hong Kong and Dubai \u2014 where Xive plans to expand next, after building out a facility in Kyrgyzstan. \u201CDubai and Hong Kong have already implemented very good regulations. So many companies are considering moving there, particularly to Dubai,\u201D Bekbauov said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bekbauov said he was very excited about the future of bitcoin after <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235056\/blackrock-takes-giant-leap-toward-spot-bitcoin-etf-with-sec-filing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlackRock\u2019s<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> recent spot bitcoin ETF filing, having passed a period of uncertainty.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI believe, now we have passed this uncertain period of time, where people were still thinking about what the future of bitcoin would be,\u201D Bekbauov said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI'm quite confident, the future of bitcoin is bright,\" he continued. \"We are in the right industry at the right time. Many people still don't know much about bitcoin so we are still early adopters.
