FTX.US, notably, never got a BitLicense and consequently couldn\u2019t legally operate in New York.","\"They had an application pending, which they noted publicly. And it was pending,\u201D Harris said, when asked about FTX.US' status by Aaron Klein, a Brookings senior fellow.&nbsp;","\u201CI want to acknowledge first and foremost that FTX.US was not operating in New York,\u201D said Marton, the NYDFS\u2019 virtual currency chief, in a separate panel.&nbsp;","The NYDFS BitLicense regime is one of the most stringent in the country, making it a frequent subject of criticism from industry.","Recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/170664\/biden-administration-takes-a-step-closer-towards-a-digital-dollar\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposals<\/a> for federal regulatory changes around digital assets include developing a federal payments license, instead of the current state-by-state money transmitter licensing that firms, including crypto firms, have to follow.

Those proposals may allow at least some crypto companies to go to a federal license instead of state licensing like the BitLicense.&nbsp;","Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of Better Markets, criticized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/183928\/crypto-d-c-influence-spending-levels-off-after-massive-boom-year\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto lobbying in Washington, D.C.<\/a>, saying \u201Cthe crypto industry has been banging on the door using their political allies as battering rams, to smash the regulators.\u201D He added that FTX and others pushing for a greater role in crypto regulation for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were&nbsp; trying to \u201Cbuy the weakest regulator they could capture.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
