This is evident in projects like the Bank of Thailand and Bank of Brazil's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/251008\/swift-central-banks-cbdc-test\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CBDC initiatives<\/a> and the Bank for International Settlements-led mCBDC bridge project, which are using Hyperledger Besu to build on, Taurus said.","Taurus' expansion follows its partnership with the banking giant Deutsche Bank last week, enabling Germany's largest bank \u2014 which manages over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1245429\/leading-banks-total-assets-germany\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u20AC1.3 trillion<\/a> ($1.4 trillion) in assets \u2014 to provide digital asset custody and tokenization services to its institutional clients.","\"As the digital asset space is expected to encompass trillions of dollars of assets, it\u2019s bound to be seen as one of the priorities for investors and corporations alike,\" Deutsche Bank Global Head of Securities Services Paul Maley said at the time. \"As such, custodians must start adapting to support their clients.\"","The collaboration followed Deutsche Bank\u2019s participation in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/211162\/taurus-crypto-series-b-credit-suisse\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Taurus' $65 million Series B<\/a> funding round and its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235590\/deutsche-bank-applies-for-digital-asset-license-with-german-regulator-bloomberg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">application for a digital asset license<\/a> with Germany\u2019s financial regulator BaFin earlier this year.","Â© 2023 The Block.
