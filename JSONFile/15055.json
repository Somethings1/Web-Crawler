The exchange, which plans to close its U.S. platform on April 30, said it would take the regulator to court if the agency did not make a \u201Creasonable settlement offer.\u201D","Gottlieb said crypto companies may try to hold off the SEC using the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that regulators can\u2019t exceed their authority. The high court last used the doctrine in 2022 in a 6-3 decision involving the Environmental Protection Agency on whether it had the authority to issue an emissions cap on greenhouse gases.","Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, said no, and that it was up to Congress to provide EPA with clear authorization for such actions.","\u201CWhat the Supreme Court has instructed is that administrative agencies, which are a branch of the executive department, are not allowed to take views that will affect major questions of the United States economy,\u201D Gottlieb said.","So when it comes to crypto, \u201CThat\u2019s for Congress to set the law, not for the SEC to say 'we believe the law should be no crypto,'\u201D he added.","The U.S. approach to crypto \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 is going to have a big effect on this country\u2019s economic and financial competitiveness. Consider other jurisdictions, Gottlieb said, such as the European Union, the U.K., Singapore, Japan and the Cayman Islands, which \u201Care developing legal regimes that can allow people to operate legally.\u201D","While these regimes may not be perfect, and are likely to have advantages and disadvantages, Gottlieb said that, unlike the U.S., they all have \u201Ca clear path [for a crypto company] to operate legally.\u201D","On Tuesday, during Fintech Week in London, CEO Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, said the exchange could consider moving offshore if the regulatory environment for the crypto industry does not become more clear.","That isn\u2019t the approach all crypto companies are taking, Gottlieb said. Hs crypto clients are asking him what can be done to operate legally in the U.S., or as close as possible to legal given the ambiguities, he said.","\u201CWe try to tell our clients as best we can what the law requires [and] what regulators require,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd sometimes, we have to tell you, sorry, it can\u2019t happen here.\u201D","See also: Coinbase Could Move Away From U.S. if No Regulatory Clarity: CEO Brian Armstrong","CORRECTION (April 19, 2023, 0:34 UTC): Changes multiple references from Cohen to Gottlieb.","Edited by Lawrence Lewitinn."],"entity":[{"type":"Cayman Islands","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gottlieb","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fintech Week","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cohen","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Brian Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"John Roberts","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 19, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"3","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"European Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Supreme Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"First Mover\u201D","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jason Gottlieb","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Morrison Cohen LLP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Environmental Protection Agency","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EPA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lawrence Lewitinn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the Supreme Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Policy","crypto regulation","SEC","Bittrex","Coinbase","Congress","cdtv","Morrison Cohen LLP"],"authors":["Fran Velasquez"]}
