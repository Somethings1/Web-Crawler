Questions have also arisen about the number of successful decentralized applications or 'DApps' in the ecosystem when compared to networks.","Hoskinson says that this sentiment reflects a misunderstanding about what is being developed on Cardano.","\"There's almost 200 DApps that are under construction right now,\" he noted. \"SundaeSwap is one of the most prominent, it's launching tomorrow,\" referring to the DEX that launched Thursday \u2014 albeit with congestion issues that resulted in some transactions taking longer than expected to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InputOutputHK\/status\/1484301683303800843?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">complete<\/a>.","\"There are several already running on the ecosystem,\" Hoskinson clarified. \"And, you know, smart contract support technically started just in September of last year.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Looking to the future, Hoskinson believes that Cardano can continue to become more decentralized as it grows over time, noting that if its valuation ever hit bitcoin's it would have \"tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of stake pools running the system or complemented by tons of validators inside the system.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the future, Cardano could even continue to exist without the participation of the Wyoming resident. \"T<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">he founders are important because they get the party started and they set the initial state of the system.\" <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He went on to add:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"I think that you have to plan for obsolescence, you have to plan to fire yourself.
