Kwon has had significant disagreements with the wider Cosmos community in recent years.","The network\u2019s native token, GovGen, will be distributed to ATOM holders who either voted \u201Cno\u201D or were automatically assigned a no vote due to their delegation status on the Cosmos Hub proposal 848. This particular proposal \u2014 aimed at capping the maximum inflation rate at 10% \u2014 was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264683\/cosmos-community-approves-capping-atom-inflation-rate-at-10?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">approved<\/a> despite Kwon\u2019s objections, contrasting with the stance of numerous other contributors within the ecosystem.","Kwon, who played a pivotal role in developing the Cosmos\u2019s Tendermint consensus algorithm and co-founding the Cosmos Hub, had earlier expressed concerns regarding the 848 proposal\u2019s implications for network security.","\u201CThe objective of GovGen is to provide a forum to facilitate the forking and splitting of blockchains based on governance activity, or in other words 'smart chain reproduction'. GovGen is a forum that incubates a fork, while AtomOne is the fork,\u201D Kwon told The Block in a statement.","The Cosmos Hub, released in 2019, has seen the founders Kwon and Ethan Buchman take separate paths over time. Both remain active within the Cosmos ecosystem, albeit through different entities. Kwon leads AiB, while Buchman is at the helm of Informal Systems, which supported proposal 848.","Kwon\u2019s new project with GovGen \u2014 and, subsequently, AtomOne \u2014 represents an effort to rebuild the Hub under a governance model aligning with his and his followers\u2019 visions. The primary objective of GovGen will be to gauge community sentiment regarding various proposals related to AtomOne\u2019s foundational constitution.","Notably, the GovGen token is designed solely for voting purposes within this context and will not be transferable or tradable. Once the GovGen holders decide on AtomOne\u2019s design, it\u2019s expected to go live soon after.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
