What follows is a timeline reconstruction of how we got here.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Last week, the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/04\/25\/ny-attorney-general-sues-bitfinex-and-tether\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sued Bitfinex and Tether<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, the crypto exchange and the firm behind the stablecoin with the same name, respectively. In the suit, the NYAG\u2019s office claimed Bitfinex and Tether had misled investors by failing to disclose that $850 million belonging to Bitfinex is inaccessible and that Bitfinex had received a line of credit from Tether to continue operations. The line of credit inadvertently means that the outstanding Tether tokens are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/04\/30\/bitfinex-reveals-stablecoin-is-only-74-backed-by-cash-says-its-simultaneously-addressing-requests-from-nyag-doj-and-cftc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">no longer backed one-on-one with dollars<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> held in its reserve.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The $850 million is believed frozen in multiple accounts controlled by Crypto Capital, according to what Bitfinex told the NYAG\u2019s office. Specifically, according to the filing by the NYAG\u2019s office, Crypto Capital told Bitfinex and Tether that the dollars have been seized by authorities in Poland, Portugal and the U.S. However, the filing also states that Bitfinex and Tether do not believe Crypto Capital\u2019s representation that the funds have been seized.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Earlier this week <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/04\/30\/no-bitfinexs-seized-850-million-is-not-likely-to-be-unfrozen-within-weeks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in an article<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> diving into this claim and confirming that at least some of the missing $850 million has in fact been seized, I explained why it is unrealistic that dollars would be retrieved from Crypto Capital in the near future and that the IEO could therefore be Bitfinex\u2019s Plan B.<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitfinex.com\/wp-2019-05.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Just now<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, we learned that Plan B is becoming Plan A.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Excerpts of the white paper already revealed that Bitfinex plans to issue and sell 1 billion exchange tokens at 1 USDT each to raise funds to cover for the $850 million hole in Bitfinex\u2019s books. Every month, Bitfinex intends to buy back the tokens, called LEO, at a market rate using at least 27% of its monthly profits, until only 100 million tokens remain. In addition, the excerpts specify that Bitfinex reserves the right to buy back the tokens within 18 months in case its funds with Crypto Capital become accessible.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although under different circumstances, the IEO draws parallels to 2016 when Bitfinex offered BFX tokens to cover for a roughly 70 million dollar loss as a result of a hack. But how did we end up here, again?<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although working with Crypto Capital since 2015, the payment processor became instrumental to Bitfinex in early 2017. Back then, Bitfinex had bank accounts at multiple Taiwanese banks, but ran into trouble when Wells Fargo stopped offering its correspondent banking services to Bitfinex (and Tether) in March of 2017. Bitfinex\u2019s Taiwanese banks blocked and refused wire transfers only a few weeks later. Jan Ludovicus van der Velde, Bitfinex CEO, said the decision by Wells Fargo jeopardized the entire business at the time.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Unable to secure stable banking relationships, Crypto Capital provided a way for Bitfinex to hold its customers and corporate funds. As Stuart Hoegner, Bitfinex\u2019s and Tether\u2019s general counsel, explains in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/408190972\/Stuart-Hoegner-Affidavit-4-30#from_embed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">response<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to the NYAG lawsuit, Bitfinex and Tether opened additional accounts with Crypto Capital during 2017 and 2018, entrusting the payment processor with an increasing amount of funds.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">From early 2017 on, Crypto Capital became the main entity processing fiat deposits and withdrawals to and from Bitfinex, at least for its retail customers. Bitfinex listed bank accounts in control of Crypto Capital as their fiat deposit address, even though the name Crypto Capital was nowhere to be found on its platform. In addition however, Bitfinex also stored part of its corporate and customer funds in Crypto Capital accounts.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Even though Bitfinex and Crypto Capital never engaged in a formal contract according to the NYAG\u2019s office, the arrangement worked well, until the end of 2017. By then and going into 2018, some Bitfinex customers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/archive.fo\/lybpc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">complained<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> (archived link) about waiting for, at times, a month to receive their fiat deposits and withdrawals, or not receiving them at all. In February, Bitfinex posted a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bitfinex\/comments\/7ywbwp\/fiat_transaction_delays_transparency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fiat transaction delays notification<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, specifically mentioning transactions executed between Jan. 10 and Feb. 5.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the time, Bitfinex listed a deposit account belonging to a Polish company named Crypto SP. Z O.O., with SP. Z O.O. being the Polish equivalent of LLC. A document signed by Crypto Capital\u2019s compliance officer obtained by The Block states that \u201CiFinex Inc. is a valued corporate client of our financial institution.\u201D The document further lists funding instructions including a bank account number at the Cooperative Bank of Skiernicewiece in the name of Crypto SP. Z O.O. According to the document, Crypto SP. Z O.O. is a \u201Cwholly owned subsidiary of Crypto Capital.\u201D Documents from the Polish business registry confirm that the Polish company is owned by Crypto Capital and also lists Crypto Capital\u2019s president, Ivan Manuel Molina Lee.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Based on information obtained by The Block and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/04\/30\/no-bitfinexs-seized-850-million-is-not-likely-to-be-unfrozen-within-weeks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> on earlier this week, Polish authorities seized bank accounts in name of Crypto SP. Z O.O. as part of an anti-money laundering operation. Authorities seized equivalent to $350 million from Crypto SP. Z O.O. and another company called NESO SP. Z O.O., which is registered at the same address and also lists Molina as its president.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It appears that at least the first move in this investigation was executed at the end of January 2018, coinciding with Bitfinex\u2019s customers complaining about not receiving their fiat deposits and withdrawals. Furthermore, also in January, the Cooperative Bank in Skierniewice had to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/obligacje.pl\/pl\/a\/bank-spoldzielczy-w-skierniewicach-przyjal-depozyty-na-1-mld-zl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> (in Polish) an increase in deposits equivalent to around $275 million, more than doubling the amount of money deposited in the bank compared to June 2017. By February however, the amount of deposits <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/obligacje.pl\/pl\/a\/bs-skierniewice-zanotowal-odplyw-depozytow-poprawil-wspolczynnik-wyplacalnosci\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reportedly<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> (in Polish) declined by around the same amount, negating the initial increase.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Polish follow-up investigation led to a third company, ITRAN SP. Z O.O., from which authorities seized additional assets. On its own platform at the time, Crypto Capital referred its customers to an account in name of the third company. The salient detail is that the original name of the company was not ITRAN, but Global Transaction Services, also a payment processor. Daniel Barrs, then head of Global Transaction Services, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-ndga\/pr\/business-owner-indicted-failing-establish-effective-anti-money-laundering-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">was indicted<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> for failing to follow anti-money laundering requirements in 2016.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The exact relationship between ITRAN and Crypto Capital is unknown, although the Polish investigation appears to focus on the Crypto and NESO companies and related individuals. According to a source familiar with the matter and information reviewed by The Block, the investigation appears to be ongoing.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pressed on the investigation back in 2018, Bitfinex\u2019s head of marketing Kasper Rasmussen said in an emailed statement that \u201Cdespite some of the speculation that occurred at the time of the initial reporting, Bitfinex\u2019s platform\/operations and user funds have not been impacted or affected by this investigation. Deposit addresses on Bitfinex changed frequently before this story broke and have continued to do so after. Our users have not lost funds or have had funds seized as a result of this investigation. Additionally, to date neither Bitfinex nor any of its users\/related parties have been called as a witness or a party to this investigation.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although proven untrue now, at least in regard to Bitfinex\u2019s operations being unaffected, it could not be verified last year. The statement may have also been consistent with Bitfinex\u2019s knowledge about the investigation at the time. In his affidavit, Hoegner writes that \u201Cat least one governmental entity has confirmed that it was involved in the seizure of Crypto Capital funds,\u201D which seems to at least refer to the Polish authorities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Molina declined to comment, citing ongoing legal proceedings, as did a spokesperson for the Polish Ministry of Justice. A spokesperson for the Cooperative Bank of Skiernicewiece in Poland offered no comment, citing bank secrecy. A spokesperson for Europol confirmed Europol\u2019s involvement in the operation, but declined to speak in detail and referred back to the Polish authorities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the Polish bank accounts no longer usable, Bitfinex changed its deposit address to a Dutch account at ING at the end of January. That account, in name of a company called Haparc B.V., was not linked to Crypto Capital, with ING <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-02-20\/digital-exchange-bitfinex-under-u-s-scrutiny-gets-ing-account\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">confirming<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to be aware that Bitfinex was behind the account. Nevertheless, the account was only used for about ten days before being closed down according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for ING declined to comment.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitfinex subsequently moved back to list a bank account linked to Crypto Capital at the Portuguese bank Caixa Geral de Depositos in name of Swiss-based Global Trade Solutions AG. Crypto Capital seems to have been able to operate that account until around May. It is unclear whether the account was closed down by the bank or seized by authorities. Portugal is named as one of the three countries where portions of Bitfinex\u2019s $850 million are supposedly held.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Around the same time, Reginald Fowler, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-sdny\/pr\/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">indicted<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> this week by the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for bank fraud and running an unlicensed money transmitting service among others, entered the scene.

In addition, wire details obtained by The Block, the earliest dated in February, show that Crypto Capital used Portuguese companies MOGW ENERGY TRADE LDA and Eligibility Criterion Unipessoal LDA, both (co-)owned by Fowler, to process fiat withdrawals for Bitfinex. The companies too had accounts at Caixa Geral de Depositos. A spokesperson for Caixa Geral de Depositos declined to comment, citing bank secrecy obligations.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Global Trading Solutions LLC became the supplier of bank accounts for Bitfinex\u2019s fiat transactions through multiple U.S. financial institutions, namely Citibank, Enterprise Bank &amp; Trust and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2018\/10\/06\/bitfinex-moves-its-banking-relationship-to-hsbc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HSBC<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The fiat transactions had their hiccups now and then, according to correspondence between Crypto Capital and Bitfinex customers, with some customers who spoke to The Block only receiving a refund on the Bitfinex platform after half a year.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By mid-2018, Bitfinex became more and more aware of Crypto Capital\u2019s problems, as laid out in chat logs between Bitfinex and Crypto Capital executives in the NYAG\u2019s filing last week. In a message on Aug. 15, Merlin asks Oz, Bitfinex and Crypto Capital executives, if he can make $100 million available to Bitfinex to process customer withdrawals. Referring to what appears to be the Polish investigation, Merlin follows up by saying \u201CI understand some of the funds are being held by [redacted], but what about the rest?\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It remains unknown what happened to the U.S. accounts, but it appears that the accounts at Citibank and Enterprise Bank &amp; Trust were closed down.

Enterprise Bank &amp; Trust did not reply to a request for comment.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In an extraordinary shareholder meeting held on the Jun. 13, 2018, Crypto Capital Corp., the Panama-based company behind Crypto Capital, decided to dissolve and liquidate itself, according to a public registry filing.

Its <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gts.solutions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">website<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> however, lists a logo that includes 2001, providing the impression that Global Trade Solutions AG is actually a much older company than it seems.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It is unclear how the dissolution of Crypto Capital Corp affects any investigations and the retrieval of Bitfinex\u2019s inaccessible dollars. It appears as though, from mid-2018 onwards, all bank accounts used by Crypto Capital were linked to Global Trading Solutions LLC, Fowler\u2019s company, rather than any accounts in its own name or that of its subsidiaries. Crypto Capital continued to process Bitfinex\u2019s fiat transactions, according to correspondence reviewed by The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By October 2018, when Bitfinex listed the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2018\/10\/06\/bitfinex-moves-its-banking-relationship-to-hsbc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HSBC<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> account as its deposit address, the delays on fiat withdrawals intensified.

However, as the chat logs printed in the NYAG\u2019s filing reveal, a Bitfinex representative writes that it is running low on cash reserves apart from those that are with Crypto Capital on the same day.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The indictment against Fowler and Yosef further reveals that all funds from the HSBC account were seized by U.S. authorities on Oct. 23. It is unknown how much, if any, of the funds seized from the bank account are part of Bitfinex\u2019s inaccessible $850 million.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Having learned of the New York State investigation, Bitfinex contacted the NYAG\u2019s office in early November. On Nov. 27, the same day Tether <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/tether.to\/tether-reopens-account-verification-and-direct-redemption-of-fiat-from-its-platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> reopening direct redemptions, the NYAG\u2019s office issued subpoenas to both Bitfinex and Tether seeking documents and information that includes the identification of \u201Cany bank, depository institution, money transmitter, trust, account, or other similar entity currently used by Tether and Bitfinex for Virtual Currency or fiat currency. Identify and describe the decision(s) by Tether and\/or Bitfinex to change banks (or other similar entities as noted above) between January 1, 2016 and the present date.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Around the same time, Bitfinex grew more and more worried about the funds stuck with Crypto Capital. A day after the NYAG issued its subpoena, Merlin writes to Oz that \u201Cwe are at the end of the month and you haven\u2019t been sending out one wire. [Not] even 1 usd for the whole month\u201D and \u201CI think you should stop playing and tell me the truth about what is going on.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To keep Bitfinex\u2019s operation going, we have now learned that Tether transferred $625 million from its cash reserves to Bitfinex. In return, Bitfinex transferred the same amount to Tether internally at Crypto Capital. The move can basically be seen as a book entry that has no apparent changes other than guaranteeing Bitfinex access to funds. However, the move directly exposed Tether to the funds frozen with Crypto Capital. Neither Bitfinex nor Tether publicly declared the transactions and we may have never learned of either if the Crypto Capital situation had resolved itself.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By December last year, Crypto Capital no longer listed Bitfinex as a partnered exchange. At this point, as written in a letter to the NYAG\u2019s office, Bitfinex and Tether questioned Crypto Capital\u2019s side of the story: \u201CWhile Crypto Capital\u2019s principals have represented that the unavailable funds have been seized or otherwise restrained by governmental authorities in Poland, Portugal, and the United States. the Companies grew concerned that Crypto Capital\u2019s principals may be engaged in a fraud . . .\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meeting with the NYAG\u2019s office on Feb. 21, counsel for Bitfinex and Tether explained their plan for Bitfinex to receive a line of credit to draw from the dollars backing Tether.

It therefore appears that at least some of the missing millions are either embezzled or otherwise out of reach.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whether the $850 million is missing, \u2018seized and safeguarded\u2019, or a combination of both, the IEO is now confirmed to be Bitfinex\u2019s solution to fill the gap left by the Crypto Capital mess. If successful in raising 1 billion dollars, the IEO would eliminate the necessity for a line of credit from Tether, which is central to the NYAG\u2019s office lawsuit. One of the NYAG\u2019s main points of contention is the \u201Cquestionable collateral\u201D in the form of shares in DigFinex, the parent company of iFinex. iFinex in turn owns both Bitfinex and Tether, which means that the loan from Tether is collateralized in, at least partly, shares of itself. Presumably, eliminating the line of credit from Tether may be the main objective of the IEO in light of the New York State lawsuit. It may be the reason the plan has been put in motion now. Whether it will solve their problems, and gain the NYAG\u2019s blessing, remains to be seen.<\/span>"],"hashtag":[]}
