Buterin came out more strongly in favor of \u2018enshrining\u2019 some protocols to Ethereum\u2019s code, like ERC-4337, than others, like private mempools, but concludes that each presents \u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a complicated tradeoff\u201D that will \u201Ccontinue to evolve over time.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Buterin also expressed concerns toward the concentration of Ethereum\u2019s liquid staking providers. The liquid staking pool Lido currently controls over 32% of staked ether, although this is spread across a variety of different validators. Buterin said that Lido and Rocket Pool, two of the top providers, each have different risks and noted that they have some safety mechanisms in place \u2014 although these may not be enough.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rather than relying on \u201Cmoralistic pressure\u201D to encourage using a more diverse set of staking providers, Buterin in his post contemplates changes to Ethereum\u2019s protocol that would further decentralize liquid staking. This could include tweaking liquid staking provider RocketPool\u2019s approach or giving a randomly sampled committee of small stakers extra governance powers.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
