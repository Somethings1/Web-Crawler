This is an improvement on established privacy networks. Tor in particular relies primarily on donations, government funding, non-profit grants, and contracts. There is no economic incentive for operators which means volunteers have to cover the cost of running and maintaining the privacy system. In contrast, the Nym incentive scheme rewards mixnodes and validators that provide good quality of service, while encouraging the network to scale in response to demand.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The next step for Nym\u2019s \u201CFinney\u201D testnet will be to implement the reward-sharing and proof of mixing algorithm into their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nymtech.net\/nym-whitepaper.pdf)\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">whitepaper<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. In later releases Nym will make the validators completely permissionless. But first they need to make sure Nym\u2019s giant mixnet contains only nodes providing the highest-quality of service and uptime. This will likely cause the testnet to shrink to a smaller number of high capacity nodes that can ensure a high quality of service. Participants will then be allowed to use delegated staking in order to vote for the best performing nodes.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Delegated staking allows people who hold testnet token HAL, but who might not have the technical capacity to run a good mixnode, to participate by staking HALs on other mixnodes of their preference. The delegated stake represents reputation in the network and contributes to determining&nbsp; whether the node will be selected to perform the work of mixing packets and providing privacy.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nym is further improving privacy systems by decentralising the usage of semi-centralised directory authorities.&nbsp; In the case of Tor, the entire network can be taken offline if these <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.torproject.org\/comment\/83781\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">directory authorities are seized or even fall victim to a DDoS attack<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.
