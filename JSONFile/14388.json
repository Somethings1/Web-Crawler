Binance\u2019s decision to prioritize commercial success over compliance with U.S. law has been, as Lim paraphrased Zhao\u2019s position on the matter, a 'biz decision.'\"","Employees for the firm also told U.S. customers how to access the site through virtual private networks, despite the ostensible block on U.S. access due to the lack of registration, the CFTC alleges.&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This was despite Binance, Zhao and other executives knowing that soliciting customers in the U.S. without register to business in the country, as required under U.S. law, the CFTC said.&nbsp;<\/span>","In addition to offering illicit trades in the U.S., the allegedly lax approach to compliance may have led to more serious implications, like possible transactions by U.S. and EU-designated terrorist organizations on the platform, according to internal communications reviewed by the CFTC.&nbsp;","\"Internally, Binance officers, employees, and agents have acknowledged that the Binance platform has facilitated potentially illegal activities,\" the complaint reads. \"For example, in February 2019, after receiving information 'regarding HAMAS transactions' on Binance, Lim explained to a colleague that terrorists usually send 'small sums' as \u201Clarge sums constitute money laundering.' Lim\u2019s colleague replied: 'can barely buy an AK47 with 600 bucks.' And with regard to certain Binance customers, including customers from Russia, Lim acknowledged in a February 2020 chat: 'Like come on. They are here for crime.' Binance\u2019s money laundering reporting officer agreed that 'we see the bad, but we close 2 eyes.'\"","In response to the news Zhao tweeted simply \"<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cz_binance\/status\/1640372505046052866?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">4<\/a>\", his <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cz_binance\/status\/1610018096122851328?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">code<\/a> for reporting or \"attacks\" he does not agree with.&nbsp;","\"The complaint filed by the CFTC is unexpected and disappointing as we have been working collaboratively with the CFTC for more than two years,\" a Binance spokesperson said in a statement provided to The Block. \"We have made significant investments over the past two years to ensure we do not have US users active on our platform, including increasing compliance personnel from \"approximately 100\" to \"around 750 core and supporting compliance personnel today,\" the spokesperson said.&nbsp;","The Securities and Exchange Commission, which sometimes makes concurrent enforcement filings with the CFTC, declined to comment as to whether their own enforcement action could be pending. An SEC lawyer recently told a federal judge in ongoing proceedings over the company's possible acquisition of crypto investment firm Voyager that that it is SEC staff opinion that Binance has operated an unregistered securities exchange in the U.S.&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The price of bitcoin immediately declined on the news, trading down 4% to $26,8871 at 10:39 a.m. EDT, but soon partially recovered to over $27,000 per coin.&nbsp;<\/span>","The complaint lists Binance's regional affiliates, including the operating company for Binance.US, BAM Trading, as \"other relevant entities\" and notes that BAM \"has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity\" to trade commodities in the U.S. The complaint also casts doubt on the separation of Binance and Binance.US, citing Zhao's control of both and that \"Binance personnel, including Zhao, have dictated Binance.US\u2019s corporate strategy, launch, and early operations. At Zhao\u2019s direction, Binance.US\u2019s marketing and branding has mirrored that of Binance.com.\"&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The complaint comes a month and a half after crypto service provider Paxos <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210919\/sec-to-sue-paxos-for-listing-binance-usd-stablecoin-wsj\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">received notice<\/a> of an investigation into its joint stablecoin offering with Binance and voluntarily ended its minting of the dollar-pegged token.<\/span>","The CFTC alleges that Binance tried to hide how ineffective its compliance program was from its business partners, including Paxos. The company went through a compliance audit to \u201Csatisfy a request from Paxos,\u201D the agency said. \u201CBut according to Lim, Binance purposely engaged a compliance auditor that would \u2018just do a half assed individual sub audit on geo[fencing]\u201D to \u2018buy us more time,\u2019\" the complaint reads.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">UPDATE<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With additional details from the complaint and comment or requests for comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em>","© 2023 The Block.
