Yep, another criminal case of someone allegedly using crypto to conduct their criminal enterprise. Will criminals learn? Sure, I don\u2019t know. Probably, not? I mean, these networks are all public ledgers. As in, the transactions are open. I mean... Okay, enough ranting. What\u2019s going on here?","According to the criminal complaint Binh Thanh Le, Steven McCall, and Allante Pires were charged with conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with intent to distribute controlled substances such as MDMA, Ketamine, and Xanax. In particular, the government alleges \u201Cthat the defendants, primarily operating out of an office space in Stoughton, MA, sold drugs via the Dark Web in exchange for Bitcoin, and shipped the drugs to customers using the United States Postal Service.\u201D","Do people know that the US Postal Service has a law enforcement arm? It\u2019s called the United States Postal Inspection Service, and I assure you that the Inspection Service is no joke. They have a particular focus on illegal narcotics and the dark web. To quote their website \u201C[a]s part of this effort, the Inspection Service has developed tools to identify those who attempt to hide behind the secrecy of the dark web and cryptocurrency to misuse the postal network.\u201D I mean, \u201C<em class=\"mf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">these networks are all public ledgers. As in, the transactions are open. I mean\u2026<\/em>\u201D Okay, I\u2019m really done ranting now.","All three of the defendants were detained pre-trial. Each defendant filed motions to revoke their pre-trial detention. McCall and Pires\u2019s pre-trial motions were granted. This order relates to Le\u2019s motion to revoke his detention, that was ultimately denied. Why was Le\u2019s motion denied and not his alleged co-conspirators?","According to the Court the \u201Cstrength of the evidence against Le and his apparent role as the leader of this sophisticated conspiracy distinguish him from McCall and Pires.\u201D Le is allegedly the ringleader, and the Court felt that Le was both a public safety risk, and a flight risk.","As to Le\u2019s ringleader status, allegedly, everything is in Le\u2019s name, he told an undercover cop that he had \u201Cpeople working for him,\u201D he delegated tasks via text message, and the authorities found ammunition and drug residue outside the business address. That was sufficient to find Le a public safety risk.","Furthermore, the Court determined that Le was a flight risk, because Le \u201Cwas arrested while attempting to exchange $200,000 worth of Bitcoin for U.S. currency and may have access to additional drug proceeds if released,\u201D and allegedly there were drug shipments from Switzerland and Canada.","I guess the lesson here is that if you\u2019re arrested on allegations of running a drug ring and you\u2019ve got hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin that you\u2019re attempting to exchange for dirty fiat, and you have international contacts, the authorities are probably not going to let you out on bail.","<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Crypto Caselaw Minute is provided for educational purposes only by Stephen Palley (@stephendpalley) and Nelson Rosario (@nelsonmrosario). &nbsp;These summaries are not legal advice.
