The bitcoin-only Trezor Safe 3 was built to commemorate the Trezor's 10th anniversary and comes in \u201CBitcoin Orange,\u201D and the Trezor Keep Metal is designed to provide a mistake-proof, convenient backup solution for users recovery seed, the team added.","\u201CBitcoin, and the wider cryptocurrency sector, has been with us now for 14 years. It is no longer a niche interest,\u201D Trezor CEO Matěj Žák said in the statement. \u201CThere are 420 million crypto owners worldwide and, according to predictions, this number will more than double by 2027 to almost a billion \u2014 one in eight of the global population.\u201D","\u201CEvents over the last year or so [like FTX\u2019s collapse] have demonstrated the risks people are taking when they entrust the custody of their cryptocurrencies to centralized exchanges. Time and again, we\u2019ve seen the reality of \u2018not your keys, not your coins\u2019 play out,\u201D Žák continued. \u201CAs we approach the next wave of Bitcoin adoption, we\u2019ve introduced new devices that enable crypto novices and newcomers to enjoy the security and peace of mind that comes with owning and safeguarding their own crypto.\u201D","The Trezor Safe 3 integrates with the existing Trezor Suite desktop application, allowing users to buy, sell and exchange their assets securely. The wallet supports bitcoin, ether and more than 7,000 other coins and tokens.","The Trezor Safe 3 also adds another layer of security by introducing a secure element, offering tamper-resistant protection against physical attacks.","Unlike rival manufacturer Ledger, Trezor devices are open-source, meaning they are community-based and audited, so vulnerabilities may be seen and fixed faster. On the other hand, it may make devices easier to crack when they are stolen. For the Trezor Safe 3 secure element, a third-party vendor was chosen that allows it to publish any vulnerabilities discovered.","In a nod to Trezor\u2019s launch year, only 2,013 bitcoin-only versions will be produced, with \u20AC21 ($22) from each sale donated to support the Trezor Academy, a Bitcoin education initiative.","The Trezor Keep Metal, crafted from aerospace-grade stainless steel, is resistant to fire, water and corrosion, the team claims, helping to ensure the safety of recovery seeds. Available for both 12-word and 24-word backups at $99, it's also compatible with the more advanced 2-of-3 Shamir split recovery seed backup scheme for the Trezor Safe 3, priced at $249.","A recovery seed, often referred to as a seed phrase or backup phrase, is a series of words generated when setting up crypto wallets, serving as a backup method to restore access to funds in case access to the wallet is lost.","\u201CWe understand that self-custody can be intimidating, especially for newcomers,\u201D Žák added. \u201CThat\u2019s why we have designed the new wallets and the backup solution with beginners in mind. They\u2019re packed with security features to keep digital assets safe.\u201D","The new products are available for pre-order now, with shipping commencing in mid-November.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","© 2023 The Block.
