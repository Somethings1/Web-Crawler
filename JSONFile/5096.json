I won't discount that we might get active again on the M&amp;A side, but if we don't get these right, we don't get the right to buy more companies,\" he said.&nbsp;","Last year, Galaxy Digital <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163540\/galaxy-digital-terminates-its-acquisition-of-bitgo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">terminated<\/a> an agreement to buy crypto custodian BitGo, a deal it had announced in 2021 for $1.2 billion.","Shares in the Mike Novogratz-led company have plummeted alongside cryptocurrency prices, dipping down to around $3.34 from about $19 a year ago.

So far this year, bitcoin is number one and ethereum is number three, he said.","\"We think it's impossible for investors who care about looking at all the tools they could have in their toolkit to look at those assets and not be interested,\" Ferraro said.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: This story has been updated to reflect Ferraro's role as president, and adds the termination of the BitGo deal.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
