Lawyers for the FTX debtors argued against appointing an examiner during a court hearing on Monday, saying it would be too expensive and could raise cybersecurity concerns.&nbsp;","Lawyers for the U.S. Trustee, the FTX debtors, the creditors committee and the liquidators are expected to update the judge on their progress at the next FTX hearing on Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.","\u201CIt\u2019s simply going to be a duplication of effort and an enormous amount of expense,\u201D said James Bromley, a lawyer for FTX and other affiliated debtors, like Alameda Research. \u201CWe do not have enough money to pay back all of our creditors.\u201D","Judge John Dorsey acknowledged on Monday that appointing an examiner could cost the bankruptcy estate hundreds of millions of dollars and discussed the possibility of giving the examiner a set budget to head off that concern.&nbsp;","The fact that FTX has $1.2 billion in unrestricted cash \u201Cis not the point,\u201D Bromley continued, because the debtors \u201Cneed $8 billion of unrestricted cash.\u201D","Arguments and cross-examinations lasted approximately five hours. After the lawyers finished closing arguments, Dorsey invited them to talk privately in his conference room to find a \"consensual resolution\" that would pre-empt a ruling by the judge. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","A similar examiner was appointed in the bankruptcy proceedings of crypto lender Celsius, and filed a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207079\/highlights-from-the-court-report-detailing-celsius-ponzi-like-downfall\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bombshell report<\/span><\/a>&nbsp;last week.&nbsp;Lawyers for the Official&nbsp;Committee&nbsp;of Unsecured&nbsp;Creditors of FTX and joint provisional liquidators in the Bahamas also argued against the examiner motion.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","FTX CEO John Ray III testified as a witness during the Monday hearing and offered a glimpse into the trove of documents and data his team has sifted through since the firm filed for bankruptcy protection in November.
