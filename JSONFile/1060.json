Yet some in the industry worry the Data Act may have far-reaching effects on crypto if the scope isn\u2019t clearly defined, especially as smart contracts \u2014 automated executions written into software \u2014 underpin the infrastructure of DeFi.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The greatest potential of the legislation, according to Pilar del Castillo Vera, a centrist-right MEP and rapporteur on the Data Act, is to \u201Ccontribute to optimizing existing business models and processes, boost the development of new ones, and by doing so creating new values and jobs,\u201D she said, opening Tuesday\u2019s plenary in the European Parliament in Strasbourg.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Smart contracts fall under Article 30 of the Data Act, on \u201Cessential requirements regarding smart contracts for data sharing.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Provisions include \u201Crigorous access control mechanisms\u201D and protection of trade secrets integrated into the design of smart contracts. There would need to be a possibility to terminate or interrupt transaction mechanisms, and lawmakers will need to decide which conditions would make that permissible.<\/span>","The Parliament removed some of the onerous language from the European Commission\u2019s proposal. For example, smart contract developers would have needed to follow cumbersome compliance processes like issuing an EU declaration of conformity, according to documents previously <a class=\"c-link c-link--focus-visible\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207994\/eu-smart-contract-regulation-deescalates-parliament-draft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207994\/eu-smart-contract-regulation-deescalates-parliament-draft\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">seen<\/a> by The Block.","\u201CThese changes may limit more or less the possibility to develop harmonized standards for smart contracts,\u201D European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton said in a press conference after the vote. He also noted that providing interoperability, harmonization standards and legal certainty were the Commission\u2019s main motivations for the smart contract provisions.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe legislation will now travel into trilogue negotiations, where each EU institution will defend its position. This will provide an opportunity for policymakers to negotiate issues on smart contracts, del Castillo added in the press conference.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For Natalie Linhart, legal counsel at blockchain software firm ConsenSys, the smart contract provisions don\u2019t seem to be too overbearing for the industry. \u201CWe see Article 30 as a marginal provision applicable to smart contracts facilitating data transfers involving IoT products \u2014 not those deployed in DeFi applications.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the coast is not yet clear. Linhart hopes to ensure \u201Cstandards aren't extended to other smart contracts in future legislative proposals touching crypto,\u201D she told The Block in an email. \u201CSetting substantive requirements for blockchain development would restrict innovation and make the EU an unwelcome place for software developers.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For the European Crypto Initiative advocacy group, the Data Act has been a focus of their attention over the past months.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt would be really hard, almost impossible, for most smart contracts that we have today to be compliant with this article,\u201D Marina Markezic, head of EUCI, told The Block on a call.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The rules proposed don\u2019t align to the smart contracts that we know today, Markezic said, and may spur the development of a different technology to fit the mold. \u201CIt\u2019s saying you will need to use a fruit that is called \u2018strawberry\u2019 and it needs to be blue. And basically you need to come up with a strawberry that is blue because all the ones we have are red.\u201D<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Correction: updates to correct details of EU conformity requirements.&nbsp;<\/em>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: story updated to add comments from Thierry Breton.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
