The CFTC currently can \u2014 and has \u2014 taken <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/178781\/cftc-highlights-legal-actions-against-crypto-firms-in-year-end-wrap-up\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">enforcement actions<\/a> against alleged fraud and market manipulation in crypto markets, but its rulemaking authority is limited to derivatives and futures contracts.&nbsp;","The CFTC chair noted that the structure of crypto intermediaries is \"fraught with potential disaster,\" because crypto exchanges fuse a number of duties that would typically be split.&nbsp;","\u201CA native exchange in the crypto space is probably an exchange, a dealer, a custodian and a bank, all in one. Right? I mean, just think about that in traditional finance, there\u2019s too many conflicts layered on, we wouldn\u2019t have that. So those are the types of things we need to remediate,\u201D Behnam said. \"This just raises a lot of interesting policy questions about market structure. And that's why I think we have to be very proactive in coming up with a policy framework that is not too different from what we have now in our traditional market spaces.\"&nbsp;","A bill before the Senate Agriculture Committee that would grant Behnam and his agency the direct authority over crypto spot markets that he's called for has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/178485\/sbf-posts-regulatory-manual-for-crypto-and-ftx-cautions-against-locking-in-defi-policy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">vocal support<\/a> from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and his company, but has received skepticism if not opposition from some developers and lobbyists for the digital asset industry.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
