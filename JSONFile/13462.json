It currently ranks behind leading protocols such as Lido with 9 million ETH, Rocket Pool with 846,000 ETH, and Frax with 236,000 ETH, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/sandra\/eth2-staking\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dune data<\/a> aggregated by Dragonfly analyst Hildobby.","The surge in Swell inflows coincides with its team announcing \"Pearl\" rewards in the form of points for users who mint its liquid staking token, swETH, and also \"restake\" it on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/246998\/eigenlayers-tvl-nears-240-million-as-it-gears-up-for-eigenworlds-nft-mint\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EigenLayer<\/a> platform.","Since mid-December, when the reward program began, there has been notable activity, with users minting over 53,000 swETH worth more than $120 million. Most of this was subsequently deposited on EigenLayer.","EigenLayer allows users to deposit and re-stake ether from a variety of liquid staking tokens to secure third-party networks.

Among these new additions, Swell has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries in terms of asset inflows.","&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Swell's total value locked | Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/swell-network\/swell-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Swell<\/a> (via Dune)<\/span>","Despite documented <a href=\"https:\/\/eprint.iacr.org\/2023\/605.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">risks<\/a> with liquid staking, Swell's TVL surge shows that it continues to be a growing niche within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its popularity is largely attributed to simplifying the complexity associated with staking, particularly in terms of running validator nodes and allowing users to maintain control over their capital.","Swell users who stake their ETH receive a yield-bearing liquid staking token in return. The token not only holds value but also provides flexibility, as it can be retained or utilized within the broader DeFi ecosystem to generate additional yields.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
