Liquidity providers of trading pools that produce the most volume will receive the majority of swap fees, in addition to boosted rewards based on a new time-lock implementation they could opt into. A variable percentage of trading fees would also be used to buy-back and burn sushi from the open market and to lock liquidity for added price support.","A final change would switch the emissions to 1-3% APY for the sushi token in an effort to reduce inflation and balance the overall emissions with the buy-backs, burns, and <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.sushi.com\/t\/sushi-tokenomics-redesign\/11621?u=jaredgrey\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">locked liquidity<\/a> used for price support from trading fees.","\u201CWe aim to incentivize long-term participation in the Sushi ecosystem while reducing the number of extractive participants,\u201D the proposal said.","Its current model promotes non-sticky liquidity, where users can stake sushi, receive rewards and get an optimal ROI, even though they\u2019re not LPs. From historical data, Sushi found that its current xSushi model allows xSushi stakers to receive a disproportionate rate of rewards compared to liquidity providers.","Some of the main concerns Grey said are <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jaredgrey\/status\/1608886166111285255?s=20&amp;t=pYu6gBFWMUV8SvzDbgKt7w\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201Cgood points\u201D in a discussion on Twitter<\/a> are that the emissions are greater than the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/curvethots\/status\/1608884902363287553?s=20&amp;t=pYu6gBFWMUV8SvzDbgKt7w\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fee revenue and burns<\/a>. Another concern is that large positioned LPs could max timelock and receive majority of the rewards.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
