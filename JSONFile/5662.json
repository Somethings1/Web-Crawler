Until now, Teneo representatives contend that Zhu, Davies and other investment managers have provided only \"selective and piecemeal disclosures\" through their lawyers.","\"The Founders, through counsel, implausibly insist that the meager information provided to the Foreign Representatives [Teneo], which amounts to an incomplete list of assets and selective disclosures regarding the means to access certain digital assets electronically, represents all of the documents in their possession relating to the Debtor,\" said the filing.","The subpoenas would compel 3AC to produce documents \"to identify the existence of, location of, and method of accessing and controlling the assets\" of the fund, including account information, seed phrases and keys, among other information.","Teneo representatives previously requested that the Singapore law firm representing the founders accept service of papers. The firm, Advocatus Law, resisted.&nbsp;","\"The Founders\u2019 recent use of their Twitter accounts and the Founders\u2019 use of those accounts for purposes related to the Debtor makes those Twitter accounts a reasonable means to provide the Founders notice of discovery in this action,\" the motion filed Friday reads.&nbsp;","Teneo representatives also say in the filing that they plan to seek an order in the British Virgin Islands to serve Zhu and Davies and require them to attend an examination.&nbsp;","Meanwhile, U.S. regulators are said to be taking a closer look at 3AC, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-10-17\/us-investigating-bankrupt-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a new report from Bloomberg<\/a>. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are investigating whether 3AC misled investors on the financial health of its balance sheet and failed to register with proper authorities, according to people familiar with the matter.&nbsp;","The scrutiny comes amid a high-profile liquidation of the hedge fund, which previously boasted billions under management before incurring significant losses due to its heavy positions in the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD, which crashed earlier this year. Since then, it's entered into<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/155578\/three-arrows-capital-files-for-chapter-15-bankruptcy-in-new-york\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings<\/a> in the Southern District of New York, a status that enables the protection of its U.S.-based assets as it winds through foreign bankruptcy proceedings in the British Virgin Islands.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
