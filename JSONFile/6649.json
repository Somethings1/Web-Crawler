Skybridge first began investing in BTC at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/89533\/anthony-scaramuccis-skybridge-has-invested-182-million-into-bitcoin-according-to-deck\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">end of last year<\/a>.&nbsp;","\"We have a full commitment to crypto,\" he remarked.","Since then, Skybridge has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/98910\/first-advisors-skybridge-bitcoin-etf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">thrown its hat in the bitcoin exchange-traded product ring<\/a> and also plans to launch an ETF that has exposure to publicly traded cryptocurrency companies.","Indeed, Skybridge is one of a number of U.S. companies vying to go to market with a bitcoin ETF. But the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to give the nod to such a product, and the proposed ETF that's furthest along in the process \u2014 put forward by asset management company VanEck \u2014 is now the subject of an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/108643\/sec-more-comment-bitcoin-etf-vaneck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">additional<\/a> comment period. Other companies, like NYDIG, Fidelity and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest, are among those pursuing bitcoin ETF launches.","Skybridge also has plans to launch a private Ethereum fund.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"July 1st, we're launching a private Ethereum fund. We\u2019ll then file for an ETF for Ethereum. Again, it is anybody's guess when those things will be going,\" he said. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Scaramucci went on to say:<\/span>","\"<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I can say \u2014 which is public information \u2014 that we did file for an ETF related to Bitcoin. We also have a UIT with a company out of Wheaton, Illinois, called First Trust\u2026 as we're speaking, we're making an announcement on an ETF for a digital innovation fund that has some great publicly traded assets that we think are geared related to [Ethereum], related to Bitcoin, but also the other coins.\"<\/span>","Scaramucci believes he can lean on his Wall Street chops for product adoption. He cited Morgan Stanley\u2019s buy-in to SkyBridge\u2019s digital asset portfolio as another example of Wall Street\u2019s appetite for Bitcoin. \u201CMorgan Stanley is a very big part of our business.\"","Remaining firm on his bullish stance on Bitcoin\u2019s valuation, Scaramucci told The Scoop:","\u201CHere's what I think. I think that we'll be sitting here a year from now, there'll still be skeptics, still be people that are fence-sitters, but there will be slightly more people in the pool with us and, as a result of which, the prices will be higher. And I just think this is one of those weird assets where the higher the prices go, the more people are going to be drawn into the pool.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
