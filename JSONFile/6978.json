They were the first people who dove into how to set up these large mining facilities. They have been holding the Bitcoin network up and running it forever. So I genuinely feel for the groups that have been working on that... On the other side, I think it's really bullish for North American mining. And I also think it's a testament to how the Bitcoin network is so resilient. An entire country just banned Bitcoin mining that is supposedly accounting for the largest hash distribution in the world. And yet the Bitcoin network continues on.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rising concerns about curbing the energy consumption in bitcoin mining in China have also lead to ESG initiatives in the hopes of producing sustainable mining solutions. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the promise of a sustainable coin seems like one too good to be true. Fabiano dispels some of the misconceptions around bitcoin mining and what it really looks like for a coin to be mined with renewable energy.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSo when we think about the amounts of electricity, for example, that's lost in energy end transmission and distribution it's 19 times that of the Bitcoin network. And the energy footprint of always-on electrical devices in America is 12.1 times that of the Bitcoin network,\" Fabiano said, adding:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"But what we always hear is how Bitcoin is ruining the world. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">We don't care about how your toaster being left on is ruining the world because people don't care that much about it.
