All other Bitstamp services will remain unaffected.\"","The move comes amid a challenging regulatory environment in the U.S. Staking services have recently been targeted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, with the agency saying such services fall under investment contracts and therefore have to be registered as securities.","Earlier this year, crypto exchange Kraken ceased its staking service for U.S. customers as part of its $30 million settlement with the SEC due to an alleged unregistered securities offering. The SEC recently also sued Coinbase, saying the crypto exchange's prime brokerage, exchange and staking programs violate securities laws.

Typically, this process takes a few days but could be extended depending on network conditions.\"","Earlier this month, Bitstamp also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243892\/bitstamp-halts-polygon-solana-other-tokens-us\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">halted<\/a> trading of seven tokens in the U.S. that were all recently called unregistered securities by the SEC including Polygon, Solana and Near Protocol.","Â© 2023 The Block.
