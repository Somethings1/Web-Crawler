Users select a token, buy it on the bonding curve, and sell it whenever they like.","A bonding curve is a mathematical curve that determines the price of a token based on its supply. The price typically increases as more tokens are purchased.","When enough users have bought the token and its market capitalization reaches $69,000, $12,000 of liquidity is deposited to the Solana decentralized exchange Raydium and burned. On Blast, the market cap requirement is $420,000, upon which $30,000 of liquidity is deposited to the Thruster DEX.","BaoBaoSol became the first token to graduate from the bonding curve to a liquidity pool on Raydium, with users spinning up tokens with any name under the sun in the hope of gaining memetic traction.","\u201CSo far, I've launched 182 pumpdotfun coins,\u201D one pseudonymous user, Sato, <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/Sartoshi0x\/status\/1776891604998988053\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claimed<\/a> on X. \u201CAbout 37 have made it to Raydium.

It's not as easy as people think.\u201D","Pump says it offers an alternative to existing token launches, which typically follow one of two paths: either directly deploying a token and establishing liquidity on a DEX like Raydium, with the minting authority then renounced and the liquidity provider token locked or burned, or conducting a presale where participants send funds to an address without immediate return.&nbsp;","This process can lead to high costs, including expensive set-up fees and the need for significant liquidity seeding. It also introduces complexity and risk, with presales vulnerable to scams, requiring advanced tools to monitor actions like the renouncement of token minting authority.","The Block reached out to Pump for comment.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Larry Cermak, CEO of The Block, is an angel investor in Blast.<\/em>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
