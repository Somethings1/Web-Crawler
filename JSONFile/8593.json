{"summary":"Curve token has bounced back from falling to a two-year low with a 50% rebound amid a squeeze on a big short position.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189167\/curve-token-jumps-50-amid-squeeze-on-big-short-position","publishDate":"2022-11-22T11:49:45","id":8593,"type":null,"title":"Curve token jumps 50% amid squeeze on big short position","category":["CRYPTO ECOSYSTEMS"],"content":["The price of the Curve DAO token (CRV) rallied significantly today in what appears to be a squeeze on a publicized short bet.","Data from CoinGecko shows the CRV price fell sharply this morning from $0.53 to $0.40, a decline of about 25% to the token's lowest level in two years. The sharp fall was followed immediately by a massive spike of more than 50% that saw CRV go as high as $0.61.","CRV is currently trading at $0.60 as of the time of publishing, posting a 17% price gain in the last 24 hours.","The volatile price action for CRV appears to be connected to a major short position on the token that saw a trader borrow a total of 92 million CRV from the DeFi lending platform Aave using $57 million in USDC as collateral. The trader had been selling the CRV tokens, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189028\/curve-dao-token-plunges-14-under-heavy-short-selling-pressure\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">previously reported by The Block<\/a>, which could have been responsible for the initial decline earlier in the day.","","","The price recovery now puts the short seller in danger of liquidation.
