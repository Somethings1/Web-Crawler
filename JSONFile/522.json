The audits reportedly uncovered a number of issues, most of which have been fixed.","Of the 45 issues found in OpenZeppelin's two previous audits, 40 have been resolved by the Matter Labs team, including two critical and two medium-severity issues, OpenZeppelin said in a statement shared with The Block.","The most recent audit, which concluded in December, focused on zkSync's system called \"bootloader\" as well as three more Layer 2 system smart contracts with corresponding interfaces and one library.","ZkSync is a ZK-rollup scaling solution that supports compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to offer developers the ability to port their apps from Ethereum mainnet to zkSync Layer 2 with low gas fees and high transaction speeds, without compromising on Ethereum's security.
