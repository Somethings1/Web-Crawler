The customizable blockchain will be designed to handle high volumes of zero-knowledge encrypted data efficiently and cost-effectively, according to a statement.","Masa previously <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/04\/masa-finance-gets-3-5m-pre-seed-to-build-its-decentralized-credit-protocol\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">secured<\/a> $3.5 million in pre-seed funding to build its decentralized credit data protocol in May 2022.","The subnet represents an expansion of Masa\u2019s existing data protocol. The project, the team says, aims to give users control back over their personal data and be compensated for its use. \u201CWe were doing credit data in early 2022, and then generalized the technology for all user data starting August 2022. This [subnet] for data analytics is more of an expansion in scope,\u201D a Masa spokesperson told The Block.","\u201CWe explored different options in the market when selecting the infrastructure to build a dedicated Masa blockchain,\u201D Masa co-founder Brendan Playford said. \u201CBuilding on Avalanche using AvaCloud, Masa is able to launch a gasless self-sovereign chain which enables high throughput of transactions and powers use cases that consume high volumes of private data \u2013 all at a low cost.\u201D","Masa is also receiving support from the Avalanche Foundation and investment from Avalanche\u2019s Blizzard Fund to help develop the platform. The investment amount was not disclosed. This comes after&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/267394\/nodekit-pre-seed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NodeKit<\/a> recently closed a $1.2 million pre-seed round to also build an Avalanche-based network for rollups.","Masa\u2019s system uses a zero-knowledge soulbound token (zkSBT) that acts as a personal data locker \u2014 a digital tool designed to securely manage and control an individual's personal data. It encrypts and stores individuals' digital footprints and social graphs to ensure privacy of their activity, such as participation in web3 communities or use of decentralized applications.","The team claims that over 890,000 user wallets have permissioned more than 8 million data events on Masa over the past year. With the launch of its zk-data marketplace, users will be able to view their information in their zkSBT locker and share that data in the marketplace via staking in return for compensation. For instance, users could allow financial institutions to access their Masa zkSBT for age verification without accessing their birth date.","\u201CThis is the perfect architecture to support our zk-data network and marketplace,\u201D Masa co-founder Calanthia Mei added. \u201CBy deploying on a dedicated Avalanche subnet, major financial institutions, AI startups, and large-scale consumer tech applications can access secure, scalable, zk-encrypted user data without paying any gas.\u201D","Masa argues that the proprietary silos of big tech companies exploit personal data without user consent or compensation \u2014 something that is worsened by the proliferation of AI as demand for peoples\u2019 personal data grows exponentially to train models and agents.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
