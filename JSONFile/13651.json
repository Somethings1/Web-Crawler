He is seeking an injunction to force the transfer through.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Patel further claims he suffered a loss of around $9.3 million because the price of bitcoin fell sharply between May and June, when the lawsuit was filed \u2013 and so is seeking damages equal to that sum or more.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis is a fast-paced area of the law that involves highly valuable assets often across multiple jurisdictions.
