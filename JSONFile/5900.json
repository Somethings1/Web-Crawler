The last time such a level was seen was in July 2021, when it peaked at 46.77%.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/prices\/bitcoin-dominance\/embed\" title=\"Bitcoin Dominance\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","In April of this year, Bitcoin dominance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221258\/bitcoin-dominance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">touched<\/a> 45.65% but had been swinging in a range. Since last week, however, its dominance has been on the rise. It comes at a time when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has declared several tokens as unregistered securities in its lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase \u2014 claiming that most tokens are securities. Since then, the prices of many mentioned tokens have declined. Meanwhile, bitcoin's price has been relatively stable.","The upcoming Bitcoin halving in April or May 2024 could also be a factor. The Bitcoin halving is an event that occurs approximately every four years, reducing the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks by half, effectively decreasing the rate at which new bitcoins are created, in order to control inflation and maintain the scarcity of bitcoin over time. The upcoming Bitcoin halving will see the block reward halve from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin.","The upcoming halving could help bitcoin reach a price of $45,000, JPMorgan analysts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232334\/bitcoin-price-45k-jpmorgan-gold\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">predicted<\/a> late last month.

MicroStrategy holds over 140,000 Bitcoin (nearly worth $3.5 billion at current prices) on its balance sheet.","Bitcoin's network activity has also been heavily boosted by the rise of tokens and NFTs through the Ordinals platform.","Â© 2023 The Block.
