Image: The Block's Price Pages.<\/span>","Bitfinex analysts said that one of the fundamental factors behind the recent price appreciation for the world's largest digital asset by market cap, \"includes the anticipation of a pause in the Fed's interest rate hikes.\"","\"Such a pause is expected to maintain or lower the benchmark overnight interest rate, which is one of the highest in US history. This situation could make risk assets like bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher returns in a lower interest rate environment,\" Bitfinex analysts told The Block.","However, the analysts added that other narratives are at play. \"Long-term bitcoin supply has continued to remain dormant while the lower timeframes currently show aggressive market participants chasing price, market buying, above the crucial $37,500 level. This resilience might also be reflecting in ether's performance, along with bitcoin steadily trading above $37,500.\" the analysts said.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
