Recent hawkish tones from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243813\/federal-reserve-increases-oversight-of-banking-crypto-ties\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Federal Reserve<\/a>, rising bond yields, and uncertainty in China are encouraging a risk-off sentiment.","\"Tighter monetary policy could be associated with reduced liquidity, greater dollar demand, and, potentially lower asset prices, particularly for assets that are thought of as dollar alternatives,\" Genesis trading head Gordon Grant told The Block.","At the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247508\/bitcoin-falls-after-feds-powell-takes-hawkish-tone-at-jackson-hole\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jackson Hole Symposium<\/a> on Friday, Fed chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed the central bank's commitment to monetary tightening until its 2% inflation target is reached.
