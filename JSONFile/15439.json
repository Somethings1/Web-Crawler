Ilya Lichtenstein, husband of criminal rapper Razzlekhan (aka Heather Morgan), confessed yesterday to the 2016 hacking theft of 120,000 bitcoins from offshore crypto exchange Bitfinex. But the circumstances of that confession are frankly bizarre \u2013 and one of America\u2019s most notorious reformed hackers isn\u2019t buying it.","\u201CIlya is a f***ing idiot,\u201D argues Brett Johnson. \u201CIf you look at the way he was trying to launder money, he was doing absolutely everything wrong.\u201D","This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","Johnson should know \u2013 he was the founder and leader of Shadow Crew, a notorious cybercrime cartel, in the early 2000s. After his arrest in 2005, Johnson served as a confidential informant for the Secret Service and, despite some backsliding, has since become a respected white hat cybersecurity expert.","Aside from questions about Lichtenstein\u2019s competence, the circumstances of the confession remain murky. The U.S. Department of Justice did not charge Morgan and Lichtenstein, who Morgan sometimes affectionately referred to as \u201CDutchie,\u201D with the hack itself, only with attempts to launder the stolen funds.","It is unclear from yesterday\u2019s reporting whether confession to the hack was a condition of Lichtenstein\u2019s plea deal on the money laundering charges, but that would be extremely unusual. The roughly 120,000 BTC hacked from Bitfinex was worth about $70 million in 2016, but ballooned to $4.3 billion by the time of the couple\u2019s arrest last year.","After Lichtenstein and Morgan\u2019s arrests, there were still many unanswered questions as to who actually committed the initial hack. One theory was that Lichtenstein and Morgan may have purchased keys to the stolen bitcoin from the original hacker at a discount, or were holding and laundering it on behalf of a third party. But these were never particularly convincing, and there was broad belief that the couple had committed the hack as well as the attempted laundering.","Brett Johnson is skeptical, though, based on Lichtenstein\u2019s apparent sloppiness on the laundering part of the heist.","\u201CHe was doing chain hopping \u2026 But the cashout was always coming out to his name. In Shadow Crew, we said, all cybercrime should start with identity theft,\u201D Johnson told me. \u201C[Lichtenstein] even had some Coinbase accounts that were directly connected to him. It simply did not make sense at all that he was doing it like that.\u201D","Lichtenstein also moved some of the stolen funds through darknet market Alphabay. But, Johnson argues, \u201CIf he had any experience at all, he knew that market was going to get shut down by law enforcement, or do an exit scam. So it doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201D","\u201CWhat it really reads like is, in theory the guy knows how to launder money, but in practice he had never done it at all,\u201D he added","Another major sign of the duo\u2019s questionable competence: Lichtenstein apparently kept the private keys to billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoin on a cloud drive, which may have allowed law enforcement to seize it.","See also: 'Razzlekhan,' Husband Agree to Plea Deal in Bitfinex Hack Case","More broadly, Razzlekhan and Dutchie\u2019s behavior post-2016 was strange for high-profile hackers. Rather than disappearing to some remote non-extradition country, they moved to Wall Street. And while Lichtenstein kept a low profile, Heather Morgan\u2019s behavior was incongruous with someone who had millions of stolen bitcoin on hand. She touted herself as head of an email marketing company, contributed articles to Forbes, gave public presentations on hacking and \u2013 last but not least\u2014pursued a possibly theft-subsidized career as a bizarre rapper under the alias \u201CRazzlekhan.\u201D","That may simply indicate that the couple made extremely na√Øve decisions after committing a major crime. But Brett Johnson thinks there\u2019s a lot more to the story.","\u201CIt doesn\u2019t ring very true to me at all.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Heather Morgan)","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2005","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Morgan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Brett Johnson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitfinex","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ilya","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Secret Service","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Johnson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$70 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Lichtenstein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Forbes","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Heather Morgan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitfinex Hack Case","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$4.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Razzlekhan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2000s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ilya Lichtenstein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Morgan","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","Bitfinex","cybercrime","Razzlekhan","The Node","Newsletters"],"authors":["David Z.
