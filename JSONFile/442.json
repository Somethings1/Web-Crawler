The current TVL of Yearn is around $455 million, and SushiSwap's TVL is about $730 million, according to tracker DeFi Pulse, making it Yearn's biggest merger thus far.","The protocol recently announced mergers with four other protocols \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/85585\/defi-merger-yearn-pickle-finance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pickle Finance<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/iearn\/yearn-cream-v2-merger-e9fa6c6989b4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cream Finance<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/iearn\/yearn-cover-merger-651142828c45\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cover<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/iearn\/%CE%BC%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD-%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1-yearn-x-akropolis-16f5351af35e\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Akropolis<\/a>.","Yearn founder Andre Cronje said the protocol's work with SushiSwap was overlapping, and thus it made sense to merge the two projects.","\"As Sushi focused on expanding their AMM [automated market maker] ecosystem, and as Yearn focused on expanding their strategies, more and more overlap became apparent, Yearn needed custom AMM experiences for their strategies, and Sushi started pushing the boundaries of yield and money markets,\" said Cronje. \"With these overlaps, more and more work started to become mutualistic, and at this point, it makes to take the relationship to the next level.\"","SushiSwap will also help Yearn develop and launch its upcoming project, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/85431\/yearn-finance-founder-andre-cronje-introduces-new-defi-protocol-deriswap\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Deriswap<\/a>, which would combine different segments of DeFi \u2014 swaps, options, and loans \u2014 into one platform.","\"Yearn will participate in Sushi governance and add to its treasury some SUSHI.
