(DCG owns CoinDesk.)","Gemini said it had no comment on the filing.","The Gemini Earn program was launched in February 2021. It allowed the exchange\u2019s retail customers to earn yields of up to 7.4% by lending their crypto assets to Genesis. The implosion of 3AC in June 2022 harmed Genesis, whose position became even worse after crypto exchange FTX\u2019s collapse in November 2022. Gemini had to halt withdrawals from the Earn program that month, and Genesis filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 19, 2023.","DCG called Gemini\u2019s July complaint a continuation of a \u201Cpublic relations campaign\u201D carried out by the exchange\u2019s owners, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and \u201Can effort to deflect blame by contriving a public, Twitter-based character assassination campaign against Defendant DCG (Genesis\u2019 indirect parent) and Silbert (DCG\u2019s founder) \u2014 neither of whom operated, oversaw or had any substantive involvement with the Gemini Earn program.\u201D","DCG also said Genesis \u201Cis not a defendant here,\u201D claiming that \u201CGemini actively encouraged its existing customers to lend their digital assets (including cryptocurrencies) to Genesis in exchange for interest, representing to its customers that it was a sophisticated market participant and that it had thoroughly vetted Genesis.\u201D","A critical component of Gemini\u2019s complaint concerns claims that DCG and Silbert assured the Winklevoss twins, during a meeting in the summer of last year that DCG had absorbed a $1.1 billion hole left in the Genesis balance sheet caused by the 3AC collapse. The Winklevoss twins claim the loan, a 10-year promissory note at 1% interest, was misrepresented to them as a short-term receivable that could be cashed out in a year.","DCG, in its dismissal, said Gemini \u201Cdoes not explain\u201D why the representation made by Silbert at a lunch meeting with a Gemini co-founder was fraudulent. On Thursday, DCG entered the promissory note into the court docket of the case.","Although Gemini initially filed its lawsuit in New York\u2019s State Supreme Court, DCG successfully shifted it to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, court records show.","\u201CAt its core, the lawsuit is a continuation of the Winklevoss\u2019 yearlong Twitter-based character assassination and public relations campaign against DCG and Barry Silbert to deflect blame from their own mismanagement,\u201D a representative for DCG said via email.","UPDATE (Aug. 10, 2023, 16:28 UTC): Adds that Gemini declined to comment and the fact that DCG filed the controversial promissory note mentioned in the case.","Edited by Nick Baker and Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gemini","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"7.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Jan. 19, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Barry Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Defendant DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York\u2019s State Supreme Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cameron","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aug. 10, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"July 7","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Genesis \u201C","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Winklevoss twins","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tyler Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"summer of last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"the Southern District of New York","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Winklevoss","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["DCG","Digital Currency Group","Barry Silbert","Cameron Winklevoss","Tyler Winklevoss","Lawsuit","Gemini"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
