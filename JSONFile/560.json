These signatures, when malicious, grant attackers access to the victim\u2019s funds without their knowledge.","Phishing attacks can be a major concern because signing only one malicious signature may result in the loss of all assets stored in a wallet.","Scam Sniffer's analysis also shed light on the tactics used by these cybercriminals, noting that a large number of victims were lured to phishing sites through deceptive comments on social media platforms, particularly Twitter. These comments, posing as legitimate accounts, attempt to direct users to malicious sites where their assets are compromised.","\u201CMost victims were lured to phishing websites through phishing comments from impersonated Twitter accounts,\u201D Scam Sniffer noted.&nbsp;","The total funds lost by users to crypto phishing attacks amounted to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270105\/crypto-phishing-attacks-2023\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$300 million<\/a> during all of 2023."],"hashtag":["EXPLOITS","HACKS"]}
