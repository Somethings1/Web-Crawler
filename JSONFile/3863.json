Ocean Protocol\u2019s token, OCEAN, has seen the biggest rise, up more than 36% over the past 24 hours, according to The Block\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/256935\/ocean-protocol-ocean-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">price page<\/a>.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OCEAN\/USD price chart. Image: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/256935\/ocean-protocol-ocean-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block\/TradingView<\/a>.<\/span>","The deal aims to create the largest open-sourced, independent player in AI research and development, according to a statement shared with The Block. The teams said the rationale for the move was to capitalize on the rise of AI and growth of the three AI projects, create a decentralized infrastructure at scale and accelerate investment into AI.","\u201CWe can deliver on the promise of a vertically integrated stack of decentralized technologies while gaining scale to compete globally. The combination of our technologies creates a leader in R&amp;D, applications and commercialization of AGI,\u201D Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol CEO and co-founder, said. \u201CThe unified ASI token is the glue to orchestrate all actors with common incentives. ASI tokens are used to secure the public network, as data access tokens and to unlock computation without needing traditional banking and payment rails. It\u2019s the native currency for the machine economy.\u201D","The three projects are due to submit integration proposals to the respective governance communities today for a 14-day consultation period. Voting on the proposal is then anticipated to take place between April 2 and April 16.","If the proposals are approved by each community, FET will become ASI with a total supply of 2.63 billion tokens and a starting price of $2.82. AGIX and OCEAN will migrate to ASI at a conversion rate of 0.43335 to 1 and 0.433226 to 1, respectively. The newly merged ASI token would have a fully diluted value of $7.5 billion at current prices.","\u201CIn a world of exploding AI innovation, the giants of Big Tech dominate the headlines and conversations. We\u2019re forging a different path. Our mission is to combine our platforms to ensure ethical and transparent artificial intelligence to decentralize AI,\u201D Humayun Sheikh, Fetch.ai CEO and Founder and early DeepMind investor, said. \u201CDecentralized AI facilitates direct interactions between developers and users, bypassing the traditional gatekeepers of centralized authorities. This enhances data privacy and paves the way for a more democratic and trustworthy AI ecosystem and encourages global participants to contribute.\u201D","A governing council for the \u201CSuperintelligence Collective\u201D would be established to \u201Cmonitor and guide the operations of the merged tokenomic network.\u201D The Superintelligence Collective would be led by SingularityNET founder Dr. Ben Goertzel as CEO, with Fetch.ai founder Humayun Sheikh taking on the role of Chairman and Bruce Pon and Trent McConaghy representing Ocean Protocol.","\u201CThe organizations helping guide the development of the three merging networks, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol Foundation and SingularityNET Foundation, will continue to operate as separate entities but will collaborate closely in the shared ASI tokenomic ecosystem and the operation of the Superintelligence Collective,\u201D the teams said.","\u201CIt is imperative, as the AI revolution intensifies, to ensure that AGI and ASI as they develop are not owned and controlled by any particular party with its biased interests. They should be rolled out in an open, democratic and decentralized way,\u201D Dr. Ben Goertzel, Founder and CEO of SingularityNET added. \u201CThis has been the joint vision of SingularityNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol from their inception, and for this reason, it makes total sense that our three projects come together to form a tokenomic network that has greater power to take on Big Tech and shift the center of gravity of the AI world into the decentralized ecosystem.\u201D","A community joint call is scheduled to take place on an X Spaces tomorrow at 4 p.m. ET to discuss the pending merger.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
