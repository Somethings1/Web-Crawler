This would indicate a 75.9% decrease since the beginning of the year.","\"Decreasing hashprice and a lack of new capital coming into mining has put significant downward pressure on ASIC prices. They have affected both primary and secondary markets,\" Lin said. \"Bitmain\u2019s reduction in pricing on S19 Pros is one part of this, and has led to decreasing prices of over 10% across the board for new-generation machines.\"","Going forward, Luxor expects there to be \"resistance lines\" in the mid- to high teens per TH, \"with strong buy walls at that level,\", said Lin.","Bitmain also said that customers that bought S19 Pro machines with scheduled deliveries in the third and fourth quarters of this year would be eligible for discount coupons.","A couple of other models are also included in this deal, namely S19 Pro Hyd and S19 Pro+ Hyd.
