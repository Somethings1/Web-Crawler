This comes amid a spate of infighting related to previous departures.","\u201CI am going to ship Trident, and if you do not give us the autonomy to continue operations, the capability to form leadership, and increase compensation across the board I will leave,\u201D he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/josephdelong\/status\/1467498535419625472?t=ERXwpWPf_LyCAM115HgMeA&amp;s=19\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> on Sunday. Trident refers to a new type of DEX that SushiSwap is working on.","To understand what led to this warning requires a look at how SushiSwap\u2019s leadership has evolved over the last year.","SushiSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that was originally forked from Uniswap. It was known for using a vampire attack to try to tempt Uniswap\u2019s user base to switch to it instead. It did so by incentivizing new users with token rewards.","In September 2020, SushiSwap hit notoriety when one of its founders, Chef Nomi, took funds intended for the project\u2019s development team and sold them for ether (ETH), sparking a sell-off. He later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/77587\/sushiswap-founder-eth-project-treasury\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">returned the $14 million<\/a> and was apologetic. But this led to a temporary shift in control of the project to other well-known individuals like FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, before ultimately landing in the hands of an individual known as 0xMaki.&nbsp;","One year later, 0xMaki <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.sushi.com\/t\/transition-into-advisor\/5533\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> his departure. He said the project had taken a toll on him and that he planned to relax a bit. He was wondering about writing a book on what happened at SushiSwap from the inside. He also said he would remain an advisor to the project.&nbsp;","Near the end of his post, he said, \u201CI\u2019ve accepted this decision and am at peace mentally.\u201D","But it appears that it was a decision he was forced to make. A <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/makibacknow\/status\/1463078678724632576\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">leaked screenshot<\/a> from a SushiSwap telegram group seems to show Delong asking whether the project should ask Maki to leave, with 91% of the 11 respondents in favor of the move. Furthermore, a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/makibacknow\/status\/1463768722217349122\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">now-deleted post<\/a> on the SushiSwap forum alleged that 0xMaki was fired.&nbsp;","\u201CWith the $SUSHI price already down anyway, time for a little thread about the shenanigans behind the scenes at Sushi. @0xMaki was kicked out. Most of the good devs have left. Seems like greed sadly has taken over from community,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Boring_Crypto\/status\/1467162233905893379\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> BoringCrypto, a former non-core SushiSwap developer.&nbsp;","BoringCrypto named three other developers that they believed had also left: 0xKeno, LevX and Mudit Gupta. 0xKeno has left the project, according to his Twitter bio, while LevX appears to now be working on an NFT project. Mudit Gupta, for his part, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Mudit__Gupta\/status\/1467171799477616645\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> he left the core team but remains an advisor.","Following these public allegations, Delong wrote a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/josephdelong\/status\/1467498481573052427\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweet thread<\/a> to try to answer what he described as \u201Cabsurd defamation.\u201D","Delong said it was wrong that Gupta left due to his leadership, saying that it took him four and a half months to find a developer of his quality.","The CTO did acknowledge that some former team members didn't like him. For these people, he said, \u201CMost of them were asked to leave on a basis of poor performance or inability to collaborate with the team which is the case with BoringCrypto.\u201D","Delong fired more hits at BoringCrypto, claiming the developer had built products at SushiSwap only to sell them to his other crypto project, known as Magic Internet Money.","Ultimately, Delong said that if the community did not back the current team, he would leave.&nbsp;","\u201CI will peacefully transfer all the accounts and go and build something equally as successful and you can find someone else to bully,\u201D he added.","Delong further claimed that he wasn\u2019t well compensated, at $300,000 for a year\u2019s work. \u201CThat may seem like a lot but I took a pay cut leaving Dapper Labs to come work on Sushi because it seemed exciting,\u201D he said. He <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/josephdelong\/status\/1467609829715939331\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">added<\/a> that the SushiSwap core team had few sushi (SUSHI) tokens between them.","To prove his point, Delong <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.sushi.com\/t\/bridge-compensation-for-sushi-core\/6217\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposed<\/a> to SushiSwap\u2019s governance system that all of the core team \u2014 barring himself \u2014 should be compensated with a one-off payment of 200,000 SUSHI ($964,000) from the project\u2019s treasury. The tokens would have no vesting or lock up periods, so members could sell immediately if they wished. Among the 19 individuals listed, the amount handed out would total $18.3 million.","At present, 68% of the 79 voters are against the proposal.&nbsp;","\u201CThis was a test to show less than 1% of the issuance going to the core team is controversial. You failed [by the way],\u201D Delong <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/josephdelong\/status\/1467628239241756672\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>.","On December 5, the SushiSwap team made an <a href=\"https:\/\/hackmd.io\/ipJtfxhuQmqW9B8igew_AA?view\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">official statement<\/a> about the current mudslinging. The statement said that a former member known as AG \u2014 once SushiSwap\u2019s Asia lead \u2014 was dismissed on the basis of unprofessional behavior and that they were behind many of these recent tweets (such as those alleging 0xMaki was fired).&nbsp;","The statement acknowledged the difficulties of operating a project through a decentralized structure, particularly when it comes to accountability and transparency.","\u201CWe agree and admit that there were mistakes made,\u201D said the statement. \u201CGoing forward, we are committed to involve the community in larger decisions, and create more transparency with the community.\u201D","<i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For more breaking stories like this, make sure to follow The Block on&nbsp;<\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a><\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/i>","Â© 2023 The Block.
