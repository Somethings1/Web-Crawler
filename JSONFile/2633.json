The event will swap Ethereum\u2019s consensus approach from proof of work to proof of stake.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It will also lay the groundwork for future scaling upgrades on Ethereum. During the upgrade codenamed \"Paris,\" miners will stop producing blocks, and validators will take over this task.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Getting to The Merge has taken years of work as swapping consensus is a complicated task. For this reason, Ethereum developers spent years coding and later conducted a series of rehearsals in order to prepare.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum currently exists as two chains: the proof-of-work mainnet (execution layer), and the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain (consensus layer). <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During The Merge, these two will become inextricably linked. When that happens, the first block after The Merge will be finalized using proof of stake consensus. The process is considered complex and could encounter unforeseen issues or minor technical glitches, Ethereum core members have previously stated.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In fact, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake said in an<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/6212184\/justin-drake-ethereum-merge\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interview<\/span><\/a> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">with Time that he anticipated general technical glitches. Drake clarified that such glitches will not pose a systemic risk to the upgrade or the project.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So what are these issues that Ethereum may potentially have to face during The Merge? <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Isidoros Passadis, master of validators at Lido Finance, has classified them into multiple types. The first type, according to Passadis, can be general technical glitches common with software upgrades.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWith any software upgrade, we have to anticipate possible bugs, technical glitches, or general hiccups. This is reasonable anticipation and one the community needs to make peace with,\u201D Passadis said in a statement shared with The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another possible issue relates to the ability of Ethereum nodes to actually execute the upgrade. Passadis said that the possibility that nodes may fail during the transition is not out of the question.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For the Merge to be successful, the majority of node operators would have to come to a consensus and be synced with each other. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Every node runs a client to interact with the Ethereum network to broadcast and verify transactions. If this process is interrupted due to bugs in client software, The Merge could be potentially disrupted.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During previous dress rehearsals for The Merge, client teams uncovered bugs that caused some nodes to temporarily fail or skip blocks.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To counter the effects of the failure of one client, Ethereum developers have adopted the strategy of \u201Cclient diversity\u201D where the chain relies on multiple types of client software used to run nodes. This reduces the chances of a complete failure of The Merge. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The clients on the execution layer include Geth, Erigon, Besu and Nethermind. Meanwhile, the Beacon Chain uses Teku, Prysm, Nimbus and Lighthouse as clients.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Ethereum has undergone three testnet Merges, numerous shadow forks and there are multiple client teams working alongside each other to implement the code successfully,\" Passadis clarified.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Anthony Sassano, the founder of ETHHub, explained in a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YcMJmLedD-4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">YouTube video<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> node issues may ultimately be a \u201Cnothingburger.\u201D Sassano later clarified that as long as a majority of node operators participate, the Merge will be finalized.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The upgrade, according to Sassano, will require a minimum participation of 66% Ethereum node operators on both layers. So, even if there\u2019s a bug affecting one client software, other clients can sustain the network against an outage.<\/span>"],"hashtag":["ETHEREUM"]}
