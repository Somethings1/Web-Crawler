The company was founded by Bebo founder Furqan Rydhan and entrepreneur Steven Bartlett of Dragon's Den UK.&nbsp;","Thirdweb offers pre-built smart contracts to create products ranging from NFT drops to a&nbsp; marketplace, software development kits (SDKs) to build products from the ground up and a dashboard for developer teams to track and manage on-chain contracts. The company says that the products it offers are fully non-custodial and on-chain.&nbsp;","\"As a developer, when you're thinking about web3, the first problem is everything is different than I have learned previously... if I want to create a token or an NFT or a wallet, how do I get started?,\" said Furqan Rydhan in an interview with The Block. \"Smart contracts are also a lot more sensitive than developing for traditional internet software where 'move fast, ship fast and break things' was the developer motto \u2014 a mistake on the blockchain could cost you $100 million.\"&nbsp;","While Thirdweb counts web3 entities \u2014 DAOs, multi-sig wallets and on-chain teams \u2014 brands such as New York Fashion Week and Afterpay are also using its services to build web3 services such as NFT-gated membership clubs and tickets, virtual metaverse-like worlds with the aim of increasing fan engagement.&nbsp;","Rydhan also cited a car company that is currently using its products to build an NFT waiting list for its new model release.&nbsp;","Currently, its services are available on the Ethereum, Avalanche and Fantom blockchains, however, it's currently readying Solana integration with a tentative launch date of end of September. It plans to use the funding to add further blockchains such as Cosmos, Near and Flow.&nbsp;","Rydhan also claimed that with this raise the company now has over three years of runway with 60-70% still left over from its seed raise $5 million back in December of last year.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
