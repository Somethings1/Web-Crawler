Equivalent bills in the U.S. have failed to gain political traction.","Europe is \u201Cshowing us with Web3 they're ahead of the game of the United States,\u201D despite the European Union\u2019s stumbles on previous internet technology, McHenry said. \u201CThat should send chills up the spines of Americans, because economic growth comes out of that technology ingenuity.\u201D","\u201CThat the Europeans have a technology-forward law line here shows how behind the United States is,\u201D he added. \u201CWe should be the leader of the world when it comes to technology deployment, not running second to Europe.\u201D","McHenry was optimistic about prospects for his bills on stablecoins and crypto market structure, despite criticism from Democrats. In the meantime, many crypto players have been left operating in a legal gray area.","During a hearing last week, McHenry urged Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler to take a clear position on whether individual crypto assets such as ether (ETH) constitute regulated securities or commodities.","EU officials have urged other leading jurisdictions to follow the lead taken by MiCA to ensure consistent global protection. During an April 19 debate, members of the European Parliament said the law would end the \u201CWild West\u201D of unregulated crypto and restore confidence lost following the crash of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange.","On Tuesday, MiCA also won plaudits from the U.K., where lawmaker Lisa Cameron, who chairs a cross-party grouping on crypto issues, said MiCA was a \"significant positive step\" toward regulatory clarity, which can provide a \"useful blueprint\" for the U.K.'s own crypto law.","Read more: Why the EU Has MiCA and the U.S. Has Securities Law Confusion","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"European Parliament","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R\u2013N.C.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"European Union","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"First Mover\"","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"McHenry urged Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MiCA","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lisa Cameron","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"McHenry","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Patrick McHenry","House Financial Services Committee","U.S.","EU","MiCA","CoinDesk TV"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
