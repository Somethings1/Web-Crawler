Critics of this state of affairs say that it impedes the use of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment due to the tax burden involved.&nbsp;","The goal of the new bill is to exempt transactions involving cryptocurrencies if the calculated gain in question is below $200. As the bill states:","\"Gross income of an individual shall not include gain, by reason of changes in exchange rates, from the disposition of virtual currency in a personal transaction (as such term is defined in section 11 988(e)). The preceding sentence shall not apply if the gain which would otherwise be recognized on the transaction exceeds $200.\"","If approved, the bill would cover transactions taking place after December 31, 2019.","The language and intent of the bill is similar to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/us-lawmakers-seek-tax-exemption-bitcoin-transactions-600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a 2017 effort<\/a> in Congress, also sponsored by Schweikert along with then-Rep. Jared Polis, though in that case, the proposed law would have exempted transactions at a floor of $600 in gains.","Coin Center, which has pushed for the&nbsp;<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">de minimis&nbsp;<\/em>exemption as part of its work on Capitol Hill, said Thursday that \"this easy solution to an obvious problem with today\u2019s tax treatment of cryptocurrencies would help level the playing field for this technology.\"","As The Block's Aislinn Keely <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/53173\/crypto-is-taking-hold-in-congress-but-2020-elections-will-likely-slow-down-legislation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported this week<\/a>, there is growing momentum around legislation that focuses on cryptocurrency and blockchain. But the unique pressures of an election hear \u2013 let alone one that includes the presidency \u2013 could act as a roadblock to meaningful progress on proposed bills.&nbsp;","That said, the new bill \u2013 along with past proposed measures like Rep. Tom Emmer's Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets Act \u2013 further illustrates what is perhaps sustained interest in legislative moves on the tax front.&nbsp;","&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
