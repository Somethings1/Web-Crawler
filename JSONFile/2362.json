Both businesses have advertised advancements in the sector in recent months.","In July, London-based wallet provider Wirex became the first native crypto firm to be granted a principal membership license by Mastercard \u2014 a development that came not long after the collapse of Wirex\u2019s former payments partner Wirecard. Mastercard said in a press statement at the time that the expansion of its crypto efforts would make it \u201Csimpler and faster for partners to bring secure, compliant\u201D cards to market.","Not to be outdone, Visa announced the expansion of its Fast Track programme in November, giving a wider range of fintech firms access to its network of 61 million merchants. Crypto.com and eToro, both UK-based, were identified as crypto partners that had been given the green light.","\u201CVisa is committed to being the preferred network for crypto wallets. Fast Track is really the first step for having an easy way for having a next generation and new wave of issuers to be able to come to us and get card programmes off the ground,\u201D said Sheffield.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nBefore getting off the ground, however, crypto companies must convince the card networks that the crypto they hold \u2013 which they convert into fiat money when a customer tries to pay for something using their card \u2013 arrived on their platform from a reputable source.","\u201CThey give you a heightened review process which is effectively, \u2018I want to see everything you put towards your regulators in terms of anti-money laundering\u2019,\u201D said Mark Hipperson, whose London-based crypto wallet and exchange platform Ziglu recently launched a Mastercard debit card. This includes information on \u2018know your customer\u2019, anti-money laundering and fraud checks, as well as transaction monitoring.","Wirex chief executive Pavel Matveev, who has experience working with both Visa and Mastercard, said Visa homes in on individual transactions using tools such as Chainalysis and Elliptic \u2013 which Wirex also uses \u2013 to ask whether they originate from \u201Clegitimate sources\u201D.","\u201CThey both [Visa and Mastercard] ask about how we store crypto, what security measures we have in place, what are our screening policies, but it\u2019s fair to say that Visa goes a bit deeper. They even ask about specific cryptocurrency transactions\u2026 which was quite surprising for us to be honest,\u201D he said.","A Mastercard spokesperson pointed to principles established in October 2019, which dictate that the company\u2019s crypto partners must provide \u201Cstrong consumer protection, including privacy and security of the consumers\u2019 information and transactions\u201D.","These principles also require \u201Cfull compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those applicable to anti-money laundering,\u201D according to the company.","Â© 2023 The Block.
