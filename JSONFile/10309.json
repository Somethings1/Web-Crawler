He will be staying on as an adviser to the company.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Roberts' departure comes amid something of a crypto industry exodus. Several executives have left crypto firms in recent weeks. Earlier this week, The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174513\/ftxs-head-of-otc-and-institutional-sales-has-quietly-left-the-firm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that FTX's head of OTC and institutional sales Jonathan Cheesman had quietly left the firm. Last month, FTX.US president Brett Harrison stepped back to an advisory role. In the same month, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell stepped down to make way for incoming CEO David Ripley. Bitcoin investment services firm NYDIG\u2019s CEO Robert Gutmann and president Yan Zhao also left the company last week.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reasons behind the moves may vary, but they all come amid difficult market conditions. Bitcoin's price has declined more than 70% from last November's all-time highs of around $69,000 to about $19,500 today.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NFT trading volumes have also declined sharply in recent months. Last month, there was a drop of about 18% in trading volume on Ethereum-based NFT marketplaces to $504 million, according to data from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/september-by-the-numbers-2-174035\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block Research<\/a>.<\/span>","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/nft-marketplace-monthly-volume\/embed\" title=\"NFT Marketplace Monthly Volume\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, saw its volumes drop more than 30% last month. Roberts said in his LinkedIn update that he remained \"incredibly bullish on web3 and especially OpenSea.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The company is heads down building and I assure you, the best is yet to come,\" he added.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OpenSea is backed by high-profile investors, including Paradigm and Coatue.
