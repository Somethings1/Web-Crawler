This brings the total amount staked by the company to 28,000 ETH ($44.2 million), or about 62% of its total ETH<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> holdings.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite setbacks that may have given some the impression that \u201Cupgrades are never going to ship,\u201D Mosoff takes the position the successful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169299\/ethereum-activates-the-merge-as-it-shifts-to-proof-of-stake\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum Merge<\/a> should have \u201Cput those ideas to bed.\u201D<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt's not important if they happen on time or get delayed,\u201D said Mosoff, adding, \u201DThe reality is developers are in the business of shipping things when they're going to work,\u201D as opposed to timelines imposed by the profit-driven expectations of investors.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For its long-term goals, Ether Capital aims to stake as much as 100% of its ETH when possible, although there is \u201Cno rush to get there,\u201D said Mosoff.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, the company\u2019s capacity to provide accounting, reporting, and back office monitoring leaves Ether Capital well positioned to go \u201Cfull steam ahead on ETH staking,\u201D according to Mosoff.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As \u201Cone of the most important and technically complex upgrades in crypto history or in any Internet protocol,\u201D the Ethereum Merge served as a catalyst that potentially unlocked sidelined institutional capital, Mosoff noted.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Indeed, The Merge introduced the capacity to stake ETH in lieu of proof-of-work mining as a means of consensus. However as of now, any staked ETH cannot be unstaked until a much-anticipated Shanghai goes live, scheduled for March.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Once it is possible to stake and unstake ETH, creating liquidity outside of current liquid staked ETH token offerings, Mosoff reckons that institutional perspectives of the ecosystem will begin to change. \u201CI think that people will, from an institutional standpoint, be excited about ETH once it has liquidity,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But for some organizations, that enthusiasm has been quashed as institutions that were avidly watching for entry points into crypto may be more likely to be sidelined at present following the bust of multiple trustworthy platforms at the end of 2022, said Mosoff. This could stay the case until comfort levels return.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For those that manage to allocate assets into crypto, Mosoff said he doesn\u2019t expect every Exchange-Traded Fund or family office to custody their own assets and run a multi-signature contract like Ether Capital. However, at minimum, \u201Cthey should be thinking about diversification.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere isn't meaningful insurance in this space. I know that some custodians say that there's insurance on the hot wallet, insurance on the Cold Wallet, but when you really start reading the terms, you realize that some of these custodians may be holding tens, you know, $30, $40, $50 billion-plus of crypto assets, but there's only a few hundred million [dollars] of cover,\u201D said Mosoff. This sometimes may be covered by the company\u2019s own balance sheet.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the case an insurer without sufficient coverage goes under, with losses in the billions, \u201CI'm not sure that a few hundred million dollars is going to go a long way,\u201D said Mosoff. The best form of insurance, he said, comes either via self-custody following best industry practices and procedures, or integrating multiple custodians and staking providers with a means to holistically monitor them.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the future, \u201Cthere's more likely a scenario where the businesses fail and the tokens do well over the next five or 10 years,\u201D said Mosoff, estimating Bitcoin may trade around $100,000 with ETH trading between $5,000\u2013$10,000.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What does the next cycle hold? \u201CThe age of tokenization of actual real world assets,\u201D said Mosoff, meaning where those assets begin to manifest in markets like Uniswap or others like it. Amid a full spectrum of crypto-native activities, he said that banks and governments will build stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mosoff doesn\u2019t foresee Ether Capital diversifying beyond ETH in terms of crypto allocation. \u201CI don't see us wavering from that in terms of Treasury exposure,\u201D said Mosoff. \u201CI just don't think that that's part of our DNA.\u201D<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Correction: Mosoff's name was corrected throughout this story.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
