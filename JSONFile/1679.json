In each collection, the bids that take the highest \u201Crisk\u201D earn most reward points.","As of the time of writing, if you wanted to buy a Doodles NFT, the top bid for more than ten items in that collection sits at 5.07 ETH (about $7,900), whereas the 'buy now' price is 5.03 ETH. It's the same story for other collections, including Bored Ape Yacht Club, Azuki and Moonbird NFTs.","When a bid is made on a listed item, the seller has to accept it before the transaction goes through \u2014 whereas a buyer would trigger the transaction for the 'buy now' items.&nbsp;","Blur's CEO Tieshun Roquerre, also known as Pacman, said the discrepancy between the bid and the ask is a result of a \"spread\" and the \"fees\" charged.&nbsp;","Of course, the fees tacked onto a transaction set against the rewards for listing and bidding may mean the reverse arbitrage of the current market might not be as bad as it looks. For example, you might pay $20 in transaction fees on Ethereum and a $70 royalty fee back to the artist when a sale goes through.","<script async=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/script>","\"Most traders currently bidding on NFTs on Blur probably just assume that the rewards they'll receive will outweigh the costs incurred,\" said Thomas Bialek, research analyst at The Block Research.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updates with new headline and Blur CEO's comments discrepancy between the bid and ask on the marketplace.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["BLUR"]}
