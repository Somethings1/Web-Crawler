But he made it clear that the firm sees a future in this area.","\u201CWe don\u2019t have any one thing that we\u2019re sure makes sense to commercialize yet,\u201D Saylor remarked. \u201CBut we think there\u2019s an entire exploding universe of intelligence opportunities all wrapped around this unique bitcoin intelligence coming off the blockchain. And we\u2019ll explore it all and look for efficient, artful ways to integrate it into our existing business and deploy it.\u201D","Later on the call, MicroStrategy chief technology officer Tim Lang said that the company is assembling a \u201Cscrum team\u201D it has committed to look at potential offerings. \u201CIt\u2019s a nearly-formed team that we\u2019re putting in place for this,\u201D he explained.","He went on to explain that this exploratory process isn\u2019t limited to potential products \u2014 rather, it will also include experimentation with the integration of the tech into MicroStrategy\u2019s platform itself.","\u201CThe ability to kind of leverage some of the techniques that bitcoin has as well as itself could actually be key to some of the future modernizations of our platform,\u201D said Lang. \u201CSo, there\u2019s the immediate pieces we see, in terms of analytics on bitcoin. But there\u2019s also how we could potentially leverage the chain at the core of the platform, and we\u2019re evaluating those pieces.\u201D"],"hashtag":["BITCOIN","MICROSTRATEGY"]}
