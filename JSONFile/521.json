The proliferation of AI and generative software have, according to Worldcoin, rendered the issue of online identity that much thornier.&nbsp;","Described in today\u2019s announcement as the \u201Cunderlying identity protocol\u201D to Worldcoin and powered by zero-knowledge cryptography, the newly launched World ID is a mobile tool that people can use to prove they\u2019re real without sacrificing anonymity. Worldcoin\u2019s Orb \u2014 a controversial, iris-scanning bit of hardware \u2014 is the main method of getting verified for users. Still, they can also use tools such as phone number verification, albeit with less accuracy.","\u201CThis is a decentralized and privacy-first protocol,\u201D Tiago Sada, Head of Product, Engineering and Design at Tools For Humanity, told The Block in an interview. \u201CWhat that means is that just like people can have self-custodial wallets, with this, people can have self-custodial IDs, where any information is on-device, and how you use it is through zero-knowledge-proofs to make attestations about yourself.\u201D","Users can get a World ID on any compatible mobile wallet. One option is the World App, which is still in beta.","Orb verification is primarily limited to Argentina, Chile, India, Kenya, Portugal and Spain, though a broader rollout of these devices will happen later this year. Mobile verification, meanwhile, is available in most countries.","The Orb has proven divisive. Its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/tech\/2021\/06\/30\/gaze-into-the-orb-to-collect-your-worldcoin\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">unveiling<\/a> in June 2021 drew sharp <a href=\"https:\/\/decrypt.co\/84277\/snowden-slams-sam-altman-worldcoin-eyeball-scan-for-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">backlash<\/a> from leading privacy advocates, including Edward Snowden, who warned, \u201CDon\u2019t catalogue eyeballs.\u201D Worldcoin later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.biometricupdate.com\/202204\/worldcoin-adds-layer-of-privacy-to-biometric-cryptocurrency-after-disapproval\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sought<\/a> to assuage those concerns by removing links between the biometric registration stage and the wallet with the help of zero-knowledge-proof technology. Sada thinks concerns about the project persist, however.","\u201CThere\u2019s also a lot of misconceptions out there,\u201D he said. \u201CA lot of people don\u2019t know that your biometric data gets destroyed at the Orb.\u201D That is, unless you opt-in to having your biometric data stored, which, though not incentivized by Worldcoin, helps improve the protocol.","\u201CThe iris code is the only thing that leaves the device,\u201D Sada continued. \u201CAs counterintuitive as this sounds, World ID is\u2026 the most private identity. I would argue that it\u2019s also the most inclusive and scalable in many ways.\u201D","His argument hinges on the idea that traditional Know Your Customer checks (KYC) involve giving up a great deal more personal information in the form of ID scans \u2014 while many people don\u2019t have an ID to give up in the first place.","Sada also said that if there was a better tool for proving a person\u2019s uniqueness, Worldcoin would readily abandon the Orb, given the constraints of manufacturing hardware. Indeed, Tools for Humanity has a team actively searching for such a solution.","For now, though, the Orb rollout continues. Worldcoin is ramping up Orb distribution through an <a href=\"https:\/\/worldcoin.org\/blog\/worldcoin\/what-is-worldcoin-operator\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">operator program<\/a> that compensates businesses for getting people scanned. It currently has 1.3 million sign-ups, according to today\u2019s announcement.","Worldcoin singled out sign-on as the simplest use case for World ID. Other potential use cases for its technology include bot protection and moderation in social networks; voting in DAOs; supporting uncollateralized lending; loyalty programs and coupons; reviews on marketplaces; and welfare distribution. Its first showcase for the tech will focus on verification for Discord, a social network popular with crypto projects.","\u201CIt probably takes the imagination of a lot more people to think of what you could do with this. When the iPhone was introduced, you wouldn\u2019t have imagined Uber,\u201D Sada said. \u201CIt\u2019s a fundamental primitive. It will exist. And Worldcoin is about making sure that it exists in a decentralized and privacy-serving way.\u201D","As for the SDK, developers have been invited to register for a waitlist to get early access to a beta version of the product, which is open to anyone and includes a web widget, developer portal, development simulator, examples and guides.","Worldcoin is valued at $3 billion after reportedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/andreessen-horowitz-khosla-back-worldcoin-in-deal-valuing-tokens-at-3-billion?rc=8uivwi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raising<\/a> $100 million from Khosla Ventures and a16z in March 2022. The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210014\/sam-altman-worldcoin-fundraise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">revealed<\/a> in February that the company is seeking another round of funding at the same valuation. The company has earmarked the first half of this year for the launch of its token."],"hashtag":["DECENTRALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE","IDENTITY","INTERNET"]}
