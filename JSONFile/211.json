The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/7035314-Complaint.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">published<\/a>&nbsp;court documents state that the U.S. government is seeking the forfeiture of 155 bitcoin address accounts.&nbsp;","In a separate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/opa\/press-release\/file\/1304296\/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">court<\/a> action, prosecutors went after the al-Qassam operated network, which involved the use of two websites as well as five accounts held at an unnamed \"financial institution.\" The complaint identified \"fifty-three virtual currency accounts\" and \"one hundred twenty-seven virtual currency properties\" for seizure and outlined a three-stage campaign involving the use of accounts at twelve &nbsp;unnamed exchanges as well as personal addresses. The complaint appears to use \"accounts\" to refer to those held on exchanges and \"properties\" for those held in individual addresses.","Officials said that \"working together, IRS, HSI, and FBI agents tracked and seized all 150 cryptocurrency accounts that laundered funds to and from the al-Qassam Brigades' accounts.\"","The ISIS-related campaign focused on the fraudulent sale of PPE, specifically N95 masks alleged to be approved by the FDA.&nbsp;","\"The unsealed forfeiture complaint seized Cakar's website as well as four related Facebook pages used to facilitate the scheme. With this third action, the United States has averted the further victimization of those seeking COVID-19 protective gear, and disrupted the continued funding of ISIS,\" the government's Thursday statement explained.","Â© 2023 The Block.
