Existing backer Icebreaker.vc also invested.","Tesseract did not disclose a valuation.","The lender, which is supervised by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA), is focused on lending out crypto deposits sourced from institutions to sophisticated investors in the crypto space.","Yichen Wu, CEO and co-founder of Tesseract, told The Block that the platform is \u201Cpurely institutional on both sides,\u201D which has helped it to keep a low profile.&nbsp;","\u201CThere\u2019s a lot of exchanges and folks out there that want to offer an interest account for their retail customers, but it\u2019s not what they do \u2013 they\u2019re not credit people,\u201D said Wu. \u201CCrypto credit as a space is extremely underdeveloped. What you see is a lot of folks take other people\u2019s deposits and lend it out to hedge funds and folks on the other side and hoping for the best.\u201D","Wu said Tesseract stands out in the market because it is fully digitized and connected to regulated custodians.
