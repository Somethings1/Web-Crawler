Over the last 24 hours, the price of bonk increased from $0.000014 to a peak of $0.000033, up 135%, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/262643\/bonk-bonk-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's Bonk Price Page<\/a>. The token has gone parabolic recently, up 600% from the start of December to its current price.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The price of bonk has shot up in recent weeks. Image: The Block's Price Page.<\/span><\/em>","Each Solana phone comes with 30 million bonk tokens. While that was only a few dollars when the phone first came out, that amount of tokens was worth $990 at its recent all-time high. That's compared to just $599 for the phone.","That said, it's a risky move. The phones will need to physically arrive for recipients to be able to get their tokens and sell them. If the price of bonk drops further from its current price, this could leave recipients at a loss, excluding the value of the phone.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
