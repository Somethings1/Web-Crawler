US authorities said the action was in connection with reports that North Korean hackers were using the mixer to launder proceeds from several high-profile crypto hacks.","Monday\u2019s sanctions triggered widespread criticisms from several quarters in the crypto space. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163252\/dangerous-precedent-crypto-execs-slam-arrest-of-suspected-tornado-cash-developer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">These criticisms increased<\/a> when Dutch authorities <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163206\/suspected-tornado-cash-developer-arrested-in-amsterdam\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">arrested a Tornado Cash developer<\/a> on Friday.","Tornado Cash has faced de-platforming issues on multiple fronts all week. The mixer\u2019s website, email and GitHub have been taken down. The same happened with Tornado Cash\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163228\/tornado-cashs-discord-server-and-governance-forum-shuttered-amid-arrest?utm_source=cryptopanic&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Discord server and community page<\/a>.","USDC stablecoin issuer Circle also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162172\/circle-freezes-usdc-funds-in-tornado-cashs-us-treasury-sanctioned-wallets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">froze the mixer\u2019s fund<\/a>s in the sanctioned wallets.

This marked the final dress rehearsal for the mainnet merge when Ethereum will transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).","The mainnet merge now has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162988\/ethereum-foundation-suggests-tentative-dates-for-the-merge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a tentative date<\/a>. Ethereum core developers said on Thursday that the event will likely happen in mid-September \u2014 15th or 16th.","Not everyone in the Ethereum ecosystem supports the merge. There are reports of a miner-led hard fork of the blockchain to maintain the PoW status quo.
