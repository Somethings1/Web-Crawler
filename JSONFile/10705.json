Kantorovich and Elkrief are married and Kantorovich joined the Fractal team on April 1.&nbsp;","With Fractal, clients will be able to monitor their positions in real time with counter-parties to reduce counterparty risk. In theory, that means that a counter-party can't trade using the same collateral with multiple counter-parties.","Collateral for borrowing will be limited to crypto blue-chip coins to avoid the wrong-sided liquidity issues that counter-parties face with Alameda, which borrowed against their holdings in their native token FTT.&nbsp;","\"A trade with counterparty A and counterparty B doesn't necessarily affect the rest of their counterparties because they all have segregated accounts and you have to post collateral with each account,\" Kantorovich said. \"If someone deposits $10 million with a counter-party and that shows up in a dashboard, you can see it is not being rehypothecated.\"","Fractal's not alone in its mission. Longtime crypto markets executive Michael Moro joined an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/224765\/former-genesis-ceo-cryptocurency-derivatives-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">upstart derivatives exchange<\/a> called Ankex as CEO after stepping down from beleaguered lending and trading firm Genesis Global Capital.","\"Having come from Genesis and seen the events of 2022 unfold, I\u2019m acutely aware of the importance of empowering traders to operate on trustless platforms while retaining full control of their assets at all times,\" Moro said at the time.","To be sure, institutional traders also crave under-collateralized loans because they are more capital efficient.&nbsp;","\u201CIt is challenging to cross collateralize on-chain yield bearing assets, OTC bilateral agreements in a cost efficient way. Fractal solves this by putting it on-chain, which is transparent, and efficient for both sides of the transaction. QCP Capital is pleased to support such a solution that improves capital efficiency and catalyzes the progression of DeFi,\u201D said Stan Low, head of investments, QCP Capital.","QCP invested alongside 6th Man Ventures, Archetype. Blizzard and CMT Digital.
