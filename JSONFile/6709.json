As Tayi notes:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere actually ends up being a myriad of different candidate medicines with promise that are sitting on shelves today, but simply lack the capital and the focus to be able to develop them.\u201D<\/span>","This is the problem Tayi hopes to address through Vibe Bio. By using a DAO structure, Vibe Bio is able to put forward governance proposals to identify promising treatment options. $VIBE token holders can then vote on which treatments will get funded via the proceeds of the DAO's token sale.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As Tayi explains, this decentralized approach empowers patients who would otherwise be unable to get assistance from centralized biotech companies:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhen you start to move away from a traditional sort of financing model to one that's community led, patients can now be in the driver's seat of deciding what medicines to pursue, what disease areas we should try to treat, not profit or politics.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Earlier this week, Vibe <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20220622005287\/en\/Vibe-Bio-Launches-To-Transform-Drug-Development-For-Patients-With-Rare-Diseases\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> it received $12 million in a funding round led by Initialized Capital, which also included participation from prominent angel investors Naval Ravikant and Balaji Srinivasan, as well as 6th Man Ventures \u2014 the venture firm helmed by The Block Co-Founder Mike Dudas \u2014 amongst others.<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro and Tayi also discuss:<\/span><\/i>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fireblocks.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/coinbase.com\/prime\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase Prime<\/a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/crossriver.com\/crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cross River<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.
