The stablecoin will be overcollateralized, meaning that it is backed by excess collateral in the form of cryptocurrency held in a reserve. This is a similar design used by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/85850\/dai-compound-dydx-liquidations-defi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dai<\/a>, the most popular decentralized stablecoin in the Ethereum ecosystem.
