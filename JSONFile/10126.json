The expanded product builds on Casa\u2019s core multi-key vault technology, allowing its members to grant secure, conditional vault access to a recipient of their choice from $250 per year. That could be a loved one, trustee or estate executor.&nbsp;","Casa\u2019s multi-key vaults provide enhanced security by enabling an easy way for users to hold crypto assets in their own digital vault with up to five keys. The vaults offer more distributed security compared to single-key hardware wallets, browser extensions or third-party custodians like crypto exchanges and were expanded to offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235789\/casa-ether-vault-bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">self-custody of ether<\/a> and stablecoins in addition to bitcoin last year.","Despite <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241945\/jameson-lopp-casa-bitcoin-lightning-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">criticism<\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> from <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -0.36%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> maximalists, Casa made the move in response to clients. \u201CIn recent years, it has become technically sound to implement <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248349\/ethereum-eth-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ethereum.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">ETH<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -0.84%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> support, which has dovetailed with market demand,\u201D the company said at the time.<\/span>","By requiring signatures from multiple devices for transactions, a system known as a multisig, Casa helps keep funds protected even if a key is lost or compromised, reducing concerns over theft, loss or exchange mismanagement. The devices can be spread out for safekeeping, including an emergency recovery service \u2014 where Casa holds a backup key on a user's behalf.","To set up the self-custodial inheritance feature, members grant conditional vault access and share locked, encrypted keys with a designated recipient within the Casa app. If that member becomes incapacitated, the recipient can then request a transfer, subject to a six-month waiting period, during which Casa notifies the member of the pending transfer. Only when that period has elapsed is the vault access unlocked for the recipient.","Commenting on the recently launched U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the Casa team said that while Bitcoin ETFs are useful to gain exposure in retirement accounts or other regulated vehicles, they \u201Cmiss bitcoin\u2019s largest value proposition as truly ownable digital money \u2014 which can only be realized through self-custody.\u201D&nbsp;","Casa also argued that spot Bitcoin ETFs suffer from significant centralization risk, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/279434\/kraken-challenging-coinbases-reign-as-chief-custodian-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">majority<\/a> of products entrusting custody of bitcoin to a single custodian: Coinbase.","\u201CA surprising second-order effect of the new ETFs is just how much they\u2019re motivating sophisticated investors to choose self-custody for their generational wealth,\u201D Casa co-founder and CEO Nick Neuman claimed. \u201CIf you view bitcoin as a long-term hedge against the financial system, holding it inside that system is a non-starter.\u201D","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
