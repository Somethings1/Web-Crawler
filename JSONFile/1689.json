This allocation means that Khosla continues to receive newly vested tokens into his assigned address over this period.","Evmos is a Cosmos-backed blockchain that supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). While <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Evmos is based on the Cosmos software stack, it is also compatible with Ethereum apps. Last year, the team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/182223\/evmos-developers-raise-27-million-in-a-token-sale-led-by-polychain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $27 million<\/a> in a token fundraising round led by Polychain Capital. <\/span>Its development is currently led by the other co-founder Federico Kunze Küllmer.","Khosla has sold 144,000 tokens so far, valued at $40,000 at the time of sale, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/web3_analyst\/status\/1659669231263178755\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to<\/a> on-chain findings from Jessica Huhnke, a web3 data analyst and engineer at Flipside Crypto. This accounts for a mere 1.5% of the total Evmos sold since April 30. In contrast, other users have sold a combined total of around 9 million tokens, Huhnke found.","Nevertheless, Khosla\u2019s sell-offs coincided with a sharp decrease in Evmos\u2019 token price. Its value has nosedived by more than 50% this May, falling from $0.30 at the beginning of the month to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/evmos\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">now $0.14<\/a>.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Evmos Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko<\/span>","Khosla left the project due to \u201Coperational misalignment and disagreements over accountability,\u201D the Evmos team <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EvmosOrg\/status\/1659635169299673089\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a>. They claim to be actively working with Khosla to transfer the tokens back to the Evmos Foundation rather than seeing them sold on decentralized exchanges. Evmos also shared Khosla\u2019s GitHub contributions to the project.","Khosla's wallet remains the largest delegator on the Evmos' network and has staked 11.5 million ($1.6 million) tokens, the Evmos team said. When contacted, Khosla said he was \u201Coutraged\u201D about the assertions from the Evmos team.","\u201CI\u2019m deeply disappointed and outraged at the misleading assertions that have wrongly portrayed me as being anything but loyal to the Evmos project and community. I\u2019ve dedicated the last two years of my life to Evmos, and I would never do anything to jeopardize the integrity of the project and the community\u2019s trust,\" Khosla stated in a comment shared with The Block. \"While I explore all available options that would yield the best possible outcome for the Evmos community, I look forward to sharing more soon.\u201D&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This story has been updated with a comment from Akash Khosla.<\/em>","© 2023 The Block.
