In the case of a business model for a solar or wind farm, earning revenue from renewable energy certificates can lead to a divergence from underlying demand for that electricity.\u201D","\u201CThis results in situations where wind and solar projects are built in remote, low-cost locations with ample sun or wind, generating renewable energy certificates that can be monetized, but with no immediate local demand, leading to idle assets,\u201D Roberts added.","\u201CBitcoin mining is well-suited to address these issues and provide a valuable service to the grid. It can quickly adapt to price changes, making it a responsive solution for grid management, relative to more traditional industries,\u201D he continued. \u201CIn more simple terms, we can take energy from the grid when it\u2019s advantageous to all parties involved, or turn off our Bitcoin mining and re-supply power to the grid when it\u2019s in need.\u201D","Iris Energy previously reported receiving <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/249904\/iris-energy-bitcoin-mining\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$2.3 million power credits<\/a> in August, primarily driven by voluntary curtailment at its Childress site in Texas during peak demand.","Using 100% renewable energy is core to Iris Energy\u2019s business. Beyond that, Roberts said it was committed to only entering markets where Iris Energy\u2019s energy consumption is helping to solve problems in that energy market.","Being able to shed load to balance energy grids has been very challenging for traditional industries, but Bitcoin mining is a powerful tool to solve the problem, Roberts argued.","\u201CWhen you're dealing with Bitcoin mining, which is a fully digital operation \u2014 we are able to automatically put our miners to sleep in a matter of seconds,\u201D he said. \u201CThis is a game changer in terms of being able to provide a demand response capability to the grids \u2014 and this is exactly what we are doing today in Texas.\u201D","Roberts also highlighted the company's focus on building institutional-grade data centers, optimized, not just for Bitcoin mining, but for high power-density applications like generative AI.","The purpose-built facilities provide superior operational efficiency compared to traditional data centers, are designed to withstand extreme temperature variations and are better equipped to meet the power requirements of modern AI workloads, Roberts claimed.","\u201CFor example, a traditional data center historically works with 5-15kW rack density, compared to around 40kW per rack for GPU workloads. Our Bitcoin mining operations are running at approximately 70kW per rack,\u201D Roberts continued.","\u201CWhat we are seeing is traditional data centers encountering the challenge of having to triple their power density and adapt their electrical infrastructure, airflow and cooling solutions \u2014 which is a real challenge that will take time to solve,\u201D he added.","In response to the growing energy demands of Bitcoin mining \u2014 often <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenpeace.org\/usa\/reports\/investing-in-bitcoins-climate-pollution\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">criticized<\/a> by groups like Greenpeace \u2014 and emerging technologies like AI, Iris Energy implemented several strategies to boost energy efficiency, according to Roberts. This includes using advanced cooling systems and acquiring the latest generation of energy-efficient Bitmain S21 Bitcoin miners, combined with locating near renewable energy sources to provide a sustainable and responsible means to mine Bitcoin and power AI, he said.","Reflecting on market dynamics compared to a year ago, just as the FTX debacle began to unfold, Roberts said the market feels like it\u2019s in a much better place.&nbsp;","\u201CThe Bitcoin price around the time of the FTX collapse was hovering around $15,000. Bitcoin is trading around $35,000 today, a Bitcoin ETF is likely round the corner and we have the halving event coming up in 2024. Things have certainly improved materially over the last 12 months,\u201D he said.","Iris Energy's expansion plans, including continued investment in the growth of its core Bitcoin mining business and the provision of services to generative AI customers, reflect the team\u2019s optimism about the market's future, he added.","Discussing the evolving landscape of Bitcoin mining, Robert said he had witnessed a shift from chip manufacturing dominance to building large-scale infrastructure and accessing institutional capital.","\u201CIf we go back in time, competitive advantage in mining was dominated by the manufacturers of chips,\u201D he said. However, as the industry continued to grow, it necessitated a \u201Csignificant increase in the scale of real-world infrastructure and energy required to support the industry.\u201D","\u201CWe have seen large amounts of capital being invested into Bitcoin mining, particularly from public market investors, which has fueled expansion in the global hashrate,\u201D Robert continued. \u201CThe shift in competitive advantage moved away from chip quality and towards who could build large-scale, real-world infrastructure businesses and access institutional capital markets for scaling \u2014 all of which are core competencies of the Iris Energy team.\u201D"],"hashtag":["BITCOIN","MINING COMPANIES"]}
