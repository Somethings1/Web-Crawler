Last year, Decentralized Pictures, co-founded by legendary director Francis Ford Coppola's son Roman Coppola, helped fund the film \"The Quiet Maid,\" which secured much of its financing from the sale of NFTs.","\u201CThe 'New Here' universe introduces an exciting new digital realm that connects entertainment with digital ownership in a way the media and film industry has yet to venture into,\" Arbitrum Foundation's head of ecosystem development, Nina Rong said in a statement. \"Owning an NFT corresponding to a short series to unlock advancing viewing experiences has the potential to reimagine how media companies approach media&nbsp; releases in a web3 world.\u201D&nbsp;","\"New Here\" is a feature film that is comprised of 11 short films that will be released throughout this year, according to the statement. An NFT collection called Glimpses can be claimed on Zora, a platform artists and brands can use to mint non-fungible tokens. \"Glimpses are open-edition art pieces that will connect audiences to an interactive experience while viewing the 'New Here,'\" short film series, the statement also said.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
