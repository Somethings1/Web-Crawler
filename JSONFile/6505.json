A lot of S19J Pros are not profitable,\" said William Foxley, Compass Mining's media and strategy director.","While more and more ASIC machines flood the market, average prices have crashed generally about 80% compared to last December, according to data from Luxor.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-asic-price-index\/embed\" title=\"Bitcoin ASIC Price Index\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Difficulty refers to the complexity of the computational process behind mining and it adjusts roughly every two weeks (or every 2,016 blocks) in sync with the network's hash rate. The network's hashrate has fallen over 7% since Nov. 20, the date of the last update.","A drop in difficulty of this size could give miners some breathing room.","\"This will benefit the miners that can weather the hashprice environment with low-cost operations and high-efficiency machines,\" Vera said.","It would contrast sharply with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175900\/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-jumps-to-all-time-high-levels\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">13.55% jump<\/a> in difficulty observed early in October.

The largest drop this year so far has been 5.01% in July.","\"The first half of Q4 saw a consistent supply of new generation machines being plugged into open rack space, which will come at the expense of older-generation and higher-cost operators,\" said Vera.","Â© 2023 The Block.
