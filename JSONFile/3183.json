The tokenized bonds are held on a distributed ledger, enabling almost instantaneous exchange via atomic settlement. Traditionally, it takes around 48 hours to settle bond trades. However, atomic settlement uses innovations from the blockchain sector, such as smart contracts for automated clearing and settlement and digital signatures in the form of public or private keys.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Citigroup became the custodian for BondbloX's underlying traditionally issued bonds in 2021.

According to the press release, Citigroup's custody of the full financial vertical opens up these products to a wider base of institutional investors. The enhanced partnership with Citi also gives BondbloX users greater access to the global bond market, enabling them to have a more diverse digital asset portfolio.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"This partnership will enable Citi\u2019s clients and others to enjoy the full benefits of bond trading, coupled with Citi\u2019s securities services support, almost immediately.
