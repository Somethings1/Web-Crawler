Besides tumbling crypto markets, SonicWall researchers tied other factors to the drop in ransomware events, including security standards at companies and an increase in law-enforcement efforts.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere are too many variables in the first half of 2022 to make a direct correlation. However, over the years ebbs and flows of popular cryptocurrency like bitcoin have often served as an early indicator of shifts in overall ransomware volume,\u201D the spokesperson said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Per SonicWall researchers, ransomware incidents peaked in 2021 with a record-breaking number of events. During the year, there were some high-profile attacks targeting organizations like<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/jbs-paid-11-million-to-resolve-ransomware-attack-11623280781\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JBS Foods<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/107496\/us-official-says-majority-of-bitcoin-paid-by-colonial-pipeline-after-ransomware-attack-has-been-recovered\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Colonial Pipeline<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, both of which paid millions of dollars worth of bitcoin to hackers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As ransomware attacks started to make more news headlines, it prompted governmental efforts to control the issue.
