The exchange noted it is a \"method that verifies the accuracy and authenticity of OKX's PoR while upholding user privacy \u2014 no account balances are visible to other parties.\"","As detailed in the exchange's most recent PoR report, the combined value of bitcoin, ether and tether reserves has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.okx.com\/learn\/okx-introduces-zk-stark-technology-to-proof-of-reserves-monthly-snapshot\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">risen<\/a> to $10.7 billion, an increase from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.okx.com\/learn\/okx-publishes-fifth-monthly-proof-of-reserves\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$8.9 billion<\/a> reported in March.

This method was not deemed ideal for user privacy, prompting the decision to incorporate zero-knowledge proofs. In February, Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210137\/binance-deploys-zk-snarks-on-proof-of-reserves-system\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">added<\/a> zero-knowledge proofs to its PoR system in an effort to enhance privacy.","Over the past six months, centralized exchanges have placed greater emphasis on proof of reserves, addressing users' concerns regarding the security of their funds in the aftermath of FTX's bankruptcy due to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/225601\/ftx-bankruptcy-report-latest\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bank run<\/a> and subsequent bankruptcy protection filing in November 2022.","This incident exposed that the exchange had failed to maintain a 1:1 backing for its customer assets, leading to major industry crisis that subsequently prompted most other exchanges to adopt increased transparency surrounding their reserves.","Â© 2023 The Block.
