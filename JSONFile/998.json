Lightning Labs\u2019 goal is to change that, she said, by \u201Cbringing bitcoin to billions.\u201D","Stark added that numerous big hitters, including some that haven\u2019t yet announced plans involving stablecoins, are exploring using Taro to issue stablecoins on Lightning.","The Taro protocol wouldn\u2019t have been possible without taproot, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/124276\/bitcoin-taproot-activated\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an upgrade<\/a> to Bitcoin\u2019s code implemented in November last year that aimed to improve the privacy and security of transactions.","In tandem to announcing the launch of Taro, Lightning Labs said it had raised $70 million in an equity-based Series B funding round, led by Valor Equity Partners and Baillie Gifford, the asset manager. Goldcrest Capital, Kingsway, Moore Strategic Ventures, Brevan Howard, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, NYDIG, and Silvergate CEO Alan Lane also participated.<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/strong>","Both Brevan Howard and NYDIG \u2014 which helps institutions expand into crypto with a range of custody and trading tools \u2014 are doubling down on the Lightning Network. In October last year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/122564\/nydig-acquires-british-crypto-startup-bottlepay-300-million-stock-purchase\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NYDIG acquired Bottlepay<\/a>, a Lightning Network payments firm, for $300 million. Former Brevan Howard CEO Alan Howard has previously invested in the startup.","Lightning Labs did not disclose a valuation for its latest raise. It also refrained from doing so when it secured the backing of former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey and others in a $2.5 million seed round in 2018, and when it raised $10 million in February 2020.","Indeed, Stark mocked the focus placed on private market valuations in the wider crypto market, arguing that products are more important than price tags. \u201CMoney is a means, it\u2019s not an end,\u201D she said.","Launched in 2016 and with a staff of less than 30 people, Lightning Labs is the primary developer of the Lightning Network. A majority of the more than 30,000 nodes on the network rely on its infrastructure, according to its announcement. More than 300 companies are building tools using software developed by the startup.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: This piece was updated at 8:50pm ET to clarify the fact that Peter Thiel is not involved in Valor Equity Partners, as stated in an earlier version.&nbsp;<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
