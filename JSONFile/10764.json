Enabling users to transact directly without immediate settlement on the main blockchain, Lightning offers a solution to the slower transaction speeds and higher fees associated with Bitcoin's mainnet. Users can open payment channels between themselves, allowing for off-chain transactions later settled on the Bitcoin blockchain.","David Marcus, CEO of enterprise-grade Lightning Network firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/225538\/bitcoins-lightning-network-paypal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lightspark<\/a>, highlighted the importance of building out the infrastructure and capacity of the network. \u201CParticularly because we can actually guarantee that even larger payments succeed on Lightning, which in the past has been pretty hard to achieve,\u201D Marcus told The Block during the latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236600\/bitcoin-lightning-lightspark?utm_source=onecryptofeed&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">episode<\/a> of The Scoop podcast.","\u201CIt's really building the capabilities that will enable any enterprise out there to access a real time, super low cost settlement network for the internet that's interoperable, that's open that any developer can build on. I think that you're going to see more adoption,\u201D added the former PayPal president and head of Meta\u2019s abandoned Diem stablecoin project. \u201CYou need more exchanges to be on the network so they can actually move not only bitcoin but be good on and off ramps for the Lightning Network.\u201D","\"There's just more happening. I think there's more happening on Bitcoin in terms of development energy in the last 12 months than in the last X number of years combined. It's really pretty amazing to see,\" Marcus said.","The Lightning Network\u2019s growth coincides with a recent price rise and increased adoption from crypto exchanges.
