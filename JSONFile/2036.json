He said even if gas prices improve and onboarding costs reduce, it \"would still be a deal breaker for many mainstream applications with millions of users.\"","UniLogin considered pivoting to a Layer-2 DeFi focused wallet or a sign-in solution only for a smaller set of products in xDAI, but that would have been almost a restart of the project. So UniLogin decided simply to return the remaining cash to investors, said Van de Sande.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe firm is yet to figure out how much money is to be returned to investors after accounting costs, Van de Sande told The Block. UniLogin raised less than a quarter-million in seed funding, mainly from Swiss angel investor Paolo Rebuffo, said Van de Sande.","UniLogin will continue running relayers until the end of the year to facilitate users migrating their interfaces and funds elsewhere.","Van de Sande is yet to announce his next move. His co-founder Marek Kirejczyk and the rest of the UniLogin team are joining Ethworks \u2014 a place where startups can hire a team for their Ethereum projects.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This story has been updated to include comments from UniLogin co-founder Alex Van de Sande.<\/em><\/span>"],"hashtag":["ETHEREUM"]}
