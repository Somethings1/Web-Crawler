An $81.7 million exploit of cross-chain bridge protocol <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/269809\/orbit-chains-bridge-reportedly-hacked-for-81-5-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Orbit Bridge<\/a>, as New Year\u2019s celebrations were underway, represented the largest attack. January witnessed the highest monthly losses in Q1 overall at $133 million.","Book-ending the quarter, the recent $62 million exploit of Blast-based NFT game <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284883\/web3-gaming-platform-munchables-loses-62-5-million-in-exploit-zachxbt\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Munchables<\/a> was the second-largest attack.

The number of attacks also dropped 17.6% from 74 in Q1 2023 to 61 in Q1 this year.","However, the $336.3 million in losses represents a 23.1% decrease compared to losses of $437.5 million in the same quarter last year.&nbsp;","\u201CWhile it's positive that overall losses have decreased, it's essential to note that DeFi faced significant challenges, accounting for 100% of total losses in Q1 2024,\u201D Immunefi founder and CEO Mitchell Amador said. \u201CParticularly, the ecosystem witnessed a considerable volume of losses due to private key compromises, emphasizing the critical need to secure both code and protocol infrastructure.\u201D","Hacks dominated the losses in Q1, accounting for 95.6% ($321.6 million) of the total across 46 incidents, compared to cases of fraud, scams and rug pulls at 4.4% ($14.7 million) over 15 incidents.","Ethereum surpassed BNB Chain to become the most targeted chain again in Q1, with the two networks suffering the majority of the total losses at a combined 73%.&nbsp;","Ethereum witnessed the most individual attacks, with 33 incidents \u2014 representing 51% of the losses. BNB Chain witnessed 12 attacks, representing 22% of exploited funds.
