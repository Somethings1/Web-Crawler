Michael McCarthy, who is listed by some publications as Gala\u2019s third co-founder, is not mentioned in either lawsuit. The company recently launched Champions Arena, a turn-based RPG game for mobile devices, and also has ventures in blockchain-based music, film, and digital collectibles.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In his lawsuit, Schiermeyer alleges that Thurston \u201C\u200B\u200Bhas founded numerous companies, most of which have ended up in litigation, insolvent, bankrupt, and\/or sued by the SEC,\u201D and claims Gala Games is the only legitimate enterprise in which Thurston has an interest.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Schiermeyer\u2019s main allegation is that Thurston stole 8.6 billion GALA tokens in February 2021, more than 100% of the total amount of GALA in circulation at the time as reported by market aggregators. Schiermeyer claims Thurston effectively held the company hostage, as exposing the token theft would cause him to liquidate his holdings, collapsing the GALA ecosystem as a result.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As a partial solution, in May 2023, the company issued Gala v2 tokens that were <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.gala.games\/introducing-gala-v2-a-new-era-for-the-gala-games-ecosystem-e1ca2e09608b\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">advertised<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> as bringing \u201Ca host of improvements to the table, including enhanced burn mechanisms, security enhancements, and future upgradeability.\u201D Only Schiermeyer claims the real purpose of the tokens was to make the GALA tokens in Thurston-controlled wallets obsolete while leaving the rest of the ecosystem unaffected.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By the time of the upgrade, the lawsuit claims approximately half of Thurston\u2019s GALA tokens ended up at centralized exchanges, where Thurston sold them for over $130 million in profit. When Schiermeyer demanded that Thurston stop selling the stolen GALA, the lawsuit claims, \u201CThurston first responded that he was selling some of the GALA tokens in order to purchase ammunition for firearms. Then he stopped responding.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The lawsuit names several companies that Schiermeyer alleges were multi-level marketing schemes and quotes a former associate of Thurston who claims his actions \u201Cruined the lives of thousand[s] of young people as well as seasoned investors.\u201D The filing also includes a separate lawsuit filed by the crypto company Blox against Thurston for alleged damages of $200 million related to equipment Thurston promised to provide the company and never delivered. That lawsuit also alleges Thurston engaged in Paycheck Protection Program fraud through his entity Block Brothers.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Schiermeyer also alleges that Thurston has been largely absent from the operations of Gala, even being \u201Cvirtually unreachable for many months at a time,\u201D according to his complaint.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thurston, in his lawsuit, agrees that he hasn\u2019t been running the company, but complains that Schiermeyer \u201Ccaused [Gala] to operate without notice to or input from [Thurston], thus eliminating Thurston\u2019s ability to help guide [Gala] to the benefit of the company and its shareholders.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thurston\u2019s lawsuit claims \u201CSchiermeyer\u2019s malfeasance, mismanagement, and self-dealing have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to [Gala]\u2019s reputation and company and shareholder assets.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gala Games did not immediately reply to The Block\u2019s request for comment .&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thurston was also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/litigation\/litreleases\/lr-25659\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sued by the SEC<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> earlier this year in relation to a different company he founded, Green United LLC, which the SEC alleges misled investors into putting $18 million into a fraudulent green crypto enterprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to the SEC, investors in Green United were told by the company and by a promoter also named in the suit, Kristoffer A.
