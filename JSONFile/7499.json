However, these concerns have seemingly eased with Lido's decreasing market share.","The analysts pointed out that network decentralization plays a role in determining the classification of a digital token as a security, as highlighted by the release of the \"Hinman documents\" by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last June. At the time, SEC officials noted that tokens operating on a \"sufficiently decentralized\" network might not meet the criteria to be deemed securities, primarily due to the lack of a controlling entity in the Howey sense.","Following the release of the Hinman documents last year, JPMorgan analysts had said U.S. lawmakers could create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235092\/jpmorgan-ethereum-eth-other-category\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a new \"other category\"<\/a> to accommodate Ethereum, thus avoiding its classification as a security while ensuring investor protection. SEC chairman Gary Gensler has refused to comment on whether Ethereum is exempt from securities regulations.","Ethereum's recent Dencun upgrade has significantly reduced transaction costs for Ethereum Layer 2 networks, increasing their transaction count and total value locked. This development positions Ethereum as an \"ultimate settlement layer for the Ethereum ecosystem,\" according to the JPMorgan analysts.","\"Effectively via using Ethereum Layer 2 and emerging Layer 3 solutions, developers could now settle transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem instead of switching towards other alternative Layer 1 chains to deploy their applications,\" the analysts noted.","Following Dencun, the analysts said the next major upgrade on Ethereum's roadmap is Pectra, which is slated to go live later this year. Pectra will add Verkle trees to save space and speed up block verification by clearing out old blocks, which will further benefit Ethereum, according to the analysts.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
