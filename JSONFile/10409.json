It started building out GSR Capital last year, hiring research and operations staff and is now offering two funds, one focused on bitcoin exposure and the other on the broader market.","They\u2019ve already seen \u201Cremarkably high interest\u201D from family offices and institutional investors who want exposure to digital assets, according to GSR CEO Jakob Palmstierna.","\u201COne of the best ways of getting exposure to a new asset class is via allocating to an investment manager, so we looked around us, saying, \u2018Are there any really credible investment alternatives in crypto?\u2019 And we find that the answer was pretty weak,\u201D Palmstierna said. \u201CWhat we want to create is something that looks and feels like any other line item on an allocated portfolio except that the underlying exposure is to this new asset class.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nGSR Capital is aiming to provide familiarity and credibility to traditional investors interested but cautious about moving into a new asset class. And that asset class has taken a beating this year, with prices plunging, coins like luna collapsing and high-profile bankruptcies like Three Arrows Capital dominating the headlines.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nStill, Palmstierna remains confident. Even if you know nothing about crypto, he said, the potential is more than evident. He cited the opportunities inherent in blockchain technology, the deep talent pool in the industry and more than $36 billion in venture capital invested last year.","\u201CYou have promising technology with the greatest talent density with a huge amount of capital behind it,\u201D Palmstierna said. \u201CDo you want to invest one or two percent into that promising technology? It\u2019s almost a no-brainer.\u201D","While the digital assets can be esoteric and mysterious, GSR is counting on its long-term involvement in the crypto space and the creation of an experience that feels familiar to more traditional investors. The aim is to \u201Cmake the experience as comfortable as possible, especially for institutions moving into what\u2019s a new space for them and obviously that brings a lot of challenges for them both from an investment analysis perspective, but also from a governance, due diligence perspective,\u201D Chief Operating Officer Andrew Moss said.","The funds have a lot in common with traditional investment vehicles, but there are crypto-specific facets to take into account, such as the 24\/7 nature of trading and implementing research framework on day one that can account for that, Moss said.","Palmstierna said two more funds are likely to be launched this year as the company ramps up.","\u201CInvestors are desperately looking for new sources of potential returns,\u201D Palmstierna said. \u201CWe think we\u2019re creating something that doesn\u2019t exist today which will help investors actually coming into the space.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Editor's note: GSR provided new information regarding its two funds, clarifying a previous version of this story.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
