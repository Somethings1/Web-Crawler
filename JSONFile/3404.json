METACO provides crypto custody, trading, and tokenization solutions for financial institutions.","METACO said it is also looking to serve central banks for their digital currency initiatives. Its investors Giesecke+Devrient and SICPA already provide security solutions to central banks.","\"The tokenization narrative is gaining momentum among regulators and central banks, encompassing a broad spectrum of promising innovations ranging from digital currencies to national identities,\" said Assaf Shamia, investment director at Giesecke+Devrient. \"Yet tokenized assets require a trusted, secure and scalable solution to handle the safeguarding of private keys. Following extensive market research we identified METACO as the dominant player in its field.\"","Founded in 2015, METACO has previously raised funding twice, and today's Series A brings the firm's total funding to date to $21 million, a METACO spokesperson told The Block.&nbsp;","Switzerland-based crypto firms have been attracting investments at an increasing pace.
