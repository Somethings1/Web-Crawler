The BlockFi settlement remains subject to approval.","There were 154 claims filed against the 3AC estate, with a total value of $3.4 billion, the report notes. It states that $200 million of the claims were not admitted for distribution, while $322 million of claims have either been rejected or are expected to be rejected. Claims worth $76 million are being disputed.","The large majority of the assets held by the liquidators are illiquid tokens subject to vesting periods, according to a breakdown of the assets. Only 6% of the portfolio is liquid.","Illiquid tokens make up 82% of assets, while equity and investments come to 6.9%, and 4.8% is in cash.","The illiquid tokens comprise 13 different tokens and have a combined value of $563 million at current prices. They are subject to vesting schedules with roughly $50 million of assets to be unlocked in most quarters until the end of 2026. By the end of 2024, $200 million of tokens will have been unlocked.","The liquidators have staked a number of these tokens, they said \u2014 which has already resulted in $5.4 million of staking rewards. The cash holdings have also generated $1 million in interest payments.","The liquidators have been generally converting liquid tokens and NFTs to fiat. So far, $34.5 million worth of liquid tokens have been sold, in addition to $15 million worth of NFTs. When combined with other asset sales, the liquidators have realized $66 million.","As Teneo stated earlier today, A British Virgin Islands court <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268758\/bvi-court-freezes-three-arrows-capital-founders-1-billion-in-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has frozen up<\/a> to $1.1 billion worth of assets belonging to 3AC co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, as well as Davies\u2019 wife Kelly Chen.","The liquidators\u2019 report adds further detail. It says liquidators have filed a claim for insolvent trading against the 3AC founders for $1.078 billion. It further filed claims against Davies for $66 million and Chen for $4.6 million.","After <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255133\/photos-show-the-moment-3ac-co-founder-su-zhu-was-arrested-in-singapore\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Zhu was arrested in Singapore<\/a> on Sept. 29, he was sentenced to four months imprisonment, the report notes.
