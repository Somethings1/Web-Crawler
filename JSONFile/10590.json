","\"It appears the liquidity generated from the surge in large-cap tokens in 2023 is now flowing into fringe markets with explosive impact,\" Grant added.","Livepeer, the native token of a decentralized video streaming platform, saw its price rise 33.9% in the past week, before dropping 3% in the past day to $5.35.
