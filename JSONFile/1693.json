The investment supposedly brought the project\u2019s valuation to more than $100 million. But Temasek <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Temasek\/status\/1653246130124394496?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">took to Twitter<\/a> today to deny those reports.","\u201CWe have seen news articles and a tweet from Array about Temasek\u2019s investment in it.
