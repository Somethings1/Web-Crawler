Tompros previously represented the creator of \u201CPepe the Frog\u201D Matt Furie in efforts to reclaim the character from alt-right figures and groups, and won a case against Infowars' Alex Jones for his use of the character in 2019.","He will be working alongside co-counsel Alfred Steinder of Meister &amp; Steiner PLLC, an expert on NFTs and intellectual property law.","Ripps began drawing links between the BAYC collection and what he called \u201Csubversive internet nazi troll culture\u201D late last year. In mid-May he launched his RR\/BAYC collection that copies the designs of the original BAYC NFTs. His claims \u2013 that the use of certain images and numbers in the BAYC collection are subtle nods to nazism \u2013 were echoed in an-hour long \u201Cdocumentary\u201D by YouTuber Philion, who also called for Ape holders to destroy their NFTs.","While Yuga had until that point remained silent on the theories, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/154094\/bored-ape-founders-push-back-on-nazi-accusations-open-up-about-logo-inspiration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pushed back<\/a> following the release of the video. In a medium post, Yuga Labs branded the claims \u201Cbullshit.\u201D","Ripps sees the court case as an attack on art and free speech. To him, the RR\/BAYC collection is protest art. To Yuga Labs, it is copyright infringement and part of an unwarranted attack on the brand.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
