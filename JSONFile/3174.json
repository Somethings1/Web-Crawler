Bitcoin\u2019s slow adoption of new features is often misunderstood as Bitcoin development itself being stalled, when actually it's <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@ElectricCapital\/dev-report-476df4ff1fd2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">very active<\/a>, but just unusually conservative in service of keeping Bitcoin chain security as high as possible.","In this BIP draft, Jeremy proposes a constrained and minimal type of covenant be added to Bitcoin. <a href=\"https:\/\/fc16.ifca.ai\/bitcoin\/papers\/MES16.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Covenants<\/a> are essentially a type of restriction on where a given set of coins can be spent. They\u2019re a very useful smart-contract primitive, which would enable things like \u201Cvaults\u201D which could protect your Bitcoin from being easily spent by someone who got your private key (details in the linked paper), but have the downside of potentially enabling someone to mint BTC that can only ever be spent to specific addresses. There was some worry that this might enable e.g. a nation state to demand that all BTC held by its citizens enter into covenants that only allowed it to be spent among pre-approved addresses, for example.","Jeremy\u2019s version of covenants are wrapped with a multisig-based key which can pre-empt\/nullify the covenant. Further, they don\u2019t allow arbitrary ouputs to be added\u2014all outputs must be specified at construction, which means these covenants can only be used to expand to a finite number of steps, which alleviates a lot of the fungibility worries. Finally, in this proposal, \u201Ccovenants are restricted to be spendable as a single input only, preventing the 'half spend' problem.\u201D","These limited covenants get us some pretty neat things, though. First, you can use them to essentially commit a bunch of future payments in a single transaction during a time when fees are especially high, and then expand the payments (confirming them on chain) either in one or multiple tiered steps, when fees are lower. Similarly you can use them to instantiate a bunch of channels instead of payments, which allows instant liquidity for the coins involved. These covenants can also be used to create a construction very similar to the \u201Cvaults\u201D in the initial covenants paper, and also have some benefits for implementing trustless CoinJoin, a privacy preserving aggregation technique.","Whether or not Jeremy\u2019s BIP will make it into Bitcoin is unclear at this point\u2014the proposal is very new and will definitely receive a lot of feedback and tweaks. However, it\u2019s a great example of how you can add interesting features to Bitcoin while avoiding compromise of BTC\u2019s core value proposition\u2014a trustless store of value with high on-chain security. I\u2019ll track this BIP as it makes its way through the approval process and provide commentary in future newsletters.","In another interesting development, Veil (a prediction market interface initially built to execute onto Augur) has forked the Augur codebase and removed the decentralized oracle part (enabling market creators to choose an oracle, including the Augur oracle itself, or a centralized one instead) and thereby have also removed REP. This (ETH projects forking out somewhat unnecessary ERC20 tokens) is something I expected to see sooner, and I\u2019m very curious to watch it develop with Veil. A skeptic would say that this move is likely to end up with a lot of people using centralized oracles, essentially obviating the need for a blockchain at all\u2014an optimist would say that other decentralized oracles without tokens will become available, and there will be increased liquidity as a result of removing the REP requirement. Watch this space!","Thanks as always for reading\u2014more next week!","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jimmy and <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinops.org\/en\/newsletters\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Optech<\/a>&nbsp;on Bitcoin<\/strong>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tony from Kadena<\/strong>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kadena is building Pact, a formally verifiable smart-contracting language for financial applications, and Chainweb, a PoW blockchain that uses multiple chains in parallel to increase throughput.<\/em>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aviv from Spacemesh<\/strong>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Spacemesh is a programmable cryptocurrency powered by a novel proof-of-space-time consensus protocol.<\/em>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JZ from Decred<\/strong>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Decred&nbsp;is an autonomous digital currency with a hybrid consensus system.
