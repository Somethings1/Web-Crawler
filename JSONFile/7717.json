Further, Giri is accused of commingling customer funds with his own funds and bank accounts belonging to his parents, Giri Subramani and Loka Pavani Giri.","\u201CRather than using customer funds to acquire and trade digital assets as promised, Giri simply pocketed customers\u2019 money, using their invested funds to bankroll his lavish lifestyle \u2014 characterized by use of private jets, yacht rentals, an extravagant vacation home, a luxury car and expensive clothing,\u201D Johnson said.","The CFTC filed its civil enforcement action in the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio on Thursday.
