It is still in the experimental phase, and those running Lightning nodes also have to run Bitcoin nodes.","The transaction was a multi-sig payment, where multiple cryptographic keys are used to sign a single transaction. Normally, these kinds of transactions have a handful of participants.&nbsp;In this case, Bitmatrix Founder Burak Keceli decided to test the boundaries of what is possible. He <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brqgoo\/status\/1579216353780957185\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">created<\/a> a 998 out of 999 multi-sig \u2014 where 998 keys had to be used to sign the transaction out of a possible 999. The transaction went through and only cost the developer $4.82 in transaction fees (which is relatively cheap, considering the complexity).","The transaction caused problems for the Lightning Network. Many users <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/lightningnetwork\/lnd\/issues\/7002\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">complained<\/a> that they were unable to stay in sync with the Bitcoin network, prevent them from adding bitcoin from the network. The issue was due to a bug in the parsing library of an implementation of Bitcoin called btcd. It was <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/lightningnetwork\/lnd\/issues\/7002#issuecomment-1272654613\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mistakenly<\/a> still checking a limit from an old version of the code.","The bug has now been fixed among Lightning node implementations. This enabled Lightning node operators to sync with the Bitcoin network again.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Correction: This story has been updated to show that the bulk of the Lightning network did not go down, but merely a lot of nodes fell out of sync with it \u2014 an issue that only affected node runners from adding liquidity.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
