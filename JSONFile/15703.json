Launched initially on Ethereum, its move to layer 2 platform Arbitrum is an effort to decrease gas costs and increase transaction speeds, according to Edge & Node CEO Tegan Kline.","Arbitrum, like other Ethereum layer 2 networks, operates as a separate blockchain that runs alongside Ethereum. To reduce fees for users without losing all of Ethereum\u2019s security guarantees, Arbitrum bundles up large groups of transactions and then passes them back down to Ethereum for all-at-once settlement.","The Graph\u2019s migration involves transferring its \u201Csettlement layer\u201D from one network to another \u2013 rather than recording and settling activity directly on Ethereum, The Graph will now settle transactions on Arbitrum.","Every time a user performs a transaction on The Graph like delegating and indexing, there is a cost to it. \u201CWith this transfer to Artbitrum, those costs are lower. So we expect that there will likely be more indexers that spin up on the network [and] more delegators that get involved because that barrier to entry is lower, the cost isn\u2019t so high,\u201D Kline told CoinDesk.","GRT and ARB, the native tokens for The Graph and Arbitrum, have both remained stable in the past 24 hours amid The Graph\u2019s transition to Arbitrum. GRT has ranged between as high as 9.9 cents and as low as 9.7 cents, while ARB has oscillated between 97 cents and $1.01, per CoinDesk data.","The Graph enables developers to query data from 40 networks and raised $50 million in a 2022 funding round, which saw participation from Tiger Global, Blockwall Digital, Fenbushi Capital, FinTech Collective and Reciprocal Ventures.","Edited by Sam Kessler.","CORRECTION (June 14, 2023, 18:23 UTC): Specifies in the piece's first sentence that the final stage of The Graph's migration started Wednesday.
