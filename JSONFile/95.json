It already provides web3 infrastructure services, such as node hosting and the management of validator operations, for various blockchains on its platform, notably Ethereum, Solana, and Aptos.","Other firms joining EigenLayer as operators include <a href=\"https:\/\/app.eigenlayer.xyz\/operator\/0x696dfe30ec3d6398b5d1b9779841aa9a14faeb47\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Deutsche Telekom MMS<\/a>, HashKey Cloud, P2P, Nethermind, Figment, Everstake, Kiln and AltLayer.","This development follows the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/287435\/eigenlayer-restaking-platform-and-eigenda-data-availability-layer-debut-on-ethereum-mainnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mainnet rollout<\/a> of EigenLayer and its data availability layer EigenDA yesterday. The launch enables restakers to delegate their stake to their preferred operator and allows operators to decide whether to run an actively validated service on EigenLayer.","By participating in the EigenLayer protocol, operators provide services to other applications and process their transactions in exchange for rewards. This additional security layer is derived from the already staked ETH on the Ethereum network. For example, operators of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263473\/eigenlayer-to-enable-staking-with-operators-of-data-availability-layer-in-h1-2024\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data availability solution<\/a> will enable Layer 2 scaling solutions \u2014 to incorporate it for their scaling needs.","EigenLayer operators allow Ethereum stakers to delegate their staked assets, whether native ETH or derivative tokens, to establish a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/273732\/eigenlayer-plans-shared-security-model-for-dapps\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shared security model<\/a>. This delegation also enables stakers to engage in multiple blockchain applications while their ETH remains staked on the Ethereum network.","However, operators are not currently validating any services.
