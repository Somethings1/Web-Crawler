Besides Ethereum, numerous ecosystems, such as BNB Chain and Polygon, have developed their own market for NFTs.<\/span><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, one significant limitation of NFT projects is that they are usually minted and developed on one or two blockchains at the most. This approach has led to&nbsp; constraints such as a lack of interoperability--the sharing and access of data between two networks.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If an NFT is confined to just one blockchain, there can only be a limited number of transactions, which limits its stability and growth in price. Both users and NFT projects have a need to transfer NFTs to marketplaces and blockchains with better liquidity, such as Ethereum. NFT cross-chain can improve the current fragmentation of NFTs and enhance their liquidity. This provides users and projects with the opportunity to migrate their NFTs, when there isn\u2019t enough liquidity on the chain they are on.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another example of a limitation of the single blockchain approach, is that only the blockchain\u2019s native token can be used to buy the NFTs developed on that network. For example, NFTs on Ethereum,one of the most popular NFT platforms, can only be purchased using ETH. Moreover, Ethereum is known for its exuberant gas fees (transaction fees), forcing users to spend a substantial amount of their NFT budgets on transaction fees alone.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To provide an effective and innovative solution to this problem, and support the NFT ecosystem\u2019s development, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Poly Network launched a cross-chain NFT bridge in 2021. Poly NFT Bridge helps expand NFT marketplaces to reach a wider audience and give NFTs more exposure through cross-chain capabilities.<\/span><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Poly Network has done a great job of updating its official website. The new and refreshed website is now live and includes changes to navigation, with dropdown menus for both mobile and desktop versions. It also modified its content structure, improving readability.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On the Poly NFT Bridge site, a host of practical and impactful changes were implemented to improve user experience.

To unlock their full potential, the market needs a cross-chain interoperability protocol that is technically reliable and compatible both with digital assets and NFTs.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Poly Bridge, a cross-chain transfer bridge built on Poly Network, delivers NFT token transfers and contract cross-chain calls for heterogeneous chains. Poly NFT Bridge supports the popular NFT standards; ERC-721 and ERC-1155, with OpenSea verification API support. Users approve and lock their NFT tokens in the smart contracts, then Poly Bridge operators mint the corresponding NFT tokens using the same metadata.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Users only need to log in to the Poly NFT Bridge page (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bridge.poly.network\/nft\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">https:\/\/bridge.poly.network\/nft<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">), connect their wallet, select the NFT assets already held in the wallet, select the desired destination network, and finally click \"confirm\" to complete the NFT cross-chain transfer.<\/span><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For NFT projects interested in offering cross-chain transfers to their users, joining the Poly NFT Bridge is just as easy.
