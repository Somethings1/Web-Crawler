Solvo's Vault product allows users to earn a yield of up to 8% on coins, such as SOL and ADA, via staking. Its \"Bundles\" product allows users to invest in several tokens related to decentralized finance, the metaverse and gaming.&nbsp;","Solvo's waitlist \u2014 which currently has 5000 people \u2014 opened earlier this week. The app is set to launch on iOS in October.","The news follows in the footsteps of other startup raises in the web3 sector from former Revolut employees. Earlier this month, former Revolut chief revenue officer Alan Chang raised <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/168248\/former-revolut-employees-raise-78-million-for-web3-energy-startup\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$78 million<\/a> for his web3 energy startup, Tesseract.
