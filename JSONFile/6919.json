Minds is a blockchain-based social media startup that has recently captured the attention of major media outlets, including the <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wall Street Journal<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wired<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TechCrunch<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reuters<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. They recently closed a $10 million Series B funding round and began considering ways to put the funds to work on-chain, due to the above-average returns in digital asset markets and their commitment to the crypto ecosystem. Minds chose to allocate a portion of their raise into Circle Yield. Here\u2019s a look inside their choice.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto returns, without the volatility<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Circle Yield is denominated in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.circle.com\/en\/usdc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">USDC<\/a>, the world\u2019s fastest-growing dollar digital currency, which can be ideal for investing idle treasury balances, paying suppliers and accepting payments from customers. Yield offers a fixed term and a rate** that\u2019s much higher than those available from banks and many fixed income markets, which helps balance growth and security. Importantly, it is overcollateralized with bitcoin that\u2019s held with a third-party custodian for extra security.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe ability to create yield on our idle USDC balance is a game-changer,\u201D notes Bill Ottman, Minds\u2019 CEO. \u201CCircle Yield is helping us plan our growth, because we can project future cash flows from the earnings and budget that money into how we scale.\u201D&nbsp; Circle Yield is available in terms ranging from a month up to a year, and the ability to choose a fixed, short term can be crucial for growing companies with unpredictable working capital needs.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Circle Yield is central to Minds\u2019 treasury diversification strategy. Since it offers a fixed rate, Minds can grow their treasury reserves and minimize volatility while keeping funds on-chain. The company can also operate more simply, with USDC\u2019s stability and liquidity across numerous blockchains and in many wallets and exchanges. Since a number of Minds contractors and suppliers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.circle.com\/en\/payments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">already accept USDC as payment<\/a>, the company can pay them straight from its Circle Account without needing to reach into its bank account and deal with the friction inherent in traditional funds transfers.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In his own words<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI want to have our balance sheet work for us, and I don\u2019t think this concept should be limited to major public companies. We believe in the crypto space, so we want to leverage Circle Yield along with direct allocations into Bitcoin and Ether to capitalize on the growth and momentum of the industry.
