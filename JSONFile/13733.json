In fact, USDC currently comprises more than 50% of DAI's collateral reserves, along with other crypto and real-world assets, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/makerdao\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a> from DeFi Llama.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The use of the Peg Stability Module (PSM) intensified when USDC temporarily lost its peg, prompting investors to flock to mint DAI, likely in an effort to diversify their stablecoin holdings.
