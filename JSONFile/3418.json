The NFTs are part of a larger launch of the company\u2019s first zero-carb beer. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nWith the purchase of an NFT, consumers will have the opportunity to vote on Bud Light NEXT merchandise, have access to Bud Light NEXT brand and partner events, and more.&nbsp;","\u201CSo there will probably be a lot more than that, that won't be disclosed at the announcement time. But there's a roadmap to come,\u201D Corey Brown, senior digital director for Bud Light, told The Block.&nbsp;","Increasingly, consumer and luxury brands have been moving into utility NFTs, which offer both a digital experience and tangible value through product offerings and other perks. Just this month, The Block has reported on brands like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/130087\/clothing-retailer-gap-launches-nft-collection-on-tezos\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gap<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/130407\/shoe-company-crocs-is-eyeing-an-nft-play-according-to-trademark-application\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crocs<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/131037\/adidas-originals-and-prada-announce-a-user-generated-nft-project\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Prada<\/a> moving into the NFT space.","This isn\u2019t Anheuser-Busch's first move into NFTs. The brewery company, which has a family of brands including Bud Light, Shock Top, and Hoegaarden, launched its first NFT sale featuring 1,936 unique Budweiser digital beer can designs in November. The collection <a href=\"https:\/\/adage.com\/article\/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news\/budweisers-first-nfts-sell-out-under-hour\/2383936\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sold out<\/a> in an hour.","Despite the success, NFTs are still new and experimental for the company.","\u201CIt\u2019s new for us, for Bud Light. I think the most important thing is making sure that we are keeping our consumers in mind. That this isn\u2019t a marketing stunt. We\u2019ve done a lot so far to make sure that we have the right partners in the space and we\u2019re doing things as authentically to the community as we can,\u201D said Brown.","Brown says the company is taking a long-term approach with more things brewing in the coming months.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
