PnLink is a payments service provider, OK-BIT a virtual asset service provider.","The deals give Crypto.com Electronic Financial Transaction Act and Virtual Asset Service Provider registration, it said.","\u201CWe are committed to working with regulators to continue to bring our products and services to market, particularly in countries like South Korea where consumers have shown strong interest and adoption of digital currencies,\u201D said Kris Marszalek, Crypto.com\u2019s co-founder and CEO, in a statement.","Founded in 2016, Crypto.com serves more than 50 million customers worldwide, according to today\u2019s announcement. It already holds licenses in Singapore, Dubai, Italy, Greece and Cyprus.","This is not the first example of crypto giants attempting to navigate local regulation through acquisition. In the UK, for example, both Binance and Bitpanda have acquired smaller startups that were successfully registered under the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s anti-money laundering regime.
