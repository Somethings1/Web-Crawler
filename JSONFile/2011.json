The privacy-enabled CUSD is set to go live on the Ethereum mainnet in the third quarter of 2019.","According to Carbon CEO Sam Trautwein, this partnership would create the first privacy-wrapped fiat collateralized stablecoin on Ethereum. \u201CWe think this is an important step in the crypto space,\u201D Trautwein tells The Block.","\u201CIn the era of big data and Cambridge Analytica, privacy is something people care about,\u201D Trautwein adds.","The process to mint a private CUSD coin is as follows:","As to whether there are regulatory concerns for printing and redeeming privacy coins, Trautwein tells The Block that he does not \u201Cthink there is an answer that question today,\u201D and that Carbon is \u201Cstill waiting with bated breath to see how the regulatory [landscape] works out.\u201D Trautwein does note that all of CUSD\u2019s client will still have to pass through a \u201Cbank-level\u201D KYC process.","The AZTEC protocol uses a cryptography method called zero-knowledge proofs popularized by privacy coin Zcash.
