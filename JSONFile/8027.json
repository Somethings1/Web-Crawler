Whenever the price of USDD is below a dollar, the system allows you to burn one USDD to mint $1 worth of tron, USDD\u2019s sister token on the Tron blockchain.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">USDD first lost its dollar peg on Monday amid a broader crypto market slump. It traded around the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/151872\/tron-usdd-stablecoin-breaks-dollar-peg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$0.98 mark<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> yesterday before another dip this morning.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Amid the USDD de-peg, the price of tron (TRX) got slashed by roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/tron\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">16% today<\/a>, and is changing hands at $0.05.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With USDD losing its dollar value, there may be intense pressure on tron. This is similar to how UST\u2019s de-peg led to an implosion last month of its sister token called luna.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meanwhile, the Tron DAO Reserve, a body that exists to defend USDD's peg, has been acquiring assets to back up the stablecoin's value. It has bought <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">more than 1 billion USDC in recent days and holds an additional $500 million worth of assets like USDT, bitcoin and tron. So far, however, the team's accumulation of capital reserves has not restored confidence in USDD\u2019s value.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Therefore, in order to prepare for the worst outcome, Tron DAO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/152151\/tron-dao-reserve-pulls-2-5-billion-trx-from-binance-as-usdd-slips-further-from-peg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> today it would pull out 2.5 billion TRX (worth some $125 million) from the Binance exchange.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Taking its token off exchanges will allow the team to prevent traders from taking large short positions on the asset. This also ensures Tron DAO can maintain a large reserve of TRX tokens, adequate enough to redeem USDD holders.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
