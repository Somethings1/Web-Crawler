He noted that this potentially sends them to unregulated venues to try to get exposure, something he said isn't great for the UK. \"The UK has always said it wants to be a crypto hub. And this is one of the basic fundamentals potentially for meeting that definition,\" he said.","While the UK has recently approved the launch of crypto exchange-traded notes, these will only be available for institutional investors and not for a retail audience. That's unlike the bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which anyone can access.","As for the launch of bitcoin ETFs, Das noted how the products were adopted very quickly and that they're positive for the clients they're available to. He added that they have legitimized bitcoin in the crypto market more broadly for institutions.","Coinbase UK CEO Daniel Seifert appears to support Das's view on bringing ETFs to the UK. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/282938\/us-bitcoin-etfs-are-a-monumental-milestone-says-coinbase-uk-ceo-while-etns-in-the-uk-are-a-positive-step\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent interview<\/a>, when asked whether he would want to see bitcoin ETFs available in the UK, Seifert replied, \u201CI would say more choice for consumers is always good.\u201D","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
