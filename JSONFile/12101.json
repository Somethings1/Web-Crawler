Meanwhile, the stablecoin USDT \u2013 which is supposed to be one-to-one pegged tied to the U.S. dollar \u2013 has been trading at a premium. And bitcoin futures has also reversed the historical trend of printing a higher price than spot \u2013 it has been trading at a discount instead.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The price is definitely very volatile still, so you do see good arbitrage opportunities,\" high-frequency trader Mike van Rossum told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The opportunities van Rossum referred to lie in those aforementioned price differences, or premiums, which in an efficient and stable market shouldn\u2019t be too far away from 0. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, last Thursday, bitcoin's price fell off the $7,900 cliff and it is now hovering around $5,800, triggering a slew of large scale liquidations and trading volumes surge. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, total open interest dropped up to 18% on March 12, most of which was wiped out by liquidation. Bitcoin futures trading volumes across all exchanges surged to an all-time high, with the largest exchanges \u2013 BitMEX, OKEx, and Huobi \u2013 seeing $11 billion, $13 billion, and $8.6 billion in trading volume on March 12, respectively.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As such, bitcoin futures' annualized three-month rolling basis, which calculates the price difference between futures and spot denominated by the spot price, tanked as much as -75% on crypto derivatives exchange FTX on March 13 \u2013 a state of affairs that van Rossum described as \"wild.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: Skew<\/em>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In order to capture this spread, traders who usually long bitcoin and sell futures took a reversed strategy. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">They short-sold bitcoin while purchasing BTC futures, then used the bitcoins they receive at the delivery date of the futures contract to cover the short position. Through this reverse cash and carry scheme, a trader could pocket the difference between the money she spent on the futures contracts \u2013 which are at a discount \u2013 to the money she earned from selling the BTC.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Futures is not the only market that brews arbitrage opportunities. The premium index of BitMEX\u2019s bitcoin perpetual swaps, which tracks the price difference between the derivatives contract and its underlying asset, tumbled to as low as -12% on March 12. During quieter times, that figure usually hovers around 0.1%. <\/span>","USDT, the most liquid stablecoin on the market, also saw its premium spike to roughly 5% around the same time. This trend may continue as investors start to return to crypto now that BTC appears to have stabilized around $5,800 while equities market drags along the lower range. At least, that's the working theory at the center of an investor memo sent by crypto trading firm QCP Capital yesterday and reviewed by The Block.&nbsp;","\"The fact that BTC isn't being dragged by lower equities or the higher USD shows real demand from the fiat to stables new money coming in. Huge premiums in USDT and BTC in onshore China &amp; most other Asian markets right now,\" the note read.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: TradingView<\/em>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Lots of people are trading it [USDT] for various reasons \u2013 lots of over the counter USDT flow \u2013 creating some arbitrage opportunities,\" FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried noted in a message to The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">These movements are also reflected in the flows some lending desks were seeing over the past week. Although crypto lenders usually see more robust demand for cash and stablecoin loans with BTC collateral, the split between cash and BTC loans have been around fifty-fifty recently as traders look to borrow BTC for short selling.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We are seeing more 2 way flows now with BTC borrowing demand<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">because futures are at a discount so if you borrow BTC, you can sell spot versus buy future and earn a nice carry,\" said Tiantian Kullander, whose firm Amber Group runs a crypto lending desk along with other financial services.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To meet the increasing borrowing demand for bitcoin, crypto lender BlockFi <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/blockfi-raises-deposit-rates-as-bitcoin-crash-juices-loan-demand\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">kicked up<\/a><\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;its BTC interest rate yesterday to attract people to lend out their BTC.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It is not too surprising to see large borrowers such as BlockFi raising the rates they can pay to borrow bitcoin or ether from their customers. They can then for instance lend at a profit to crypto hedge funds and lending desks that are looking to do the reverse cash carry trade or even implement [such a strategy] themselves,\" said Emmanuel Goh, who is the CEO of crypto derivatives data analytics firm Skew.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To be sure, by now, most of those premiums have been arbitraged away, as BitMEX\u2019s premium index and BTC futures basis have reverted back to 0 and -10% range. However, there are still some spreads left for traders to capture.<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp; <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As van Rossum who primarily trades in swaps, noted, \"in perp[etual swaps] the spreads aren't huge, but still plenty to go around.\"<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
