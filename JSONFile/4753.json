Elixir\u2019s adoption by order book exchanges across the space, paired with the strong technology it\u2019s been developing for over two years, positions them to be among the leaders for order book liquidity on exchanges.\u201D","This latest Series A funding round follows <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/202510\/falconx-bitmex-founder-hayes-invest-in-market-maker-elixir-amid-dearth-of-providers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Elixir's seed round in January<\/a>, which raised $2.1m with support from FalconX, Commonwealth, Chapter One, Ava Labs and BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes.","\u201CWe are excited to have closed our Series A as we head into our launch,\u201D Elixir co-founder and CEO Philip Forte said. \u201CWith this latest round of funding, we\u2019re able to expand our in-person team, as well as bolster our engineering effort to expedite our roadmap to support additional use cases leveraging our protocol infrastructure.\u201D","Elixir\u2019s current 17-person team includes veterans from firms like Gemini, Hudson River Trading and Tokensoft.","Centralized exchanges have always favored order books as the most efficient trading environment. More decentralized exchanges are now gravitating toward this model, but limited liquidity remains a challenge.","Order book-based decentralized exchanges enable users to directly execute orders with other traders in a similar way to centralized exchanges but on-chain, retaining full custody of their crypto assets while placing trades. This contrasts with the dominant automated market maker DEX model, using liquidity pool smart contracts to facilitate the decentralized trading of specific token pairs.","Elixir allows users to supply liquidity directly to pairs on order book exchanges and earn maker rewards with a similar risk-return profile to AMMs, the team said. By incentivizing deeper liquidity, Elixir aims to create a more efficient trading environment characterized by tighter bid-ask spreads and increased volume.","Elixir\u2019s delegated Proof-of-Stake protocol is expected to launch on mainnet in the coming weeks, integrating with decentralized exchanges like Vertex, Bluefin and WooFi. Elixir is also set to power permissionless market features on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/257984\/dydx-public-benefit-corporation-v4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dYdX V4<\/a> early next year, according to the team.","Â© 2023 The Block.
