In fact, Chainlink's Transaction Value Enabled (TVE) \u2014 which is a measure of its total value of facilitated transactions \u2014 sits at $6.1 trillion, Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov told The Block. This figure includes transactions such as swaps, borrowing, and derivatives.","The SCALE program is an initiative within Chainlink\u2019s broader <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.chain.link\/chainlink-staking-roadmap\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Economics 2.0<\/a> program, which aims to improve data security, utility, and operating costs of Chainlink oracle services.","The initial blockchains collaborating with Chainlink Labs on this initiative are Avalanche, Metis, Moonbeam, and Moonriver. Each ecosystem will contribute toward oracle networking operating costs.","Nazarov said Chainlink Economics 2.0 and SCALE put in a place a \u201Cholistic economic model\u201D that is viable for the long-term success of blockchains, decentralized applications, and the Chainlink ecosystem."],"hashtag":["AVALANCHE","STAKING"]}
