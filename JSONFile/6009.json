And with everyone from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/139238\/madonna-becomes-the-latest-celeb-to-flaunt-a-new-bored-ape\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Madonna<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/115333\/visa-buys-cryptopunk-first-steps-nft-commerce\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Visa<\/a> buying NFTs, The Block sat down with Taylor to understand how pros like her start putting a dollar figure on a few lines of code.","\u201CNFTs are a totally different beast\u201D to traditional art, Taylor said via video call. \u201CYou have so many other considerations because, with NFTs, you have tangibility, you have utility. There's functions of these things. It's not just a collectible item.\u201D","When valuing a traditional piece of art, the first question in any appraiser\u2019s mind is, \u201Cwhat is the purpose of the appraisal?\u201D she explained. If the valuation is for an insurance policy, then she\u2019ll be working to calculate the so-called <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">retail replacement value<\/i> \u2013 how much it would cost to buy an equivalent piece were this one to get destroyed somehow.","But if, to give another example, the appraisal is for a wealthy individual who wants to write off tax against a museum donation, then she\u2019d calculate the <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fair market value<\/i> \u2013 which may well be lower than the replacement value.","And whereas traditional artworks will mainly be judged for their beauty, collectability, rarity and provenance, appraising an NFT\u2019s value brings a whole host of new factors into play.","For a start, Taylor points out, some NFTs have an inbuilt utility \u2014 allowing you to defeat a video game boss or granting access to a real-world country club, for example. And others confer ownership of underlying assets, like the copyright on an artwork.","To complicate things further, NFTs trade on blockchain networks which may themselves experience large swings in price. The price of ether on the Ethereum network, where the vast majority of NFTs live, has been as low as $1,800 and as high as $4,800 over the past year.","\u201CAbout 10 different data points get tracked every day,\u201D Taylor says. \u201CBecause these things sit on blockchains, they\u2019re sitting on a volatile currency.\u201D","Appraisers produce a detailed report \u2014 the example Taylor shared with The Block is 20 pages long \u2014 examining how much collectors have paid for similar works in recent years, at galleries and at auction. These valuations should conform to a manual of ethics and standards known as USPAP, the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, with appraisers having to complete regular training to stay compliant.","The entrance of professional appraisers into NFTs is an intriguing development for crypto, a market that can trace its mistrust of centralized authorities and middlemen all the way back to the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008.","But while those happy simply to buy and sell NFTs can trade at the market price, those purchasing insurance or writing a will may well be forced to seek out appraisers such as Taylor, who can give an independent expert\u2019s view.","And while some practices from the art world rub off on crypto, perhaps some of crypto\u2019s culture of transparency and traceability will rub off in return.","\u201CThe art world is very opaque and a lot of business is done in a very opaque way,\u201D according to Taylor. \u201CIn a private sale, you're not going to know who the other party is for the most part and that's something that regulators have taken an interest in. Because the big issue is money laundering, of course \u2014 just wires coming in and out. And if you don't know who the buyer is or where the money's coming from, that\u2019s a problem.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
