Subscribe to Valid Points here.","While weeks and months in crypto often feel like years, it has only been 60 days since the hard fork that contained EIP 1559 was implemented on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet. A world of data regarding EIP 1559 has surfaced, but ultimately the upgrade is still in its infancy.","In fact, a few weeks ago, I wrote about Nic Carter\u2019s somewhat overly eager Ethereum takeaways and how it was probably too early to estimate EIP 1559\u2032s impact on the network. However, this week I am changing my tone a bit and looking at the potential implications of the upgrade\u2019s base fee burn and its effect on the longevity of Ethereum.","At a very high level, under proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS), Ethereum uses block rewards to incentivize miners and validators of the chain. This incentive helps properly secure the network by paying those that are beneficial for confirming transactions and logging the state of the chain, which in turn encourages competition to grow a large and distributed base of miners\/validators.","Bitcoin uses a similar model, but every four years the amount paid in block rewards decreases until the reward is extremely negligible and the bitcoin supply tops at 21 million. As block rewards become negligible, bitcoin miners will be forced to rely on transaction fees in order to remain profitable. Reasonably, the network will have to maintain a level of activity high enough to pay miners for their services.","Ethereum and EIP 1559, on the other hand, now take a reverse approach to Bitcoin\u2019s security budget. EIP 1559 took away the vast majority of transaction fee revenue that miners previously received, but Ethereum will continue to emit block rewards to miners (and eventually validators), indefinitely. While Ethereum takes an uncapped supply approach, the newly introduced fee burn will help counteract ether\u2019s inflation.","Bitcoin\u2019s role as a hedge against inflation has certainly been a huge part of the asset\u2019s success. However, its \u201Cdigital gold\u201D narrative leads to lower network activity as the asset is considered a store of value rather than a medium of exchange, at least for the time being. This issue has left some wondering if transaction fees will be enough to keep miners interested, if miners will adapt or if the network will have to pivot to an updated compensation model.","It\u2019s likely wrong to say that EIP 1559 \u201Csolved\u201D this issue of paying miners into perpetuity, because again bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply is what makes investing in the asset so attractive. Ether\u2019s supply, on the other hand, will be extremely dependent on network activity and the demand for blockspace. The Bitcoin network is years away from the concern becoming a reality and will likely surprise me with its ability to adapt and survive.","My comparison between the two networks is strictly how they approach miner incentives, something I believe EIP 1559 possibly addressed with its fee burn mechanism. A future in which Ethereum can continue to subsidize validators without diluting those that hold ether is very promising for the network.","The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week.
