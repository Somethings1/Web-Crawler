This anticipation stems from a very tangible, long-standing function of stablecoins acting as a hedge against market volatility while serving a real-world purpose as a store of value in the form of \u201Cprogrammable money.\u201D&nbsp;","Despite this optimistic outlook, today\u2019s most prominent stablecoins face some limitations that may hinder their future growth. For example, a growling number of chains and app chains must rely on \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbctv18.com\/cryptocurrency\/explained-what-are-wrapped-coins-and-how-they-function-12405852.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrapped<\/span><\/a>\u201D stablecoins, dependent on cross-chain bridges with uncertain security. Also, the economic benefits from reserve assets backing stablecoins are often captured by a few centralized players instead of being used to support decentralized ecosystems.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp; <\/span>Finally, many stablecoins struggle to provide transparent verification of their assets, as shown by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/273263\/trueusd-continues-to-depeg-hits-low-point-of-0-97\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent depeg of TUSD<\/span><\/a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp; <\/span>For stablecoins to achieve their potential in coming years, decentralized markets will require a \u201Cnext generation\u201D of technology and features.","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Omnichain Expansion<\/b>","Accessibility is a key factor in the success of stablecoins, especially as we enter an omnichain future. Acting as a pegged unit of account for lending, borrowing, and other financial services across multiple blockchain ecosystems, stablecoins face the practical need to use fiat-linked money in cross-blockchain transactions. In this respect, interoperability is paramount. Solutions enabling decentralization offer omnichain interoperability, offering fair distribution of value, enhancing accessibility and adaptability across the ecosystem. LayerZero\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/layerzero.gitbook.io\/docs\/evm-guides\/layerzero-omnichain-contracts\/oft\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OFT standard<\/span><\/a> \u2013 and the recent introduction of <a href=\"https:\/\/usdv.money\/about\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">USDV<\/span><\/a>, a stablecoin designed with interoperable OFT standard integration at launch \u2013 exemplifies a new generation of stablecoins that overcome the dangerous prospect of \u201Cone-chain-above-all\u201D by promoting interoperability across an ecosystem of multiple blockchain communities.","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Decentralized Value<\/b>","Instead of relying on a centralized private entity to issue stablecoins, a better model could involve a robust community of stablecoin minters to facilitate sustainability and adoption. Achieving this goal requires a new mechanism to track and share economic value, which can in turn provide incentives to minters and ensure equitable rewards for their contributions. Such a decentralized model is inherently more scalable, enabling stablecoins to circulate as fungible tokens across more geographies and use cases, with deeper liquidity pools and connections to many more chains.","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Transparency: Gone are the days of audit reports<\/b>","Although all cryptocurrencies consider \u2018transparency\u2019 to be a fundamental principle inherent in blockchain technology, the reality is that it\u2019s easy for crypto-ventures to obscure certain information, especially when it comes to financials. Stablecoins, in particular, may not always provide visibility around underlying reserves. Through innovations like <a href=\"https:\/\/chain.link\/education-hub\/proof-of-reserves\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on-chain Proof of Reserves<\/span><\/a> \u2013 which allow real-time public attestations of reserves on the blockchain \u2013 stablecoins like USDV provide true transparency and immediate access to financial metrics.","Now, as stablecoins become increasingly instrumental in various blockchain financial applications \u2013 from payments and lending to financial products \u2013 reimagining stablecoins and bringing an era of the new generation of stablecoins will be critical in uncapping crypto\u2019s potential and real-world applications.","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About the author: President of the Verified USD Foundation, Matthew Commons<\/i>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Matthew is a senior executive and serial entrepreneur in the FinTech and Web3 fields.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp; <\/span>At the <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/usdv.money\/about\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Verified USD Foundation<\/i><\/span><\/a><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, he focuses on facilitating seamless, equitable, and transparent on-chain and off-chain digital asset transactions.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp; <\/span>Committed to fostering a shared digital asset ecosystem, the Foundation uses an orphan special purpose vehicle (SPV) structure to manage stablecoin reserves, upholding the highest standards of transparency and fiduciary duty.
