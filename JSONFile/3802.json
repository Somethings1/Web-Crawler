Because they take place on-chain, orders are irreversible once executed. However, they can be adjusted on-chain.","Bancor also claims Carbon is \"resistant to MEV [maximal extractable value] sandwich attacks.\" Sandwich attacks are when a bot <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227110\/mev-trading-bot-memecoins-subway\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">identifies<\/a> a pending user transaction and submits a transaction with a higher gas price to buy or sell the same cryptocurrency just before the user's transaction, causing a price change. The bot then executes another quick transaction to buy or sell the cryptocurrency \u2014 effectively taking advantage of the change.","Juxtaposed against Uniswap V3 \u2014 the latest and most-efficient iteration of the leading decentralized exchange \u2014 Carbon allows users to create a single concentrated liquidity position that buys and sells exclusively in specific price ranges.","With Carbon, trading ranges for purchasing and selling can be established above and below a specified price, depending on a user's prediction of where a particular token will be traded. This automates the \"swing trading\" procedure for any conventional ERC20 token.","For instance, if a trader anticipates that ether will hover between $2,000 and $2,300 in the near term, they can create a Carbon strategy to automatically buy ether within the $2,000-$2,100 range and sell it within the $2,200-$2,300 range.","Backtesting has demonstrated a 2-3.4 times profit enhancement compared to traditional concentrated liquidity provision methods, according to Bancor.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/dex-non-custodial\/share-of-dex-volume-monthly\/embed\" title=\"Share of DEX Volume\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
