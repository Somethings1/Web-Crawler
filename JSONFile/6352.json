Initially, Stargate will enable USDT for Metis across Ethereum, Avalanche, and BNB Chain, with plans to expand interoperability further.<\/span>","The ability to transfer liquidity across blockchain networks is a key part of web3 interoperability. Yet, most existing cross-chain bridges are unable to send native assets between chains without relying on wrapped tokens for the bridging process.","Bridging with wrapped tokens relies on multi-step locked liquidity models \u2014 locking up a crypto asset on one chain with a corresponding wrapped token minted on another. Regardless of whether those locked funds are stored in a multi-sig, smart contract or with a third-party custodian, they can become a target, with over $2.5 billion stolen from such cross-chain bridges in the past two years. In fact, a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tokenterminal\/status\/1582376876143968256\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">study<\/a> showed around 50% of all DeFi exploits occurred on cross-chain bridges.","Built on the interoperability protocol LayerZero, Stargate is designed to avoid the need for wrapped tokens, improving security, its team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/139078\/stargate-bridge-attracts-2-billion-of-liquidity-within-a-week-of-launch\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claims<\/a>.&nbsp;","Stargate\u2019s fully composable native asset bridge enables the transfer of native tokens between different blockchains in a single transaction.
