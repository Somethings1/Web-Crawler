The post came one day after the Kraken exchange shut down its staking services in the U.S. in response to a Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement action.&nbsp;","\u201CGiven the importance of this technology, getting regulation wrong could do serious harm to the development of the crypto industry in the U.S.,\u201D Grewal wrote. By presenting \u201Caggressive mandates\u201D and superimposing securities laws onto the staking ecosystem, regulators may \u201Cprevent U.S. consumers from accessing basic crypto services and push users to offshore, unregulated platforms,\u201D he added.","\u201CStaking is not a security under the U.S. Securities Act, nor under the Howey Test, which the SEC uses to determine whether an investment contract is a security,\u201D said Grewal, adding that the topic of whether it should even be applied to crypto at all merits a separate discussion.","Since staking customers \u201Cretain full ownership of their assets at all times, as well as the right to 'unstake' those assets consistent with the underlying protocol,\u201D the related services \u201Cdo not constitute an investment of money, even under an expanded definition,\u201D Grewal said.","Staking also fails to meet Howey\u2019s criteria for common enterprise \u201Cbecause assets are staked on decentralized networks\u201D and transactions are validated \u201Cthrough a community of users, not a common enterprise,\u201D Grewal said. Nor do staking services meet the Howey Test's \u201Creasonable expectation of profits,\u201D he added.&nbsp;","Staking rewards are determined via protocol, not Coinbase. \u201CTherefore, this does not meet the case law definition of common enterprise,\u201D said Grewal.","\u201CFinally, staking services do not pay rewards based on the \u2018efforts of others,'\" Grewal said. \u201CService providers' staking services are not entrepreneurial, managerial, or a significant factor in whether customers receive staking rewards or the amount of rewards received.\u201D","\u201CThese are IT services, not investment services,\u201D he said.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
