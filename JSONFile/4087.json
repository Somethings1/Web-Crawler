It also claims that DLN transferring liquidity instead of locking it avoids the risk of Maximum Extractable Value, Automated Market Maker (AMM) fees for wrapped assets, and the creation of honeypots from hackers.","DLN differs from the current popular bridging model in which users lock a token and receive a wrapped asset.
