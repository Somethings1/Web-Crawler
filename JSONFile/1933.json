Now, over a half of all stablecoins traded are flowing to non-U.S. licensed exchanges, the report says.&nbsp;<\/span>","\"U.S. regulators have a strong interest in exercising some regulatory authority over stablecoins, given the central role of USD-denominated reserves to these assets,\" <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis said. \"Stablecoin regulation also gives regulators a chance to help ensure that the U.S. is home to the cryptocurrency businesses that will play a big role in expanding how the U.S. dollar is used globally as the digital economy continues to grow. However, data suggests that more and more stablecoin activity is occurring through entities that aren\u2019t licensed in the United States. \"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Chainalysis, North America is still dominating global DeFi volume, but the share of decentralized protocols in overall volume has been declining over the past year.
