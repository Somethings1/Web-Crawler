{"summary":"The SEC&#x27;s investigation into crypto infrastructure firm Paxos seems to signal a new phase of crypto crackdown from SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s reported move to sue Paxos over a stablecoin called BUSD could spread to others. Others say it contributes more evidence to the need for legislation.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/211214\/sec-action-against-paxos-paints-regulatory-target-on-stablecoins","publishDate":"2023-02-13T17:58:19","id":4683,"type":null,"title":"SEC action against Paxos paints regulatory target on stablecoins","category":["POLICY"],"content":["<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stablecoins look to be the next part of the crypto ecosystem facing a regulatory crackdown.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has issued notice to crypto infrastructure provider Paxos over its involvement in Binance USD stablecoin, alleging that the stablecoin is an unregistered security. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The New York Department of Financial Services also issued a consumer alert Monday morning saying that the state financial regulator, \"ordered Paxos to cease minting Paxos-issued BUSD as a result of several unresolved issues related to Paxos\u2019 oversight of its relationship with Binance in regard to Paxos-issued BUSD\".&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to a statement from Paxos, the notice it received a likely enforcement action from the SEC was only related to BUSD, which is the third largest stablecoin by total supply.
