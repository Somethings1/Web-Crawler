In fact, JP Morgan was quietly buying BTC dips at the same time Jamie Dimon was publicly decrying Bitcoin as a fraud, and earlier this year Chase Bank opened up access to six crypto funds for clients who are looking to increase their crypto investment exposure.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The past year has seen a seismic shift in terms of cryptocurrency acceptance among larger professional investors, and 52% of institutional investors worldwide currently invest in digital assets, according to new research by Fidelity Digital Assets. Moreover, 71% of these institutional investors plan to buy or invest in more digital assets in the future.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Clearly, there is a growing demand and acceptance of cryptocurrencies as investments \u2013 and not just from casual traders on Robinhood. However, while smaller crypto traders are busy swing trading and gambling with Dogecoin and other \u201Cmemecoins\u201D, many of the larger investors are generating steady profits in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DeFi is a broad term that encapsulates a wide variety of decentralized lending platforms and crypto exchanges \u2013 all capable of operating without a centralized intermediary. The automation of essentially all back-end processes dramatically eliminates overhead costs and allows for significant investor yields that are essentially unheard of within the world of legacy finance.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For instance, our centralized lending platform Vauld allows investors to earn up to 12.68% APY on USD-backed stablecoins \u2013 which maintain the same value\/purchasing power as the U.S. dollar and are therefore insulated from broader crypto\/stock market movements. Investors who use Vauld are able to generate significant yields the moment they fund their account, with zero deposit or withdrawal fees and no mandatory lockup periods. And even though Vauld has yet to encounter any serious security breaches, Vauld\u2019s investor funds are insured to the tune of $100 million by Lloyd\u2019s London, meaning our users can recover their funds even in the event of a serious platform breach.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Every day, more individual and institutional investors are taking advantage of the impressive yields enabled through DeFi platforms \u2013 and Vauld offers the highest yields in the industry. As a result, record sums have been poured into DeFi protocols, and the total value locked up in DeFi protocols spiked to $60bn this May \u2014 up from less than $1bn at the start of 2020. In other words, this growing sector is already generating substantial, tangible wealth for countless people around the world.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s possible to become a millionaire overnight by risking it all in a game of roulette. However, Vauld is meant for investors who are tired of gambling and would rather prioritize consistent, long-term value creation. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vauld.com\/auth\/register\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Register with Vauld today<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and start building lasting wealth.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
