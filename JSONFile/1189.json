The fund is anchored by two public pensions and several other institutions invested including a university endowment, a hospital system, an insurance company, and a private foundation. Morgan Creek Digital is a unit of North Carolina-based Morgan Creek, a hedge fund.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The fund will primarily make equity-based investments in seed-stage companies active in the blockchain space but it will also invest in security tokens and cryptocurrencies. Morgan Creek has previously invested in firms such as Bakkt, Harbor, and Coinbase.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Katherine Molnar, Chief Investment Officer of Fairfax County Police Officer\u2019s Retirement System, an investor in the new fund, said that it is important \u201Cto be opportunistic and [is] excited to participate in [the blockchain industry] due to the attractive asymmetric return profile that it represents.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The two pension funds that invested in Morgan Creek\u2019s fund both manage more than $5 billion in assets under management, which means that an investment in Morgan Creek\u2019s new fund represents a tiny position for them. Pompliano told CoinDesk that, as far as he knows, no other blockchain-oriented fund has raised money from a public pension. Jason Williams said that he thinks \u201Cmany of the largest, most valuable companies of tomorrow will be built using [blockchain] technology.\"<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
