Base is a scaling solution that processes transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain, thereby providing a more affordable network for dapps.","Moreover, this Layer 2 solution is anticipated to become the default network for Coinbase\u2019s on-chain products. \u201CWe\u2019re thrilled to announce that Base mainnet is now live and available for everyone. At launch, there are 100+ dapps and service providers available in the Base ecosystem, as well as deep integrations across the Coinbase product ecosystem,\u201D said Pollak.","Coinciding with Base\u2019s public mainnet rollout, it has started what it calls an \u201Conchain summer\u201D event. Spanning several weeks, this event emphasizes promoting Base\u2019s mainnet partner dapps in the realms of digital art, music, and gaming. Notably, users will have the option to mint a unique \u201CBase, Day One\u201D NFT in celebration of the Base mainnet\u2019s opening.","In the lead-up to this launch, both developers and users have already transferred assets valued at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243379\/bridged-assets-to-coinbases-layer-2-top-100-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">over $100 million<\/a> to the network.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
