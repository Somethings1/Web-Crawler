Since some big projects suddenly gave governance tokens to their early users in 2020, people have been trying to game the system by performing actions that they think will make them eligible for future airdrops by other projects. Typically this was focused on on-chain activity, such as making transactions on a blockchain network.","However, recent airdrops, such as Celestia and Starknet, have switched up their distribution criteria. Celestia gave out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/253024\/celestia-is-airdropping-60-million-tokens-in-bid-to-build-its-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">6% of its supply<\/a> in its airdrop, with a third of that going to contributors, largely on GitHub.","The Starknet Foundation has allocated roughly 7% of its airdrop \u2014 set to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/277379\/starknet-strk-token-distribution-plan\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">open claims<\/a> on Feb. 20 \u2014 to contributing developers. Starknet developers constituted 2% of the 700 million token airdrop, alongside 5% allocated to Ethereum and open-source developers outside web3.&nbsp;","One eligible contributor who did a simple spell check <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tomkysar\/status\/1757684717699424510\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">received<\/a> 1,800 Starknet tokens from a single comment that wasn\u2019t even merged. This was likely because eligible Starknet developers included those who contributed at least three commits to a repository featured in the Electric Capital report for Starknet prior to Nov. 15, 2023. At current <a href=\"https:\/\/app.aevo.xyz\/perpetual\/strk\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pre-launch prices<\/a>, that could be worth $3,200.","Unsurprisingly, now that this is a criterion for inclusion, airdrop hunters are targeting GitHub repositories for projects that don\u2019t have tokens yet.","One airdrop strategist cited the Starknet airdrop to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Abrahamchase09\/status\/1759101213381959960\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">justify contributing<\/a> to the Scroll GitHub in the hope of getting an extra share of any potential airdrop. \u201COpen-source contributions play a vital role in the digital age,\u201D they said.","Pseudo <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudotheos\/status\/1759218915387834854\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> that the Scroll GitHub repository received more than 1,000 comments over the weekend, the vast majority coming from airdrop farmers. A look at one of the main <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/matter-labs\/zksync\/issues\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">zkSync repositories<\/a> shows an increase in comments there too, with people making basic requests such as that the project should integrate with another protocol.&nbsp;","\u201CAirdrop farmers are part of the crypto community too, but it\u2019s important for people to contribute based on their strengths rather than following trends. Outside of GitHub, we are seeing healthy ecosystem growth as well, being the fastest growing rollup as per L2beat. Scroll has always been community first, and there\u2019s room for everyone,\u201D Pseudo told The Block.","There are some ways for projects to prevent spam on GitHub. For instance, Pseudo has introduced a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/communities\/moderating-comments-and-conversations\/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">temporary limit<\/a> on submissions for a week, they said. However, while it\u2019s easy to block newly created accounts, the <a href=\"https:\/\/dev.to\/nikpoltoratsky\/how-to-deal-with-github-spambots-5e6n\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issue becomes trickier<\/a> when airdrop farmers have GitHub accounts that they\u2019ve used for a while and have made multiple comments with \u2014 since it\u2019s harder to distinguish them from genuine contributors.","The comments might not be all bad, though, as the easiest fixes involve finding spelling mistakes. Or, as Synthetix Spartan Council member Millie X <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/llamaonthebrink\/status\/1759254605332926702\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">put it<\/a>, \u201Cthe silver lining in the new airdrop farming meta is that all crypto github repos will have perfect grammar now at least.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: Pseudo confirmed that the temporary limit has been implemented.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["DEVELOPER TOOLS","WALLETS"]}
