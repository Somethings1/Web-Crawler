China is leading the list with 206 unicorns, followed by the U.S. at 203, both countries together accounting for over 80% of the world\u2019s unicorns. Europe has 35 unicorns.","Specifically, in the blockchain industry, topping the list is Chinese cryptocurrency mining hardware firm Bitmain, with a valuation of $12 billion. Bitmain rivals Canaan and Ebang, both based in China, are also on the list, with valuations of $3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.","Other blockchain firms on the list include - Coinbase, Ripple, Circle Internet Financial, Binance, EOS blockchain maker Block.One, decentralized cloud startup Dfinity, blockchain tech company BitFury and Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid Global.","","","Ripple and Circle have a valuation of $5 billion and $3 billion, respectively, according to the Hurun list.
