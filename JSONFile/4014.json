Grewal also noted that his views don't necessarily reflect the agency's.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The crypto industry has criticized the SEC for what many call \"regulation by enforcement,\" while SEC Chair Gary Gensler has argued that most cryptocurrencies are securities and should be regulated similarly to other investments.
