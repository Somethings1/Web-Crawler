Due to the large number of crypto projects this cycle, however, there has been a flow of capital into specific sectors like the Solana ecosystem and AI based projects rather than a gradual spreading of capital into all alt coin markets,\" Kooner added.","The next bitcoin halving will likely occur in April of this year, and the event will reduce the reward that miners receive for validating and adding new blocks to the blockchain by 50%.","The halving occurs approximately every four years, or after every 210,000 blocks are mined. The last halving occurred in 2020, when the block reward was reduced from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25 bitcoin.","The next halving will occur after the mining of approximately 840,000 blocks, leading to a further reduction in the block reward from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This mechanism is programmed into the bitcoin protocol and is intended to control the supply of new bitcoins, making it more scarce over time.","The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization decreased by over 1% in the past 24 hours to $52,056 at 1:19 p.m. ET, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's Price Page<\/a>.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
