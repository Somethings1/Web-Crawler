Once it passes its version of the regulation, the three bodies will enter into largely opaque negotiations called trilogues.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Central to the new legislation is the creation of an EU-wide regulator for anti-money laundering. Though the legislative bodies still need to negotiate, there seems to be minimal disagreement that such a regular is needed and that it should have direct oversight over crypto asset service providers in the EU.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the past, European Parliament has been the most aggressive of the three bodies in terms of calling for regulation of cryptocurrency. As such, the body is especially unlikely to oppose giving the future regulator direct supervision over crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dubbed \u201CAnti-Money Laundering Authority,\u201D or \u201CAMLA,\u201D the regulator will monitor at least \u201Chigh-risk\u201D crypto firms as financial servicers directly, per the Commission and Counsel versions.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A parliamentary briefing shared with The Block describes the new system as follows:&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CEU-level supervision consisting of a hub and spoke model \u2013 i.e. supervisor at the EU level competent for direct supervision of certain financial institutions (FIs), indirect <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">supervision\/coordination of the other FIs, and a coordination role for supervising the <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">non-financial sector as a first step.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The international body will be a major shift for the EU.
