{"summary":"POAPs have emerged as a new way of keeping an immutable record of your life experiences, including virtual and in-person events.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/learn\/poaps-what-is-a-proof-of-attendance-protocol\/","publishDate":"2022-02-22T16:30:12","id":15787,"type":null,"title":"POAPs: What Is a Proof of Attendance Protocol?","category":["Learn"],"content":["Whether used as digital artwork, avatar or an in-game asset, the applications of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have grown exponentially over the past few years. However, one of the more pragmatic use cases that were introduced during ETHDenver in 2019 is called a Proof of Attendance Protocol \u2013 or \u201CPOAP\u201D for short.","A Proof of Attendance Protocol (pronounced poh-ap) is a unique NFT given to people to commemorate and prove they attended an event (virtual or physical). Often referred to as \"an ecosystem for the preservation of memories,\" over time people can accrue a collection of POAPs to document their physical life experiences and activity through cyberspace.","Attendees to Crypto State by CoinDesk, our virtual event that visits Southeast Asia on Feb. 24, will receive a POAP as a memento. Register here.","In essence, POAPs can almost be thought of as an upgrade to \u201Cchecking in\u201D or tagging a location\/person on social media, as users don\u2019t reveal any sensitive personal data by doing so.","A few examples of events that gave out POAPs include EthGlobal, Dappcon and the Ethereum Community Conference in Paris. The metaverse ecosystem Decentraland also regularly sends POAPs to its users to help commemorate in-game events like the 10 million user party hosted by MetaMask in 2021.","Given the number of scams and knockoffs in cryptocurrency markets, for something to be vetted as a POAP, it must be minted (created) through the official POAP smart contract, contain metadata related to a specific time and date and also have an image associated with the event or community.","To help prevent the high price of gas (transaction fees) on the Ethereum mainnet, POAPs moved to the significantly cheaper and faster Ethereum sidechain called Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai) in October 2020. Due to the low fees on Gnosis, POAPs are usually distributed for free and displayed on the official app. As the underlying dynamics of Gnosis are compatible with Ethereum, collectors can still convert their POAPs to the Ethereum mainnet if they pay the required gas fees.","Although growing a collection of POAP badges can help people show off their decentralized identities, holders can also benefit from added financial and community perks.","Some brands or DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) use POAPs to reward and build closer, long-term relationships with their most dedicated members. Bankless DAO, for example, airdropped tokens to the wallets of subscribers who had previously claimed Bankless POAPs. The added bonus, in this case, was that if a subscriber had collected more than one Bankless POAP, they could receive a larger portion of the airdrop (more tokens).","While more niche-specific, a POAP collection can also be viewed as a blockchain-style resume. As the underlying technology reflects immutable data, some employers may find POAPs a more credible, transparent way to view and track the support of potential applicants in a community.","Other benefits include aspects such as:","Claiming a POAP is fairly simple. As per the POAP FAQ, there are several options available depending on the type of event:","Generally, people can either scan a QR code or click a link on the webpage that has created the POAP. They will then need to enter an Ethereum wallet address to receive it.","Once received, badges can be viewed on POAP scan or any interface that supports Etherscan or OpenSea by typing the Ethereum wallet address or directly linking MetaMask, WalletConnect or Portis. For mobile devices, collections can be viewed on the POAP App on iOS or Android. Once a wallet is connected, people can then share their POAPs on a range of supported social platforms, including Twitter, Reddit or Telegram.","An official guide has also been created for directly viewing POAPs on MetaMask rather than through POAP scan.","Ever since the POAP project launched on Gnosis Chain (xDai) in October 2020, its value has grown significantly across several ecosystems. Platforms like SushiSwap distribute badges to engage with members who attend weekly community meetings, participate in ask me anything (AMA) sessions or vote on governance proposals (a method that helps a group of people determine the direction of a decentralized network or organization). With that said, POAPs also have wider growth potential with suggested applications like social graphs and helping to better reflect online identities.","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has alluded to POAP playing a more prominent role in the future with the mainnet.","\n","A detailed step-by-step guide on how to set up POAPs for events can be found on the official website. We\u2019ve also provided a summarized version below:","Further support:","Enter the number of requested codes (the number of additional codes you need). To receive the new codes, you will need your edit code, which was emailed to you after creating the new POAP."],"entity":[{"type":"POAP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Southeast Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gnosis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankless POAPs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Paris","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"MetaMask","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Feb. 24","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto State","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bankless POAP","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"AMA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dappcon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum Community Conference","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["NFTs","Intermediate","Learn"],"authors":["Mason Marcobello"]}
