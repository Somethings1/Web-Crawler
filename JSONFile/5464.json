On Aug. 16, the defendant wrote to the government stating, \u201Cplease take notice of our intent to rely on a defense of advice of counsel at trial.\u201D The government informed the defense counsel that the notice was insufficiently detailed and moved to require additional disclosures.","On Aug. 23, lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/246995\/bankman-fried-plans-to-place-partial-blame-on-previous-legal-advice-in-october-trial\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> they planned to argue that he was given legal advice on matters including auto-delete policies and loans to FTX and Alameda which made him believe he was \u201Cacting in good faith.\u201D Specifically, lawyers representing jailed Bankman-Fried said they plan to \u201Celicit evidence\u201D that lawyers from Fenwick &amp; West LLP and in-house counsel were involved in \u201Creviewing and approving\u201D certain decisions.","However, the defense \u201Cdeclined to provide any additional information about the nature of the reliance on counsel, or to produce discovery as the government had requested,\u201D U.S. Attorney Damian Williams wrote to Judge Lewis Kaplan in the filing.","The government argued that mere involvement of attorneys doesn't necessarily prove the defendant's innocence or good faith, citing several cases to highlight the importance of clarity in presenting an advice-of-counsel defense. In particular, the government pointed to the need for defendants to provide evidence that they genuinely sought legal advice, disclosed all relevant facts to their counsel and acted based on that advice.","In a response <a href=\"https:\/\/storage.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940\/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.240.0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> Wednesday morning, Bankman-Fried\u2019s current lawyer, Mark Cohen, said disclosures regarding the advice-of-counsel strategy were sufficient but added that his release was necessary to prepare his defense.","\u201CAt the present time, the defense is unable to adequately prepare for trial and prepare the defense, which is a violation of Mr. Bankman-Fried\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights,\u201D Cohen said.&nbsp;","\u201CInternet access provided to Mr. Bankman-Fried two days a week is woefully inadequate, and the ability of counsel to consult with and discuss the defense with Mr. Bankman-Fried has proven to be cumbersome,\u201D Cohen added.","Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense also took issue with the government's late production of discovery materials, especially given the proximity to the trial date.","On Aug. 22, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to seven counts, and his lawyer said the former billionaire was eating only peanut butter, bread and water in jail.
