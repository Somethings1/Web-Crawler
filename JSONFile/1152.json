Every Ethereum transaction has to pay a transaction fee and these can be quite expensive, particularly for complex transactions like ones typically used by DEXs. White said, however, that this proposal manages to execute the trades in a way that\u2019s efficient for transaction fees (using some \u201Clucky math\u201D).","But the idea is still in its early stages. White added: \u201CWe've sketched out the design of the TWAMM, but our work is just beginning.\u201D He called for further developers to join them in working on this particular project."],"hashtag":["ETHEREUM","PARADIGM","UNISWAP"]}
