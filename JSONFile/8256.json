Prior to FTX\u2019s collapse, Ellison ran sister trading firm Alameda Research and was at times romantically involved with Bankman-Fried.","<a href=\"https:\/\/storage.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940\/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.176.0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The DOJ filing<\/a>, which came late yesterday, accuses Bankman-Fried of leaking Ellison\u2019s diary to NYT reporters in an attempt to discredit her.","\u201CThe defendant\u2019s purpose in sharing these materials is plain. Ellison has pleaded guilty to a cooperation agreement and is expected to testify at trial that she agreed with the defendant to defraud FTX\u2019s customers and investors, and Alameda\u2019s lenders,\u201D the DOJ wrote.

Kaplan to enforce an order \u201Cthat limits extrajudicial statements by parties and witnesses likely to interfere with a fair trial by an impartial jury.\u201D","The DOJ pointed out that leaks aimed at discrediting witnesses, besides potentially tainting the jury pool, also have the potential to deter other witnesses from testifying.","Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236735\/judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-most-charges-against-sam-bankman-fried\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">faces over 100 years in prison<\/a> if convicted on an array of charges brought against him by U.S. authorities, including fraud-related charges regarding allegations that he and other FTX executives misappropriated billions in customer assets. He is currently under house arrest, with his trial scheduled for October.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
