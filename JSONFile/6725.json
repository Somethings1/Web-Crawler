According to the post on Wednesday, Dish had bought the Blockbuster brand in 2011 for $320 million.","\"They believed it was still worth more than any community like ours would be able to raise,\" it read. \"Our position, to the contrary, was that its value had depreciated considerably since its bankruptcy.\"","R3WIND said that the project had received \"swift and enthusiastic\" support from the community but that it had decided to make sure they could \"deliver on the promise to buy Blockbuster\" before dropping an NFT collection.","According to the post, Dish did not want Blockbuster to be controlled by a DAO. R3WIND then came up with a proposal that would give the DAO 65% ownership of Blockbuster initially. The idea was to create a limited-liability corporation that would progressively become decentralized. R3WIND made a product presentation on May 10, but ultimately the company opted out weeks later.","\"In their exact words, they wanted to be 'in the driver's seat' and 'did not want to license the brand to a DAO,'\" the post read.","R3WIND said it still wants to see the project through, stating that its ambition is \"greater than ever.\" The organization's vision is to have a \"content ecosystem that gives creators more control over their art and their businesses.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
