We also look forward to the Hyperledger community's expertise being leveraged to harden and improve Burrow's EVM and secure native features,\" Byrne said.","Monax is also a member of the recently announced Enterprise Ethereum consortium.","Chick and eggs image via Shutterstock"],"entity":[{"type":"Hyperledger\u2019s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monax","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"IBM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monax COO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Preston Byrne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Byrne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monax","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Intel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Enterprise Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shutterstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hyperledger\u2019s Technical Steering Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Connecticut","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Hyperledger","News","Monax","EVM","Burrow"],"authors":["Garrett Keirns"]}
