He added that bitcoin rose around 20 times from the lows of the bear market to the 2021 peak, meaning that were that to repeat, bitcoin could rise even higher toward the $300,000 mark.","\u201CIt\u2019s hard to put a fine point on these things and also the timing is very difficult. I think broadly we'll get to that place over the next 18 to 24 months and it could be sooner,\u201D he said.","As for the upcoming <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/halving\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin halving<\/a>, Tapiero described it as another fundamental bullish factor on a macro level. \u201CIf you think about the supply being reduced at a time that the demand is exploding based on the ETF, it really points to a lot of upside for bitcoin. And I think bitcoin will drag everything else with it,\u201D he said.","As for Ethereum, Tapiero reckons there\u2019s a pretty good chance that there will be a spot Ethereum ETF as the underlying asset has become established and reached a network effect. However, he is unsure when they will be approved.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_positive\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      +0.36%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> and Ethereum, to me, are the core assets.
