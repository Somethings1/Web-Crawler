Such a system, if functional, would undercut the argument from the crypto industry that digital assets can speed up transactions.&nbsp;","One-time federal banking nominee and current Cornell Law professor Saule Omarova said the new project, known as FedNow, \u201Cwould relieve a lot of the actual market need for faster payments and would eliminate a lot of claims for the use of all of these crypto payments systems.\u201D","Omarova's fellow panelists, including Allen and Stoller, agreed that they wanted FedNow to launch sooner rather than later, saying that the crypto industry had pointed to a legitimate problem of payments access as an advertising point without solving the problem.","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
