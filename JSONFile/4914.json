THORChain enables decentralized exchanges and its users to move assets across blockchains seamlessly. At present there is a little more than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thorchain.live\/thorchain\/chaosnet\/network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$300 million in total value locked<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> (TVL) on its network.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">RUNE was trading at $2.20 according to CoinGecko at the time of writing, having spiked as high as $2.25 on some exchanges earlier in the day. This represents an increase of 11.6% in the past 24 hours, up from $1.97.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The DEX\u2019s native token had fallen below $2 on June 13 as the broader crypto market was in tumult following crypto lending platform Celsius halting withdrawals. Today\u2019s move sees it recover all of its losses from the past 11 days.&nbsp;<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The DEX is the only network currently capable of facilitating decentralized swaps between multiple networks without smart contract capabilities. According to THORChain it does this without compromising security of self-custody.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chad Barraford, technical lead at THORChain, spoke with The Block last week to discuss the move to mainnet. He stressed that, despite the peer-to-peer nature of crypto, most trades take place using a centralized exchange, so the long-term goal for THORChain is to support decentralized, peer-to-peer finance.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">THORChain solves this issue by running liquidity pools between chains. This means it doesn\u2019t depend on wrapping, which is centrally controlled through smart contracts and exposes users to counter-party risk, according to some critics.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The platform currently supports swaps across seven different networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin cash and RUNE, its native token.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, the network has been the victim of several hacks. Notably, a hacker took <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/112308\/thorchain-suffers-8-million-loss-by-hacker-wanting-to-teach-lesson\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$8 million from THORChain<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in July 2021 \u2014 which represented about 8% of the platform's funds at the time.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The move to mainnet may help enhance its security to avoid future attacks. <\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
