Fintech Week, a conference in Washington, DC featuring regulators and industry executives. \u201CIf we\u2019re not careful, that\u2019s not right. If you could not use the the term \u2018stablecoin\u2019 to describe it, how would you describe it?\u201D","Hsu\u2019s remarks echoed concerns raised in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fsb.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/P111022-1.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a report<\/a> released Tuesday morning by the Financial Stability Board, an international organization of central bankers and senior regulators, warning that current stablecoins do not meet the organization's \"high-level recommendations,\" and suggesting the need for authorities to be ready to apply relevant regulations to any stablecoins that could become Global Stablecoin Arrangements (GSCs).","The report was released ahead of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) meeting starting Oct. 13.","\u201CThis concept is useful as shorthand,\u201D Hsu continued, but when it comes to setting consumer expectations of how it\u2019s going to function, he added that, \u201Cnow we\u2019re moving into the world of disguise, and that\u2019s where I get worried.\u201D","Hsu raised the topic of stablecoins when bringing up areas of \u201Csafety, soundness, and fairness,\u201D that he is focused on as a subject of concern.","Still, Hsu said he didn\u2019t want to completely discourage experimentation with financial technology.","\u201CIf the thing that is being discussed or being experimented with is not that big, I, as Acting Comptroller of the Currency, will probably not care that much about it,\u201D said Hsu. \u201CThere\u2019s a materiality threshold which I think provides plenty of space for the experimentation that folks want to do,\u201D and that his agency would get involved only if a project started to violate the safety, soundness and fairness measures he raised as his focus.","Â© 2023 The Block.
