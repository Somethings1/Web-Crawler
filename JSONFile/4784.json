The startup said that as things stand, access to chips, computing power and the models powering AI tools lie in the hands of a small group of companies.","\u201CThe consolidation of AI among a small group of powerful companies poses a significant threat to the future of technology. We founded Ritual to end the ecosystem\u2019s reliance on the few, to open access to this critical infrastructure, and ensure a future of building better AI. Ritual is the decentralized network that the ecosystem needs,\u201D said Niraj Pant, co-founder of Ritual, in a statement.","Ritual is operating in a similar space to Gensyn \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234092\/blockchain-compute-power-gensyn-raise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the blockchain-based marketplace for compute power that raised $43 million in a round led by a16z in June<\/a>.","Founded by Niraj Pant and Akilesh Potti, who spent three years working together at crypto investment firm Polychain Capital, Ritual laid out five key areas of focus: to create its incentivized network that connects distributed computing devices to power hosting, sharing, inference and fine-tuning of AI models; an API layer for access to models; a proof layer that guarantees computational integrity; censorship resistance; and privacy. &nbsp;","The cash injection will be used to build network infrastructure, grow the team of 15 people and to grow the Ritual\u2019s ecosystem.
