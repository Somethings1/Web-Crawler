Revenue per player is going up.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Linden, a video game veteran with years spent at both Activision and Niantic, is in charge of taking Mythical's web3 gaming titles mainstream. NFL Rivals' arcade-style gameplay appears to be catching on with more than 20,000 new players downloading the game each day, he said. Mythical benefits from strong brand recognition as it forged partnerships with both the NFL and the NFL's Players Association. The company has also signed promotional partnerships with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.miamidolphins.com\/news\/nfl-rivals-announce-new-partnership-with-the-miami-dolphins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Miami Dolphins<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gaming.amazon.com\/rivals-booster-pack-oct23\/dp\/amzn1.pg.item.e2ae67e3-f175-4293-af22-32c4df481b55?ingress=amzn\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Amazon Prime Gaming<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So far, although gaming has long been seen as a path toward convincing mainstream consumers to adopt blockchain-enabled computer applications, the sector has struggled to catch on. For a brief time during the pandemic, Axie Infinity was a hit, but the game's popularity then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243458\/top-play-to-earn-tokens-like-axie-infinity-witness-98-drop-in-trading-volume-from-peak\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">eroded significantly<\/a>.<\/span>","NFL Rivals is free to play and utilizes the Mythical's Mythos blockchain.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Both Apple and Google have approved early versions of NFL Rivals' in-game marketplace, which allows players to trade NFTs like official player cards, said Linden.

In total, Linden said NFL Rivals has generated \"millions of dollars\" in revenue since <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247208\/crypto-nfl-game-scores-millions-of-downloads-full-gameplay-going-live\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launching<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> fully in August, just ahead of the football season.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Apple and Google are allowing Mythical to roll out the in-game NFT marketplace in three phases, said Linden, as the companies are keen to protect users. Linden said the first phase allows for players to purchase assets from other players through a \"recommendation engine.\" <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Now Mystical is working on the second phase, which when complete, will allow players to sell game assets in-game through a \"credit system.\" The third phase will involve the entire marketplace going live, he added.<\/span>","Linden admitted that some might argue that NFL Rivals is not a fully web3 game, but he said convincing tech giants like Apple and Google to allow for trading of digital assets minted on the blockchain is a process that will take time.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NFL Rivals' user and revenue growth should come as welcome news to Mythical's long list of investors.
