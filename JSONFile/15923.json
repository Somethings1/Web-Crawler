The last time the metric was around the 49% level happened in July 2021, some 21 months ago, TradingView shows.","ETH dominance, on the other hand, surged to 19.87% on Thursday, marking a one-month high.","The BTC dominance rate is the BTC market capitalization\u2019s share of the total market cap of the cryptocurrency market. The metric is important to assess the relative strength of BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, compared to the broader crypto market, or identify periods when altcoins outperform, also known as an altcoin season. Ether dominance similarly shows the second largest cryptocurrency\u2019s relative value to the crypto market.","Ether\u2019s improved performance has reduced bitcoin\u2019s share of the crypto market. The shift has come after the Ethereum network\u2019s long-awaited tech upgrade, called Shanghai or Shapella, was deployed without a hitch late Wednesday.","The upgrade enabled the withdrawal of more than 17.4 million of staked tokens, worth some $35 billion, from Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake blockchain for the first time since its launch in December 2020. Its successful deployment eliminated a slight but concerning f risk that ETH investors might not be able to reclaim their tokens locked up in staking contracts..","ETH rose as high as $2,023 on Thursday, gaining 5% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data, leading the upswing of the broader crypto prices.","BTC, which also reacted positively to the upgrade, is only up 1.5% through the day, lagging behind altcoins."],"entity":[{"type":"TradingView","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"48.12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"49.06%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"December 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2,023","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"49%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$35 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"July 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"19.87%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Ether","ETH","Ethereum","Bitcoin","Dominance rate","bitcoin dominance","Bitcoin Dominance Rate","Markets","Trading","Investing"],"authors":["Krisztian Sandor"]}
