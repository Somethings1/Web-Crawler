Pinata\u2019s powerful but easy-to-use product allows users to upload, share, and manage files with unmatched speed throughout the IPFS network. One problem that was brought to their attention by their user base was that since IPFS is a public network, it lacks the privacy and security many users need. Through user research and customer feedback, Pinata knew that there were many users in the NFT space that required more protection for their content, without losing the ability to share and display their work anywhere.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An Added Layer of Protection for NFTs<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thus, the introduction of Pinata\u2019s newest feature, Submarining, came in. Submarining will allow users on Pinata\u2019s Professional Plan to turn on and off the submarining feature when they are uploading a file to the platform. If a user does not want the file to be available to the IPFS public network, they can simply turn on \u201CSubmarine\u201D which will hide the information from the network. While the feature is still in beta, the company continues to expand on its offerings for users\u2019 needs. With Submarining, users can now set properties such as who can view the NFT files that are submarined, how long they can view them, and more.

More than 22 million files have been stored on the IPFS network through Pinata, with this number increasing daily. With over 49,000 users already on Pinata, many have upgraded their plans to include the new capabilities and more users continue to join by the day. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CPeople who use Pinata have always been on the leading edge of NFTs.
