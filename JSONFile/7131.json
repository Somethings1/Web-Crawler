From <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/92111\/microstrategy-buys-additional-bitcoin-10-million-btc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Microstrategy<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/80711\/stone-ridge-treasury-bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stone Ridge Holdings<\/a> \u2014 and maybe soon the city of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/91405\/miami-mayor-bitcoin-btc-investment-plan-city-treasury-reserves\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Miami<\/a> \u2014 big players are allocating to the top cryptocurrency.","But as the money flows towards bitcoin adoption, ICO's aren't over, according to Morehead. Pantera is still pitched one every two to four months, and the firm's initial coin offering (ICO) fund <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/91272\/panteras-ico-fund-ends-2020-up-more-than-500-bitcoin-fund-up-nearly-300\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ended 2020<\/a> up more than 500%.&nbsp;","Still, that's a sharp decline from the 50 pitches a week Pantera sifted through in 2017, and its bitcoin fund closed 2020 up nearly 300%. The crypto narrative for investors is trending towards Bitcoin amid institutional adoption, Morehead told The Scoop.","\"We\u2019re really seeing an inflection point with more coming into the market over the last couple of months.... I think the reality is they\u2019re looking for managers that manage multiasset funds sometimes both tokens and venture and they ultimately want that all to be within a handful of managers,\" he said.","Lately, Morehead is fielding calls from endowments, putting the industry at an intriguing inflection point. Driving the interest in bitcoin is the current macro backdrop as well as bitcoin's block reward halving last year\u2014which the firm <a href=\"http:\/\/prod-latest-alb-2062789233.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com\/linked\/91272\/panteras-ico-fund-ends-2020-up-more-than-500-bitcoin-fund-up-nearly-300\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> could play a role in bringing its price to $115,000.&nbsp;","Morehead broke down what that means for the coming year on this week's episode, along with:","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclosure: Pantera was an investor in a past funding round for The Block.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
