He said that any move to approve only the recent wave of applications would \"reflect a positive but sudden and significant change in the Commission\u2019s application of the relevant statutory standard, and as such would improperly grant an unfairly discriminatory and prejudicial first-mover advantage to these proposals.\"","Hall added that any approval, if one comes, should include all previous ones that have been disapproved. He said the company supports a regulatory approval that would facilitate the approval of all spot bitcoin ETF proposals.","\"The Commission has previously questioned the relevance of pricing data produced by what it views as unregulated bitcoin trading venues,\" Hall said, referring to the surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase that have been heralded as a breakthrough in the quest for a spot bitcoin fund.","Coincidentally, SEC Chair Gary Gensler once again expressed skepticism about crypto markets when asked about the pending applications during a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241820\/gensler-raises-concerns-about-fraud-and-manipulation-when-asked-about-bitcoin-etfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">televised interview on Thursday<\/a>.","Earlier this month, Grayscale lawyers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238732\/grayscale-lawyers-criticize-sec-over-leveraged-bitcoin-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">criticized<\/a> the SEC for allowing the first leveraged bitcoin exchange-traded fund while having rejected its previous efforts for a spot fund.","\u201CThe fact that the Commission has allowed a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP to begin trading demonstrates that the Commission continues to arbitrarily treat spot bitcoin ETPs differently than bitcoin futures ETPs,\u201D lawyer Donald Verrilli said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
