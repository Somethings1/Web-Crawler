This source said they have clarified that from government sources.","Earlier today, CNN-News18 reported citing \"sources in the security establishment,\" that the government will not ban crypto after all.","\"A regulation mechanism will be in place so that crypto is not misused,\" the sources told the publication. \"The government is concerned about the underground transactions happening against cryptocurrency \u2014 particularly its role in 'hawala' and terror funding.\"","\"A strict mechanism will be in place so that law enforcement agencies can trace the origin of cryptocurrency used for illegal or anti-national work,\" the sources added.","This is not the first time cryptocurrencies in India are trading at a discount, said CoinSwitch Kuber's Nair. Prices dropped significantly in 2017, when late Arun Jaitley, then India's finance minister, said that the government does not recognize bitcoin as legal tender, said Nair."],"hashtag":["BITCOIN"]}
