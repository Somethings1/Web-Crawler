MoonPay figures its new product, which is&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.moonpay.com\/business\/nfts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">already live<\/a>, could triple sales for NFT sellers while making the checkout process significantly faster.","\u201CRight now, the NFT market is limited to the hundreds of millions of people who own cryptocurrency,\u201D said MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright in a statement. \u201CMoonPay\u2019s NFT Checkout has just opened the door to billions more who own credit cards by making ownership both simple and fast.\u201D","The new checkout tool supports NFT purchases across any blockchain, including Ethereum, Flow, Solana and Polygon. The link between NFTs and their corresponding blockchain is how buyers and sellers keep tabs on ownership. Once purchased with a card using MoonPay, NFTs will be sent directly to a customer\u2019s crypto wallet.","When purchasing an NFT, customers typically incur charges known in crypto parlance as&nbsp;\u2018gas fees.\u2019 Those fees will be baked into the cost of NFTs for users of the checkout tool, except for items linked to more efficient blockchains like Polygon, for which MoonPay will pay the gas fees itself.","The checkout option can be used either for primary or secondary NFT sales. The former involves \u2018minting\u2019 a piece from a new collection, which MoonPay takes care of on behalf of customers.","In terms of charges, MoonPay will levy a processing fee of 3.5% or $3.99 \u2014 whichever is larger \u2014 to the person buying NFTs.&nbsp;","It is already up and running as a payment option for&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wwf-nfa.com\/en\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an NFT collection<\/a>&nbsp;created by the World Wildlife Fund. Several other partners are running pilot versions of the product \u2014 including NFL quarterback Tom Brady\u2019s NFT platform Autograph.","Founded in 2019, as an \u2018on-ramp\u2019 for crypto purchases, MoonPay has quickly amassed more than 250 clients and is active across more than 160 countries. In October 2021, the startup&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/124980\/moonpay-raise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">closed a $555 million fundraise<\/a>&nbsp;that valued it at $3.4 billion.","Recently, MoonPay has taken an active role in NFT markets through&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj9kbC-9dD1AhWc_XMBHabkCgwQFnoECAsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theblockcrypto.com%2Fpost%2F125483%2Fmoonpay-concierge-celebrities-nft&amp;usg=AOvVaw0i7uAAgbHl7hao5cAvnldJ\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the launch of a concierge service<\/a>&nbsp;that helps the rich and famous purchase high-end crypto collectibles. The startup has brokered big-ticket buys for a host of celebrities including Paris Hilton, Jimmy Fallon and Snoop Dogg.","In an email sent to staff this morning announcing the launch of its new checkout tool, Soto-Wright wrote: \u201CNFTs represent the future, not just of our company, but of the entire crypto community. NFTs enable digital ownership of collectibles in the form of art, fashion, music and beyond. The addressable market segment expands dramatically beyond cryptocurrencies as a new form of money.\u201D"],"hashtag":["COINBASE"]}
