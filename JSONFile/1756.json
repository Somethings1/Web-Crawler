For its part FIS understands that while there are significant challenges in adoption of crypto currencies, a large part of the financial marketplace of the future will be conducted on blockchai<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">n. That is why it has aligned with specialist partners in the crypto space \u2013 such as <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto tax and accounting software platform,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ledgible.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Ledgible<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, and enterprise-grade digital asset investing and wallet technology provider <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fisglobal.com\/en\/about-us\/media-room\/press-release\/2022\/fis-teams-with-fireblocks-to-accelerate-crypto-adoption-within-capital-markets-industry-globally\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, in order<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to help accelerate crypto and digital asset adoption capabilities for clients.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cryptocurrencies present several challenges for traditional financial services firms: non-standard naming convention, 24\/7 trading, increasingly complicated transaction types, fragmented liquidity, and variable revenue streams to name a few. Without the proper tools, institutional crypto adoption may feel a little like fitting a square peg into a round hole. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to John Avery, head of digital assets for FIS capital markets, one of the challenges traditional firms face when entering these markets was that it often requires them to use one-off solutions or manual processes to get them up and running. \u201CWhat we learned from our clients was that most want to operate at scale from \u2018Day one\u2019 of operation, not 12 months down the road\u201D.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To support at the required scale, systems ranging from Trading and Risk to Treasury and Accounting will each need to be \u201Ccrypto enabled\u201D \u2013 whether extending decimal precision, messaging into new trading venues, or supporting new concepts like hard forks or airdrops. In addition, those systems will need to connect with the fragmented and constantly evolving world of digital asset liquidity. Only by solving both can traditional financial firms support digital assets using existing technology and operational teams.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To help turn this concept into reality, FIS and Ledgible provide a single, normalized source of post-trade data to capture all that is necessary to properly account for digital assets no matter where a firm chooses to trade. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By using this new source of data for digital assets, firms can easily connect the wide array of centralized exchanges, liquidity providers, Defi protocols, blockchains and custodians in the crypto space into the many downstream accounting and risk platforms that need to consume such information. Combined with a significant FIS investment to support digital assets natively in its core systems, the two firms hope to offer as close to a turn-key solution as possible for their buy and sell side clients moving into crypto and digital assets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Both crypto enthusiasts and more reticent firms do agree on one thing: that the world is still in the initial stages of crypto adoption. Firms looking for new growth opportunities can get an easy head start on the transformation journey \u2013 from day one to full maturity with FIS and Ledgible, we simplify the complex and help accelerate time to market.<\/span>","&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by Ledgible <\/i><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
