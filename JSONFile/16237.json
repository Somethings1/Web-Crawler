Wintermute\u2019s accumulation of ARKM potentially makes them a bigger player in providing liquidity in that ecosystem.","\u201CIt\u2019s super unlikely Wintermute is actually buying the token to hold it [as an investment]. Two potential possibilities are that they are either market-making with those tokens or doing some sort of [over-the-counter] deal they\u2019re helping to facilitate,\u201D said \"Paul,\" a core contributor for crypto options trading protocol Lyra.","After the transactions, Wintemute became the 10th-largest holder of ARKM. The token has slid 5.6% in the past 24 hours to just under 47 cents.","ARKM debuted on July 18 at 75 cents, and the day before, Wintemute received about 15 million tokens from the Arkham Intelligence Multisig wallet, which makes sense for market making, according to Paul.","\u201CYou generally want to distribute to market makers prior to lauch so you launch with deep markets, otherwise the token price would be super volatile,\u201D Paul said.","Representatives of Arkham Intelligence did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment by press time. Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy said to CoinDesk over X (formerly Twitter) that he couldn\u2019t provide any comment.","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"Arkham Intel Exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"75 cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"5.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Wintemute","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wintermute","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Arkham Intelligence Multisig","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"731%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Evgeny Gaevoy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lyra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Arkham Intelligence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nansen","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Paul","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\"Paul","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$3.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"July 18","content":"DATE"},{"type":"47 cents","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Wintermute","Arkham intelligence","On-Chain Analysis","Nansen"],"authors":["Sage D.
