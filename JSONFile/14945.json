{"summary":"He did incalculable harm, but arguing for a sentence longer than 25 years is unfair to the man and the industry he once represented.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/consensus-magazine\/2024\/03\/28\/sam-bankman-fried-deserves-a-life-after-prison\/","publishDate":"2024-03-28T16:49:30","id":14945,"type":null,"title":"Sam Bankman-Fried Deserves a Life After Prison","category":["Consensus Magazine"],"content":["It is patently absurd that Sam Bankman-Fried asked to receive no more than 6.5 years for what could be appropriately described as the crime of the century. It is also laughable that, in arguing for a lighter sentence, his newly hired defense counsel made appeals to SBF\u2019s autism and veganism, and made hay of the full restitution his victims are likely to receive. A man\u2019s diet is not a basis for leniency, and moreso, the FTX estate was able recover some, but not all, of the billions of dollars worth of missing assets, not because of Bankman-Fried\u2019s help, but in spite of it.","This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond.

Ray III, who is overseeing the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy process, wrote in a March 20 memo. \"The harm was vast. The remorse is nonexistent.\"","Yet, to serve Sam Bankman-Fried with what would amount to a virtual life sentence would also have been insane. According to U.S. sentencing guidelines, Bankman-Fried faced up to 110 years in prison. The Department of Justice prosecutors who tried the case sought a 40-50 year sentence for SBF\u2019s guilt in two counts of fraud and five counts of conspiracy. As Judge Lewis Kaplan said, \u201Cthat would be more than necessary,\u201D as he handed down a 25-year sentence.","Public opinion on the matter (such as it is) appears split, with many saying the sentence is too lenient. SBF will need to serve at least 85% of the 25 years, meaning the 32-year-old could walk in his early 50s. SBF violated the trust of his investors, customers and own employees. Dozens of victim statements speak to the shock and financial distress he caused, and the countless lives he threw off course. Judge Kaplan also ruled SBF attempted to obstruct justice, and perjured himself three times.","And yet, as the verdict is handed down today, the crypto industry might do well to wish SBF well. Putting aside the grisly statistics and realities of life in federal penitentiaries \u2014 including that the United States incarcerates five times more people per capita than most other countries, and the racial disparity in criminal justice \u2014 robbing SBF of his entire life for a non-violent crime would have been unconscionable. This is likely an unpopular opinion, given the harm SBF has caused to many crypto holders and the industry at large.","There is no point in arguing SBF\u2019s guilt; whether or not he intended to deceive the world is moot. Significant harm was done. There is also no reason to believe SBF\u2019s arguments that he could help clients better than the highly-paid bankruptcy lawyers currently doing that job. It\u2019s clear SBF made no attempt to protect or recover clients\u2019 funds until after the fraud was exposed. Likewise, there is no point in trying to answer the question of whether SBF, motivated by utilitarian aims of doing the most good in the world, turned bad or started that way.","There is also almost no viable defense of SBF that could be made. The dozens of character witnesses in his favor who painted a picture of a smart kid who got in over his head, or who is too sweet for hard prison life, are largely unconvincing. Barbara Fried, SBF\u2019s mother, wrote that Sam is an \u201Cangel of mercy\u201D who carries the pain of the world in his depressed mind, without any reference to his victims. And his charitable works don't count for anything; it's easy to give away other peoples\u2019 money.","But wishing for someone to be locked up for decades \u2014 to never again have the opportunity to redeem themselves or make an attempt to do right is odd. Incarceration serves a few purposes: retribution for harms done to society, deterrence for others to commit similar crimes and as a matter of public safety. The prosecutors tried to argue there was a \u201Csignificant likelihood\u201D Bankman-Fried would commit more crimes upon release, asking for him to be locked up into his 80s.","See also: Lyn Ulbricht \u2014 Put America's Geeks to Work, Don't Cage Them | Opinion","Prison can also serve another purpose: reform. Although SBF\u2019s lawyer Marc Mukasey told the judge that the FTX founder wasn\u2019t a \u201Cruthless financial serial killer\u201D who set out to rob his customers, only a mind-reader could say for certain what his intentions were. It\u2019s clear enough that SBF began dipping from customer accounts within a year of spinning up the FTX futures exchange and has expressed little remorse for his crimes. But, as human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith said: \u201CNever judge a person only by their worst action.\u201D","Demonizing SBF, sometimes called the \u201Cface of crypto,\u201D is in effect a demonization of crypto in general. Crypto fans should hope that SBF is reformed and feels remorse in time, in the same way the industry itself should work to rid itself of fraud. I cannot comment on whether SBF\u2019s effective altruism was ever sincere, but I want to believe there is the possibility of goodness in him, in the same way that crypto supporters believe that crypto can affect good in the world, despite its detractors.","In short: SBF deserves a life after prison.","CORRECTION (MARCH 28, 2024): Fixes age at which Sam Bankman-Fried could exit prison.","Edited by Benjamin Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"Marc Mukasey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Benjamin Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Barbara Fried","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Clive Stafford Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"85%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Put America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"hundreds of millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"50","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"John J.
