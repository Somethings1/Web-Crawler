Its Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) offloaded 44,784 shares, and Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) sold 76,788 shares.

The ruling is favorable for Coinbase since it may affect the 13 tokens actively traded on Coinbase that the SEC alleged are securities in its lawsuit against the company last month, according to experts, including Wood and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239775\/jpmorgan-ripple-xrp-coinbase\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JPMorgan analysts.<\/a>","The ruling has resulted in a significant surge in Coinbase's price, with it currently trading close to its highest level in the past year. The shares have also rallied because Coinbase was listed as a surveillance-sharing partner for several spot bitcoin ETF applicants, including giants BlackRock and Fidelity.","While Ark is selling some Coinbase shares, it is still the second-largest owner, with more than a 6% stake, according to CNN <a href=\"https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/quote\/shareholders\/shareholders.html?symb=COIN&amp;subView=institutional\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a>.","Â© 2023 The Block.
