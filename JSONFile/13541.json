As such, the conclusions here are based on observations from our small sample size. So please do take them with a grain of salt.<\/em>","Last night <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block<\/em> ran an experiment comparing the prediction markets results of PredictIt and Augur alongside the opinion poll analyses of <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FiveThirtyEight<\/em> during the 2018 U.S. Midterm Elections. We updated the results on an hourly basis from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. EST. The following is what we observed.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FiveThirtyEight<\/em>, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alexa.com\/siteinfo\/fivethirtyeight.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.alexa.com\/siteinfo\/fivethirtyeight.com\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">one of the most popular poll-analytics sites<\/a>, did not release election results <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/close%20at%206%20p.m.%20Eastern\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"http:\/\/close at 6 p.m. Eastern\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">until 6 p.m. EST<\/a> when the first polling places began to close. Prior to&nbsp;<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FiveThirtyEight\u2019s<\/em>&nbsp;updated models with actual results, forecasts on Augur and PredictIt for U.S. House control were relatively flat \u2014 <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/11\/06\/politics\/the-final-forecast-2018-election\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/11\/06\/politics\/the-final-forecast-2018-election\/index.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reflecting the consensus<\/a> of the Democrats taking control. However, after <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FiveThirtyEight<\/em> started reporting polling results, both Augur and PredictIt became widely volatile \u2014 appearing to track <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FiveThirtyEight\u2019s<\/em> data in real-time.","As an example, at 9 p.m., <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FiveThirtyEight<\/em> drastically decreased the chances of Democrats winning the House and the prediction markets on Augur and PredictIt quickly followed suit. The trend where&nbsp;<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FiveThirtyEight<\/em> acted as a leading indicator continued until the end of our experiment. While prediction markets are supposed to leverage the power of \u201Cwisdom of the crowd\u201D to make highly accurate predictions, it appears that yesterday night, the smart money was tracking the poll results of one website.","The <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/predictions.global\/augur-markets\/which-party-will-control-the-house-after-2018-u-s-midterm-election-0xbbbc0a8baa03535e0a680ee2f057162aaaafd570\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/predictions.global\/augur-markets\/which-party-will-control-the-house-after-2018-u-s-midterm-election-0xbbbc0a8baa03535e0a680ee2f057162aaaafd570\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">House forecast market on Augur<\/a> was a relative success \u2014 $1.6M in ether was placed by approximately 360 participants.

A lack of liquidity\/interest explains why estimates on Augur were flat from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., even as the estimates of a Republican victory continue to increase throughout the night.","We were able to see the use case of Augur in action last night. Users were able to bet over $1 million on the results of a major event. However, while the House forecast might be considered a minor success given the newness of the Augur platform, there's still a long way to go.
