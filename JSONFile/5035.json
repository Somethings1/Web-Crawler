A spokesperson for PleasrDAO declined to comment.&nbsp;","The group \u2014 a decentralized autonomous organization or DAO \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/decrypt.co\/63080\/an-ad-for-uniswap-just-sold-for-525000-as-an-nft-heres-why\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">was formed in March 2021<\/a>, when its members put $525,000 towards the purchase of an animated Uniswap ad in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT). The ad, created by artist pplpleasr, depicts a pink unicorn making its way towards an Ethereum logo-cradling oasis.","Since then, PleasrDAO has collected other big-ticket items \u2014 all linked to what it describes as \u201Cculturally significant\u201D ideas and causes, <a href=\"https:\/\/pleasr.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to its website<\/a>.","\u201CDubbed as an art collecting empire, the DAO is experimenting with novel concepts in digital and community art ownership,\u201D reads a statement on PleasrDAO\u2019s site. \u201CIts members are exploring ideas such as fractionalizing iconic pieces to be distributed to, and owned by, the community.\u201D","The group has already splashed $4 million on an NFT of the image that inspired Dogecoin; $5.4 million on a piece by Edward Snowden; and $4 million on a rare Wu-Tang Clan album.","Its members include dozens of DeFi founders, NFT collectors and digital artists. In December, venture capital firm a16z <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/14\/andreessen-horowitz-backs-nft-investor-group-behind-one-of-a-kind-wu-tang-clan-album-purchase\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced an investment<\/a> in the group. The company did not disclose the size of its investment, but TechCrunch reported that it held less than 5% of the DAO\u2019s governance tokens.","The document obtained by The Block also suggests that PleasrDAO\u2019s reserves will grow from 7,895 ETH to (roughly $18.8 million at current prices) this month to 27,725 ETH (around $66 million) by February, while its USDC stockpile will increase from a negligible sum to $3 million.","It\u2019s unclear exactly how this is connected, if at all, to the fundraise \u2014 as the group\u2019s total assets are only expected to grow from $83.6 million to $153.6 million (an increase of $70 million) after the deal has closed.","The same document indicates that 11 people currently work for PleasrDAO \u2014 a headcount that will more than double to 28 by the third quarter of next year.","Â© 2023 The Block.
