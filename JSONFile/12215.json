This trade provides a dollar gain that can be realized at expiry regardless of bitcoin's fluctuating value.","Strijers said that the disparity between the spot price of bitcoin and its futures price reflects the growing market momentum since the approval of ETFs in January and the expectations regarding the impact of the bitcoin halving.","\"The fact that this yield is so incredibly high is a very bullish indicator and driven by the daily new money flowing into the system because of the spot bitcoin ETF approval and the expected impact of the bitcoin halving,\" he said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A chart showing the increasing bitcoin annualized futures basis. Image: Deribit.<\/span>","In the bitcoin options market, Strijers noted an increased number of outstanding calls compared to puts leading up to the end of March expiry.","\"Overall the put-call ratio for bitcoin is now 0.59, so six puts for every ten calls, while moving further out, for June this drops to 0.32. So only three puts for every ten calls,\" Strijers told The Block. This ratio, which suggests a higher preference for calls over puts in the bitcoin options market, can indicate that bullish sentiment still dominates among derivatives traders.","A put-call options ratio below one indicates that the call volume exceeds the put volume. It is assumed that a trader who buys call options is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/options\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's Data Dashboard<\/a>, today's bitcoin put-call ratio is 0.58 on Deribit, which has about 90% of all bitcoin options open interest.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/options\/btc-put-call-ratio\/embed\" title=\"BTC Put\/Call Ratio\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin pulled back from a new all-time high of above $73,000, which was posted in early-day trading on Thursday.","Over the past day, the price correction led to a substantial liquidation of long positions on centralized exchanges.
