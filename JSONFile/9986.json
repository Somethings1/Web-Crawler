Sort of.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/JaMJi1_1tkA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">epic rap battle<\/a>\u201D produced by San Francisco venture capitalist firm Greylock pits the founding father and his centralized bank against the anonymous founder of decentralized currency, Satoshi Nakamoto. The billion-dollar venture capital firm is hoping humor and catchy bars will help demystify crypto and push the dialogue surrounding digital assets to the forefront.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Greylock released the video today in partnership with the YouTube channel <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCPLbrQwxaDanwzK0MPa5KFQ\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rhyme Combinator<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> which produces comedic rap battles. Over the course of the six-minute video, the Hamilton and Satoshi antagonize each other with common arguments against centralized and decentralized money while an audience of high profile crypto players observes. Faces like Zooko Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn, CEO of ZCash, Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and Wences Casares, CEO of Xapo, among others, grimace as Hamilton makes his case.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the crowd is Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, partner at Greylock, and executive producer of the video. The rap battle was Hoffman\u2019s brainchild, inspired by the Tony-winning musical Hamilton to blend crypto and hip-hop. Greylock has made investments in the crypto space, but Hoffman says this latest project is an investment in the dialogue surrounding crypto, to limit the ad hominem attacks and enable more informed discussion between bankers and crypto players. Many people who are less crypto literate are concerned with its use for criminal activity, its voracious energy consumption, and envision eccentric tech geniuses utilizing it for malicious purposes, according to Hoffman.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"There needs to be a discourse about the vision for the future, not who has the ball, or this is a duel between them,\u201D he said. \u201CWe need to be thoughtful about the great futures we could make. There are competing notions of the futures, but let's create a discourse around that.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ironically, a duel with pithy comebacks to the common concerns may be just what society needs to understand centralization and decentralization. The video comes complete with a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/reidhoffman\/status\/1169276204924301312?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter poll <\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">from Hoffman asking viewers to vote on who won \u2013 Satoshi reigned supreme. Indeed, Hoffman is credited as a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/genius.com\/Reid-hoffman-bitcoin-rap-battle-debate-hamilton-vs-satoshi-lyrics?utm_campaign=Bitcoin%20Rap%20Battle%20Debate&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_content=lyrics&amp;utm_term\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">writer<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> of the track, and Satoshi spends much of the battle refuting the power of central banks before turning to crypto\u2019s pros.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite the classic rap battle structure, Hoffman hopes there isn\u2019t a mic drop, but that the dialogue continues, especially in the regulatory arena. He led the Xapo investment for Greylock, and personally invests in Blockstream as well as holding bitcoin. Key investments are hopefully good for society and good for the world, according to Hoffman.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAll of those investments passed a hurdle,\u201D he said. \u201CWhen you get to regulation, this is an additional risky factor. You are hoping you can get regulation to align with the shape of why you think your investment is not just a good for customers, not just good business, but also good for society.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hoffman pointed to the regulatory conversations surrounding Facebook\u2019s Libra. After two congressional hearings and multiple open letters and comments from government officials across the world, he said the dialogue so far wasn\u2019t as promising for the future of crypto conversations.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe messaging around the Libra launch didn\u2019t go the way I would hope for the crypto ecosystem...it is a good thing to have stablecoins that are in dialogue with the regulators,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While a rap battle between Facebook\u2019s David Marcus and Congress\u2019s Maxine Waters doesn\u2019t seem to be on the horizon, the conversations surrounding Libra and crypto regulation are ongoing.<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that Greylock had invested in Proof of Capital.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
