According to Nebulous, \"As reflected in the settled order, the SEC did not take any enforcement action with respect to the Siacoin token or any current activity on the Sia network, and the order does not require Nebulous to register the Siacoin token as a security with the SEC.\"","In a statement sent to The Block, Zach Herbert, Nebulous' COO, said \"While disappointed that the SEC chose to pursue a steep penalty of almost double what we raised in our 2014 offering of Siafunds, especially compared to their lax handling of EOS, we view this settlement as highly positive for Sia. By choosing not to take action against Siacoins, we believe the SEC has validated Sia\u2019s two-token model. We will continue to build and improve the Sia network at a rapid pace.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
