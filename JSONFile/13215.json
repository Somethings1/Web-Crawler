In this case, 7.5% of the supply will go to previous dYdX users. Token allocations are to take place over a five-year period.","The launch is a notable one, coming from a major decentralized finance structure. In a sense, it follows in the footsteps of projects such as Uniswap (UNI) and Compound (COMP), both of which have decentralized their governance structures through the retroactive airdropping of tokens to their userbase.","The governance token will be used to decide the future direction of the protocol, and token holders will be able to vote on proposals to add new features.
