He noted that, although he loves the U.S. legal system, he thinks it provides would-be criminals with a roadmap to pull off future crimes, via affidavits. Cybercriminals, in turn, study investigative documentation and make adjustments to leave fewer traces as they exploit fringe cases, where projects are maximally exposed to a number of risks.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the good uses of cryptocurrency have increased over the past decade, according to Edman, beneath this layer lies a network of criminal activity that persists in darknet markets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CYou have to have a very good understanding of the fundamentals of the technology, and that understanding has to evolve with the criminal,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Naxo, which says it is focused on cryptocurrency and serves a number of unnamed government entities, says its approach accounts for multiple needs, ranging from raising education levels around crypto-related human risk factors, to technical network layer factors such as proper deployment and peer review of smart contracts source-code, and protections for cryptographic keys.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the context of losses in an industry that can see as much as a billion dollars wiped out by hackers or protocol bugs, Tarbell said that developers would be \u201Ccrazy\u201D not to take a security conscious approach.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Naxo is entering a crowded field.
