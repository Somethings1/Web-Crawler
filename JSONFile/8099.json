Platt will work closely with FTX\u2019s head of environmental and social initiatives Gisele Bündchen.","The hire represents one of a number of expansion avenues for FTX. Earlier this week, The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/134879\/crypto-exchange-ftx-us-gaming-unit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that the exchange launched a new gaming division","With Platt, FTX plans to capitalize on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/study\/61582\/in-depth-luxury\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$300 billion<\/a> luxury goods market, which is estimated to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/personal-luxury-goods-market-size-to-grow-by-usd-33-53-billion-and-accelerate-at-a-cagr-of-over-2-59technavio-301465771.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">grow<\/a> by almost $34 billion by 2025. Fashion and beauty brands have been increasingly getting into the crypto space as the pandemic has forced people out of brick-and-mortar stores and into online and digital experiences. In February alone, many brands filed for metaverse-related trademarks, including Victoria's Secret, Urban Decay, L'Oreal, Kiehl's, Pink, and Dermablend.&nbsp;","\"Only 7% of women are investing in cryptocurrency, and that not only has financial implications but long-term societal effects,\" <span class=\"xn-person\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Platt said in a statement<\/span>. \"Only 9% of women feel they understand crypto, and this means that the majority of women are being left behind from one of the most important opportunities for wealth creation of our generation. To achieve true gender equality, we must invite women to the conversation and provide the tools they need to lay claim to crypto's ascension.\"","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","© 2023 The Block.
