It was projected to fail mere hours before the deadline, but a late surge of votes and some reversals from validators swung the outcome narrowly in favor.","The proposal argued that Atom's high inflation rate, relative to its peers, represented overpayment by the Hub for security. It further reasoned that validators would still be able to break even or turn a profit under 10% inflation.","Zero Knowledge Validator, which cast the largest vote in favor of the proposal, explained its support for the proposal in a <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/ZKValidator\/status\/1725476238297268609?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">post<\/a> on X. \"Double digit inflation is not necessary for security, weakens Atom price long term, and disincentivizes use of Atom in DeFi and elsewhere in the Atom Economic Zone,\" it said.","The largest vote against came from validator AllNodes, which explained in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Allnodes\/status\/1726222965258551684\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">post<\/a> on X that small validators could be hurt by the change.
