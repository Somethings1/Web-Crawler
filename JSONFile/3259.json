Meanwhile,&nbsp;Bitcoin has gained 5% over the last month. That's a reversal of market dynamics from earlier in the year.","Another tailwind for digital assets, in Cumberland's view, is a waning of geo-political disruptions, namely the Russia-Ukraine conflict and supply chain bottlenecks.&nbsp;","The firm also highlighted the possibility of a more favorable environment in Washington, DC in the event of a Republican sweep in tomorrow's midterm elections.&nbsp;","Crypto adoption among large technology companies is also a factor.&nbsp;Instagram, for instance, said last week that it would leverage the Polygon network for its upcoming NFT minting feature in its app. Meanwhile, Google Cloud became a validator of the Solana network.","\"The impact of this has yet to be felt, but as we\u2019ve seen from previous cycles, strong adoption narratives can lead to parabolic rallies,\" the firm said.&nbsp; \"Thus, the current risk\/reward feels meaningfully asymmetric.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
