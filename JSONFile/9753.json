He\u2019ll trade in his laptop for a new, heavily monitored model that\u2019s been customized to only allow access to certain websites. Approved sites include his lawyers\u2019 website, Uber Eats and Spotify.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","An avid gamer before his arrest, Bankman-Fried will also be banned from using video games that permit chat or voice communication.","\u201CHe's under an electronic microscope at full magnification,\u201D said Anthony Sabino, a law professor at St. John's University. \u201CThat is in essence the government constructing a Faraday box around SBF to cut off all electronic means of communication.\u201D","A \"Faraday cage\" is an enclosure that doesn't allow the entry or exit of electromagnetic fields. The bail conditions are a significant shift for the disgraced crypto boss, who was extremely active online before \u2014 and even after \u2014 his crypto exchange collapsed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers asked a judge to delay the new rules until Tuesday because they are waiting for his new devices to arrive. A Bankman-Fried spokesperson did not comment on whether the former billionaire is still using the wider internet, a smartphone or video games in the days before his new bail conditions are put in place.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Although Bankmkan-Fried\u2019s new bail restrictions are still pending, experts doubt he is taking much advantage of the delay. Bankman-Fried\u2019s soon-to-be-implemented bail terms are certainly stricter, but the government has already been tracking his every move.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CThe leash is very short. Any further breaches of bail conditions likely will land Bankman-Fried in jail pending trial,\u201D said Jacob Frenkel, an attorney at the law firm Dickinson Wright.","Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to a litany of criminal charges in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, including bank fraud. He\u2019s awaiting an October trial. The former crypto mogul has been under house arrest at his parents\u2019 California home on a $250 million bond since December.","Prosecutors sought tighter bail conditions after Bankman-Fried contacted a potential witness in his criminal case using an encrypted messaging app, and used a virtual private network to access the internet. A federal judge approved stricter bail terms in a 10-page court order last month.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Charlie Shrem, who was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-sdny\/pr\/former-ceo-bitcoin-exchange-company-sentenced-manhattan-federal-court-two-years-prison\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sentenced<\/a> to two years in prison for his involvement in the black-market trading of bitcoin, called being under house arrest \"devastating.\" Shrem pleaded guilty to transmitting nearly $1 million in bitcoins intended to facilitate drug trafficking on the \u201CSilk Road\" black market in 2014, and serve a year in prison.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\"House arrest is devastating, it\u2019s almost worse than prison. Like Sam, I had an ankle bracelet and was confined to my parents\u2019 house. When you are that young and facing decades behind bars, you stop caring about things,\" said Shrem, who is now a general partner at the venture fund Druid Ventures.","As part of the new rules, Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, will also be subject to strict device monitoring. Their electronic devices must be password protected and outfitted with monitoring software that will photograph the device\u2019s user every five minutes, according to the bail order.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Bankman-Fried will also be required to notify his lawyers before anyone visits him. His home security system must preserve video footage of everyone who enters the residence. Plus, a security guard will screen visitors with a metal detector and take any electronic devices for the duration of the visit. Sabino compared the new protocol to getting on an airplane.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CYou might as well farm this out to TSA,\u201D Sabino said. \u201CThey\u2019re on red alert in terms of watching everything this guy is doing.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
