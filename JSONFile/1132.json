DCG is an existing investor in Circle.&nbsp;","Circle has long touted the use-cases of its dollar-pegged USDC, which span decentralized finance, derivatives trading and e-commerce payments. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, said Genesis Global Trading has been a leading force in the development of the crypto lending space, and a partnership with the company will aid Circle in building out products and services for firms in the burgeoning corner of the crypto market.","Trading firms can use USDC to move more quickly between crypto assets, and users of both centralized and decentralized lending platforms can earn a yield on their USDC holdings.&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b>\"I think the really critical thing here is that the rapid growth and evolution in USDC borrowing and lending, which is really key,\" said Allaire. \"And that's accelerated right alongside the nearly two hundred percent growth in USDC circulation that's happened over the last six months as well.\"","Earlier this year, &nbsp;the Boston-based firm announced Circle Business Account, a toolbox of APIs to allow developers to build on top of USDC.","","","USDC supply has seen a 125% increase year-to-date, and has jumped 162% in the past six months, according to Coin Metrics.&nbsp;","Still, the market is competitive.
