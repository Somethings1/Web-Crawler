Coins like ZEC and ZEN have opt-in privacy features.&nbsp;","When asked why Elliptic added support for ZEN since volumes are low in that counter, Robinson said both Zcash and ZEN are built on the Bitcoin architecture, which made the process easier.","The support for ZEC and ZEN has been added to Elliptic Navigator, the firm\u2019s transaction screening tool, and Elliptic Lens, its wallet screening tool, Robinson told The Block. Crypto trading and lending platform Genesis will be an immediate user of the new program, said Elliptic.","The firm's support of privacy coins comes within days of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/67653\/chainalysis-zcash-dash-compliance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">similar move<\/a> by rival Chainalysis, which added support for Zcash and Dash. Robinson told The Block that rival products that offer Zcash support have focused on providing \"manual investigations capabilities,\u201D whereas Elliptic\u2019s products are designed to \u201Chelp automate the compliance process and help crypto businesses save time and money.\u201D","Privacy coins have been under regulatory scrutiny lately and several exchanges <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/39724\/okex-korea-delisting-all-privacy-coins-including-monero-zcash-and-dash-as-these-violate-fatfs-travel-rule\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">moved to delist them<\/a>, including OKEx Korea, Upbit and CEX.io. But regulators shouldn\u2019t consider privacy coins having any higher risk than bitcoin, Robinson told The Block.","\u201CEnhanced privacy can be achieved in both bitcoin (mixers, coinjoins) and Zcash (shielded addresses),\u201D said Robinson, adding that Zcash, in fact, has been seen to be used \"to a far lesser extent than bitcoin in illicit commerce.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\"Bitcoin remains the crypto-asset of choice for criminals, due to the ease with which it can be acquired and converted back into fiat currency,\" said Robinson.","Â© 2023 The Block.
