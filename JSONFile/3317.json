However, the judge did decide to dismiss the SEC's claim that Coinbase acted as an unregistered broker when it made its Wallet application available to its customers, according to an order filed on Wednesday.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase was sued by the SEC last year for allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange, broker and clearing agency. The regulator also took issue with Coinbase's staking and wallet services.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase has pushed back on the SEC's claims, arguing for the case to be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243128\/coinbase-plans-friday-filing-to-seek-dismissal-of-secs-case-in-its-entirety\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dismissed<\/span><\/a> and accusing the regulator of taking a \"regulation by enforcement approach.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Next, the case proceeds to trial and will be presented to a jury, though the process wouldn't likely start until 2025. <\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC and Coinbase also have to submit a proposed case management plan before April 19.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Today, the Court decided that our SEC case will move forward on most of the claims, but dismissed the claims against Coinbase Wallet,\" said Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/iampaulgrewal\/status\/1772993916146479193\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wednesday<\/span><\/a> on X. \"We were prepared for this, and we look forward to uncovering more about the SEC\u2019s internal views and discussions on crypto regulation.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC \"plausibly alleges\" that some crypto transactions on Coinbase's platform and through Prime were investment contracts, Judge Failla said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Throughout the order, the judge pointed to several key crypto cases, including Terraform where a judge <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/269579\/new-york-judge-grants-sec-summary-judgement-over-claim-that-terraform-sold-unregistered-securities\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sided<\/span><\/a> with the SEC in its claim that the company offered and sold unregistered securities.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Several teachings can be gleaned from these thoughtful decisions,\" Failla said on Wednesday. \"To begin, there need not be a formal contract between transacting parties for an investment contract to exist under Howey.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Howey, referring to the Howey Test, is based on a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case frequently cited by the SEC, to determine if an asset qualifies as an investment contract and, therefore, a security. The test says an asset has to have three components \u2014&nbsp; an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Taking each in turn, the Court concludes that the SEC has adequately alleged that purchasers of certain crypto-assets on the Coinbase Platform and through Prime invested in a common enterprise and were led to expect profits solely from the efforts of others, thereby satisfying the Howey test for an investment contract,\" the judge said.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Since 2017, retail and institutional customers can access a self-custodial wallet, called Coinbase Wallet. The SEC had alleged that Coinbase was acting as an unregistered broker through that service.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Judge Failla said on Wednesday that wasn't so and said the SEC fell short of showing that Coinbase acted as a broker. The SEC did not say that the Wallet negotiates terms, makes investment recommendations, and said instead that Coinbase charged a one percent commission. The commission does not turn Coinbase into a broker, Judge Failla wrote.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"In sum, even when considered in the aggregate, the factual allegations concerning Wallet are insufficient to support the plausible inference that Coinbase 'engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others' through its Wallet application,\" Failla said.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase had argued that the major questions doctrine applied to the case. The doctrine says that if an agency, like the SEC, wants to decide on an issue that has major national significance, it has to be supported by clear congressional authorization. <\/span><span class=\"s5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The major questions doctrine has two parts \u2014 one focused on whether the subject has a major impact on the nation\u2019s economy or the public, and the second is whether a federal agency has explicit authority to implement new regulations.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Judge Failla wasn't convinced.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"First, while certainly sizable and important, the cryptocurrency industry 'falls far short of being a \u2018portion of the American economy\u2019 bearing \u2018vast economic and political significance,\u2019\u201D they said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase had also argued that the SEC violated due process by bringing forward charges without first giving \"fair notice.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"In support of their argument, Defendants make much hay out of a position taken by SEC Chair Gary Gensler in his May 2021 Congressional testimony, in which he suggested that 'only Congress' could address any gap in the SEC\u2019s ability to regulate crypto-exchanges,\" Failla said. \"Yet an examination of the broader timeline of the SEC\u2019s positions regarding cryptoassets reveals that the SEC provided Coinbase (and similarly situated actors) fair notice \u2014 through written guidance, litigation, and other actions \u2014 that the sale or offering of certain crypto-assets could prompt an enforcement action by the SEC.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated<\/i><\/b><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> (March 27, 4:12 p.m. UTC): Added details throughout.<\/i><\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
