While we know some basic details about their contributions to the app,&nbsp; it hasn\u2019t always been exactly clear how they have fit together or who else might be involved. Also, the companies involved in the initial stages of the project have said little \u2014 or in some cases, nothing \u2014 about the specific problems that many Chivo users have reported.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Now, El Salvador has added two more companies to the roster: New York-based software company AlphaPoint and Los Angeles-based digital identity provider Netki. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Here\u2019s how those two firms say they intend to improve the app.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to a press release, AlphaPoint now \u201Csupports the front-end and back-end infrastructure that powers the wallet and integrates the entire ecosystem including the mobile application, mobile point-of-sale processing, merchant website portal, call-center support software, and administrative console.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COur actual application went into production in mid-December,\u201D AlphaPoint CEO Igor Telyatnikov told The Block. He noted that the company was also \u201Cinvolved in the early discussions\u201D with the El Salvador government, and first built a prototype last summer after El Salvador\u2019s president Nayib Bukele first announced a plan to make Bitcoin legal tender last June.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AlphaPoint has operated in the crypto space since June 2013, and has worked with more than 150 crypto exchanges, brokerages and wallets in more than 35 countries. Chivo marks the company\u2019s first government contract.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CTechnology-wise, AlphaPoint technology at its core is a centralized system with a database, but it interoperates with Bitcoin and Lightning [Network] and the banking system,\u201D <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Telyatnikov said. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For Chivo, \u201Cthere\u2019s an upgraded Lightning integration.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Previously, a firm called Athena Bitcoin, known for its Bitcoin ATMs, confirmed it was responsible for developing Chivo. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe Chivo app was developed by Athena,\u201D CEO Eric Gravengaard told The Block in November, without giving many more details. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the time Gravengaard acknowledged the early bugs with Chivo, saying: \u201CThere were some issues and our team has been hard at work on those.\u201D But in January, Athena directed questions about more recent issues to Chivo S.A. \u2014 the company it said is in charge of the wallet's \"<\/span>usage, technical direction, and management.\"<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s also unclear to what extent Athena is still working on the project \u2014 and to what extent AlphaPoint has taken over for Athena, if at all. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/124816\/the-startup-behind-el-salvadors-bitcoin-wallets-is-taking-the-product-global\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">200 Chivo ATMs that Athena owns and operates<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> are still functioning around the country, the company did not respond to follow-up questions on January 26 confirming its current role in Chivo.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One of the biggest complaints about Chivo has been identity theft. There have been many reports of people fraudulently using identification numbers to claim the $30 Bitcoin bonus for creating an account. At least hundreds of people have reported identity theft related to the app.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In October, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2021\/10\/29\/identity-thieves-exploit-el-salvadors-chivo-bitcoin-wallets-setup-process\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reports surfaced on social media<\/a> claiming that people were apparently bypassing Chivo\u2019s verification process, using methods like showing a photocopy of an ID instead of a real one or taking a selfie of a movie poster character instead of a real face.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Presumably, that is why Chivo has brought in a new contributor that specializes in fraud prevention. On January 18, Los Angeles-based digital identity expert Netki <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20220118005185\/en\/Chivo-Wallet-Identification-Verification-Partner-Netki-Successfully-Onboards-4-million-users-in-45-days-to-Facilitate-El-Salvador%E2%80%99s-Official-Bitcoin-Adoption\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced that it had joined<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> the Chivo project and is providing its know-your-customer\/anti-money-laundering (KYC\/AML) product OnboardID to verify users and protect the app against fraud.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CNetki confirmed over 4 million authentic accounts, and we have successfully identified and blocked attempted fraud,\u201D Netki founder and COO Dawn Newton told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Newton said Netki joined the Chivo project \u201Crecently\u201D after its initial launch, but did not clarify the specific date. She did not confirm what the current verification process for Chivo looks like, but said the company\u2019s technology uses \u201Cbiometrics, liveness, computer vision document analysis, and data validation\u201D to verify the documents and individuals.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe then perform sanctions, watchlist, and adverse media screening. These technologies are combined with traditional internet security, bot, and other fraud detection techniques to take a more complete view of the onboarding process than simply analyzing a static image.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Newton, Netki was aware of the fraud reports before the company\u2019s software was fully deployed in Chivo.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhen faced with the challenge of onboarding the better part of a country\u2019s population \u2014 as Chivo was \u2014 attempted fraud is a real and serious possibility,\u201D said Newton. \u201CThe key for onboarding is to prevent fraud in a manner that is as efficient as possible while preserving the financial rights of legitimate users as much as possible.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While Chivo users should see a marked improvement in the app with AlphaPoint and Netki\u2019s technology going forward, some people who have reported problems in the past few months appear to still be waiting for their issues to be resolved.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For example, two people recently told The Block that they still do not have access to their Chivo accounts, for unknown reasons.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to AlphaPoint\u2019s Igor Telyatnikov, the majority of the issues were reported before AlphaPoint\u2019s system went live, and any prior cases would need to be resolved through a queue. This is not unusual for financial apps.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere\u2019s two types of issues that could happen: There could be bugs and more technical issues that, if they\u2019re reported to us, we\u2019re definitely on it,\u201D AlphaPoint\u2019s Board Chairman (and Igor\u2019s brother) Vadim Telyatnikov said, noting that AlphaPoint has a team in El Salvador to help with these issues. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He added: \u201CAs far as account-related issues, if an account is locked or something else happens, that\u2019s an operational thing managed by the government.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In other words, AlphaPoint will help provide tools to navigate account-related problems but will have no control over blocked accounts. A representative from Netki also confirmed to The Block that it did not control blocking users\u2019 wallets, and said that any questions regarding this should be directed to Chivo.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One issue that should be improved in the app is the Lightning Network transactions, Igor Telyatnikov said. AlphaPoint has provided a new Lightning Network integration with a new node. \u201CIf there were issues with Lightning, they should not be happening,\u201D he said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, it\u2019s unclear how many people continue to have issues with the app, how long that backlog could take to clear and what specific tools are in place to resolve these previous issues.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When The Block asked what people with prior issues could expect in terms of getting them resolved, AlphaPoint\u2019s Board Chairman Vadim Telyatnikov said:&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe\u2019re working on things that are reported to us, it is possible if something was stuck before the transition and we don\u2019t have any way to kind of research or identify it, it\u2019s possible we might not be able to fix it.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But then, Igor Telyatnikov jumped in to clarify: \u201CUsers\u2019 transaction history and data is all there, so I think if somebody has a legitimate issue, it will get resolved, it\u2019s a matter of time,\u201D he said. \u201CThat\u2019s really the case, and I think that part of what AlphaPoint brings is the tools to resolve these kinds of issues faster.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Want to read more long-form articles from The Block?
