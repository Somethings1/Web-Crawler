Currently in the testnet phase, the blockchain is being developed based on zkEVM from Polygon\u2019s Supernets software stack and aims to offer a decentralized perpetual trading platform.","Polygon\u2019s Supernets enables developers to build customizable app-chains that can operate as either sidechains or Layer 2 chains. In the case of IDEX, it\u2019s the latter.","IDEX will also integrate Polygon\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221420\/polygon-to-help-develop-immutable-zkevm-secured-by-matic-stakers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">zkEVM<\/a> technology to function as a Layer 2 network, deriving its security from Ethereum.","Founded in 2017, IDEX was counted as one of the most notable decentralized exchanges on Ethereum between 2017 and 2019, alongside other DEXs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/40562\/two-suspects-in-etherdelta-hack-indicted-by-u-s-authorities\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EtherDelta<\/a>. However, the advent and subsequent popularity of automated market makers, starting with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/148465\/dex-protocol-uniswap-hits-1-trillion-cumulative-trading-volume\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Uniswap<\/a>, led to a decrease in IDEX\u2019s competitive advantage. Now, IDEX is looking to reinvent itself with its own Layer 2 network.","\u201CThroughout the six years of our company history our development has focused on matching the performance and user experience of centralized exchanges,\u201D said Alex Wearn, co-founder and CEO at IDEX. \"Xchain represents the final piece necessary to go head-to-head with centralized exchanges.\u201D","IDEX <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/74153\/decentralized-exchange-idex-seed-funding-idex-2-0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> $2.5 million in seed funding round in 2020.","Xchain also aligns perfectly with Polygon's strategy of enabling existing crypto projects to create their own blockchains. In the past, the Polygon team has assisted projects in developing individual chains for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221420\/polygon-to-help-develop-immutable-zkevm-secured-by-matic-stakers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Immutable<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221942\/gaming-project-aavegotchi-to-release-own-blockchain-with-polygon-supernets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aavegotchi<\/a>, also created with Supernets.","\u201CThis is a great example of exactly the types of products we were envisioning when we built Polygon Supernets powered with zkEVM and Polygon zkEVM,\u201D said Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon. \u201CWe\u2019re just at the beginning, but when others see what IDEX is able to do with this technology, we know they\u2019re going to rush to implement it as well.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
