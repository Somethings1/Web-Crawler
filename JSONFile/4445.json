There also seemed to be a fairly strong acceptance of the notion that centralized crypto exchanges needed to step up tax reporting and transparency on their data, as well as user information \u2014 though the regulatory entity that should be responsible was a matter of disagreement.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nonetheless, an established partisan divide on crypto was on display. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As Representative Don Beyer, the chairman of the committee, described it to The Block in a follow-up interview:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CYou have the structure of the debate already, which is that the Republicans are going to want as light a touch as possible, arguing that all the structures are already in place to make sure there's not fraud.
