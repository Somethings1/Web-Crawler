If the SEC has approved bitcoin futures ETFs, Grayscale argued, the door was open for a spot-based fund \u2014 a contention the regulator disputed.","The agency has reasoned that futures products are harder to manipulate as the market is smaller and based on futures prices from the CME, which is CFTC-regulated.&nbsp;","The SEC continued to argue much the same point through the end of the year. In December, the regulator said its rejection was \"reasonable, reasonably explained, supported by substantial evidence,\" with \"no inconsistency in the Commission's disapproval of Grayscale's spot ETP despite having approved two CME bitcoin futures ETPs.\"","The SEC said its disapproval of the proposed ETF did not reflect an \"impermissible, merits-based skepticism of bitcoin as an investment.\"&nbsp;","Perhaps one of the most important elements of GBTC in recent years has been its discount to net asset value, at which the shares in the fund trade. The discount has narrowed to 42% ahead of tomorrow's hearing, according to The Block's data, meaning shares in the fund are 42% cheaper than the value of the bitcoin in the fund.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/structured-products\/premium-of-gbtc\/embed\" title=\"Daily GBTC Premium\/Discount to NAV\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Unlike other investment products, GBTC shares don't grant investors a right to underlying bitcoin since there is no redemption program in place currently.&nbsp;","The lack of this function means that since 2014 there has been a disparity between GBTC's trading price and its net asset value.
