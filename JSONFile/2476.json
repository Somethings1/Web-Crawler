The equity round was led by existing investor Bain Capital Ventures and new investor The KCK Group, with participation from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Winklevoss Capital and Polychain Capital. The $40 million round was led by New York-based credit fund Upper90.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nWinklevoss Capital also participated in Crusoe's $4.5 million <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190503005361\/en\/Crusoe-Energy-Systems-Closes-4.5-Million-Seed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">seed round<\/a> in May, which was led by Bain Capital Ventures.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gas flaring<\/strong>","Through its projects, including bitcoin mining facility, Crusoe aims to solve the growing problem of gas flaring, where energy companies burn off excess gas in the absence of adequate pipeline capacity. Citing data from the World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, Crusoe said nearly 497 billion cubic feet of natural gas are flared annually in the U.S., which is enough gas to power over 10 million homes.","With its bitcoin mining farm, for instance, Crusoe plans to utilize about 10 million cubic feet a day of gas which otherwise would have got wasted, Lochmiller told Bloomberg. \u201CIt\u2019s a very creative way to solve an environmental and economic problem for the oil and gas industry,\u201D Alex Urdea, the chief investment officer of Upper90, was quoted as saying in the report.","Crusoe plans to deploy up to 40 Digital Flare Mitigation (DFM) systems through the first half of 2020, per the announcement. The company currently has flare mitigation projects operating in three oilfields - Wyoming's Powder River Basin, Colorado's Denver-Julesburg, and North Dakota and Montana's Bakken. Crusoe said its DFM systems are scalable up to millions of cubic feet per day and can be deployed anywhere in the U.S. or Canada.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Is the U.S. becoming a new China?<\/strong>","The U.S. appears to be becoming another China for cryptocurrency mining.

But that\u2019s not the main reason bitcoin miners are flocking to the state. Rather, regulatory stability is the key driver, several industry participants told The Block at the time. \u201CIn China, mining is a dirty business,\u201D said Leo Zhang, research lead at Iterative Capital, referring to the fact that bitcoin miners in China usually need to have a deep understanding of the local political and social culture, and possess a substantial social network to set up their mining business.","Yet, around 70% of the crypto mining market is currently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/43253\/thiel-crypto-investors-pour-50-million-into-new-bitcoin-miner-aimed-in-us\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dominated<\/a> by Chinese miners and the top 5 known mining pools are also all based in China."],"hashtag":[]}
