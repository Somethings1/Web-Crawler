For instance, the committee has proposed that crypto-assets should not be eligible to serve as financial collateral for the purpose of the credit risk mitigation framework.","It has also recommended that bank exposures to crypto-assets should be subject to a \u201Cfull deduction\u201D from Common Equity Tier 1 capital, which mainly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/common-equity-tier-1-cet1.asp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">consists of<\/a> common stock held by a bank. \u201CThis treatment reflects the high degree of uncertainty about the positive realizable value of crypto-assets in times of stress,\u201D it added.","While banks\u2019 exposures to crypto-assets are currently \u201Climited,\u201D the absolute size of the market is \u201Cmeaningful,\u201D said the committee, adding that a \u201Crobust\u201D regulatory framework is needed for the sector.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Warning&nbsp;<\/strong>","In March, the committee <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/15616\/basel-committee-warns-against-crypto-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">warned<\/a> banks about risks associated with cryptocurrencies, including liquidity, credit and money laundering risks. \u201CThe continued growth of crypto-asset trading platforms and new financial products related to crypto-assets has the potential to raise financial stability concerns and increase risks faced by banks,\u201D it said at the time.","Reiterating its point, the committee said that if a crypto-asset and a \"traditional\" asset are equivalent in their economic functions and the risks they pose, they should not be treated differently for prudential purposes. \"There is the potential for certain types of crypto-assets to become systemically important. The design of the prudential treatment of crypto-assets should therefore be simple and flexible in nature,\" said the committee.","If the committee decides to go ahead with any specified treatment, it would constitute a minimum standard for internationally active banks. The discussion paper is open for comments until March 13, 2020 to all stakeholders, including academics, banks, central banks, finance ministries, market participants and the general public, among others.","Â© 2023 The Block.
