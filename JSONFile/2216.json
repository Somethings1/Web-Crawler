According to Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson, the firm is the first to have transaction monitoring capacity for XRP and it has already identified several hundred XRP accounts related to illegal activities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Per Elliptic\u2019s research, the XRP volume involved in illicit activities is only 0.2% of the token\u2019s total transaction volume. However, unlike bitcoin, whose illegal activities are usually dark market related, a notable proportion of XRP-related illegal activities is scams and Ponzi schemes, according to Robinson. Robinson said this difference is likely due to XRP\u2019s popularity among retail users.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI suspect there are a lot of retail holders of XRP, which may be an attractive target for scammers,\u201D Robinson told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Due to the unique structure of XRP blockchain\u2019s, when compared to that of Bitcoin's and Ethereum's blockchains, it took Elliptic a long time to deploy the monitoring solution, according to Robinson. However, there is much customer demand for XRP and the token\u2019s high exchange trading volumes made it an \u201Cobvious\u201D choice for Elliptic to support, said Robinson.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhen we decided to add another asset, that is primarily due to client demand which itself is driven by the market cap of the currency and also its exchange volume. So XRP was an obvious one that we just add.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The firm\u2019s XRP monitoring solution is currently still in beta testing, with official support rolling out in the first week of December.
