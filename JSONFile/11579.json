As of now, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">there are more than ten thousand currencies in the global digital money market, and the total crypto market value has exceeded USD2 trillion. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor also expressed that Bitcoin would continue to appreciate and he boldly predicted that the market value of Bitcoin would reach USD 100 trillion one day.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the crypto landscape does present some challenges. Financial services are heavily regulated around the world, and each region has its own compliance standards and guidelines to meet.

For global crypto institutions looking to provide custody solutions for clients around the world, the obstacles are particularly apparent.&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Providing compliant, customizable custodian services&nbsp;<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To ensure they trade and invest crypto in a regulatory-compliant environment, many institutional investors look to custody service providers for a diversified array of compliant and customizable custodian services.

But what\u2019s more important than the third-party documents is that, custody providers must demonstrate a continuing commitment to improving their risk management protocols.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As a registered trust company in Hong Kong, Huobi Trust Hong Kong is fully licensed and compliant with the requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615 of the laws of Hong Kong) and has obtained the Hong Kong Trust and Company Service Provider (TCSP) license (TCSP Licence No.: TC007494). As such, its daily operations must abide by the relevant Hong Kong regulations as well as the AML\/CTF requirements, which precludes the company from money laundering, terrorism financing, and other serious risks that custody providers would possibly face.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe realize transparency is the key to building trust with our clients, so we do our due diligence in this area,\u201D Zhang said.&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Making security a priority&nbsp;<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One of the biggest concerns for institutional investors is the risk of cyberattacks. Since the theft of 850,000 bitcoins by Mt. Gox in 2013, crypto service providers have been facing different level of security pressure. In 2020 alone, hackers have stolen more than USD120 million in the crypto space. In August 2021, hackers took advantage of Bilaxy's security vulnerabilities and stole more than USD21 million worth of cryptocurrency.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With an in-depth knowledge of best practices in security, Huobi Trust Hong Kong says it remains focused on cyber threats prevention and client assets protection via its in-house security infrastructure and a time-tested risk control framework.
