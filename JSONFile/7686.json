So, no actual death or injury occurred here at this repurposed warehouse in south Denver, Colorado.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I\u2019m in Denver for the Ethereum-focused conference, ETHDenver. I came here hoping to get a sense of the most cutting-edge trends in the Ethereum world. I did not expect any of these to involve Loot.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In case you don\u2019t remember Loot, it was one of the most talked-about things in crypto for a few weeks in the late summer and early fall of 2021. Enthusiasts were buying Loot NFTs attached to images of nothing but white text on a black background. The text, which included things like \u201Cwarhammer,\u201D \u201Ccrown\u201D and \u201CNecklace of Perfection\u201D is supposed to refer to items in a yet-to-be-created fantasy game.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Loot hype then seemed to die down almost as quickly as it had taken off. But Loot still has enthusiasts \u2014 and some of them have been busy tying the game\u2019s NFTs to real-world objects, for use in a real-world version of the game.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LootLARP weapons with chips in them. Photo by MK Manoylov.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What I have just witnessed was your standard LARP experience \u2014 with a web3 twist.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The whole battle arena was put on by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lootlarp.xyz\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LootLARP<\/a>, an organization that creates physical elements and designs gameplay for Loot.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Loot itself was born last August when Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/116746\/cryptos-latest-trend-is-to-play-games-before-theyre-even-built\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">published a link<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to an Ethereum contract<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that people could use to create a limited number of \u201Cbags\u201D of \u201Crandomized adventure gear.\u201D The bags were actually just lists of words.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A Loot NFT.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The simplicity inspired LootLARP\u2019s core contributor, who goes by <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ndimwit online and prefers to remain pseudonymous<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. \u201CA Loot NFT is literally just text \u2014 it\u2019s the most low-fidelity thing there could be,\u201D said ndimwit. \u201CSo I figured, why don't we try to actually physicalize the universe?\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LootLARP partnered with a Quebec-based manufacturer to create foam role-playing items like swords, maces and magic tomes. And it worked with Kong, a company that primarily makes chips for crypto payment cards, to \u201Cembed\u201D NFTs into the items.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The LootLARP broadsword I had a chance to hold felt about as heavy as a bottle of wine. The firm foam of the blade yielded in my palm when squeezed. On the butt of the sword, the exposed chip looked like a small, black navigational compass with a yellow face.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The LootLARP team showed me how their app scans LootLARP NFTs, tracks player data and displays quests. The team is still developing LootLARP\u2019s quests and game world as well as methods to privatize user data, but it\u2019s supposed to be finished in time for the NFT NYC conference in June. The plan is to let people use LootLARP\u2019s tech to play at the conference.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In Times Square, a town crier will direct players to pick up their weapons from the LootLARP truck. Players will then scan the chips in their items. The chips, which the project\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lootproject.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">website<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> calls \u201Clow-cost, durable, secure elements that can be cryptographically linked to an Ethereum smart contract,\u201D sign transactions that tie the object to the blockchain and confirm that the owner has entered the game\u2019s universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">From there, players can tackle various quests, which the LootLARP team is creating to <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">demonstrate various use cases and to quickly create a compelling and cohesive experience, set in the Lootverse,\u201D according to ndimwit<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To receive admission to the game, users must mint a so-called Redemption NFT, which ndimwit said is essentially a ticket. They must also have one of the original Loot NFTs, or an mLoot NFT \u2014 an offshoot of the original Loot project which stands for \u201CMore Loot\u201D \u2014 to \u201Cactivate\u201D their item, according to LootLARP\u2019s website.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The in-game transaction fees should be low since LootLARP uses Ethereum scaling platform Polygon. Still, ndimwit said the team is considering covering the fees for the NFT.NYC event.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the true spirit of Loot, the project\u2019s ultimate goal is to let the players build the game. The current LootLARP platform only consists of the chip-enabled physical items and player app, but the team plans to build features in which users can create their own quests.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhat we're building is essentially like a platform for people to make quests and games for each other, so that they can collectively build the world together,\u201D ndimwit said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSomething about [Loot] really captured the spirit of web3 for me, in a way where it's opening up creative use cases like world-building as a decentralized process,\u201D he says. With LootLARP, \u201Cwe can do something that\u2019s at the bleeding edge of crypto.\u201D<\/span>","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
