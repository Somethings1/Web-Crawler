Infrastructure issues throughout the opening week meant that, in fact, considerably less tokens were distributed to begin with. <\/span>The whitepaper states that of the initial 143 million tokens, 43 million went to verified users, while 100 million were lent to five market makers operating outside of the U.S. for a term of three months.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alex Blania, CEO of Worldcoin\u2019s main developer Tools for Humanity, defended the rollout of WLD in an episode of <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/RrF2LbuSYoA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Scoop podcast<\/a>. He said the team expected to take some heat over the low float, but felt it was necessary.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWorldcoin is just by design very different because the whole point is that we actually want to get this to billions of people and we are very determined to do that,\u201D Blania said. \u201CAnd that means that we cannot hand out 10% of the circulating supply. It would be ridiculous. It would be very unfair.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Worldcoin did not respond to separate requests for comment on the WLD launch.&nbsp;<\/span>","At launch, Worldcoin\u2019s token WLD rocketed to a fully diluted valuation of $28 billion \u2014 though that number has now fallen to $23 billion.

Which is something that we\u2019ve seen historically with a lot of projects.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The aim, at launch, was to have market makers \u201Cdamp\u201D large spikes in interest, Blania added.&nbsp;<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
