The company has made the cryptocurrency its primary treasury reserve asset in recent months.","MicroStrategy turned in its highest Q3 total revenue since 2016, which is a 6% increase from last year. Profit reached $19.8 million, increasing from last year's reported $11.6 million.&nbsp;","What's changed is its bitcoin play. After the July announcement of its intention to transfer its reserves towards bitcoin, the firm purchased $425 million or 38,250 BTC at $11,111 a coin this quarter. This, said President and CFO Phong Li, has boosted MicroStrategy's reputation and brought in more prospective customers.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["MICROSTRATEGY"]}
