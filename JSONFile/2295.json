Analysis suggested that the two transactions were likely rejected by ViaBTC and Foundry by accident, while the F2Pool filtered them intentionally, the researcher wrote.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That was informally confirmed by F2Pool co-founder Chung Wang, who commented in a now-deleted post on X: \"Why do you feel surprised when I refuse to confirm transactions for those criminals, dictators and terrorists?

OFAC and FinCEN will only ramp up pressure on the crypto industry, he told The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sanctions and legal actions against crypto mixers, including, most famously, Tornado Cash, showed that the regulators are willing to be innovative in their ways.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"FinCEN (the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) issued a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/federal_register_notices\/2023-10-19\/FinCEN_311MixingNPRM_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposed special measure<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> designating all of cryptocurrency mixing as a primary money laundering concern,\u201D Hutten said. \"Historically, it's only taken such measures against a jurisdiction or against a financial institution. Recently, however, it took those special measures against a class of transactions.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There is still little risk for small individual miners, Hutten believes. \"But if you're a mining service, for example, you find a new block, you get a new bitcoin, you hold it, then you split it up 20 ways and send it out, and in that case you very well will be caught by [the rules] and have a regulated status in the United States as a money transmitter,\" Hutten said.<\/span>","Recent news related to the stablecoin tether offers another glimpse of how the relationship between crypto and U.S. regulators may develop in the near future. Tether has been freezing crime-related addresses for years now and has recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266872\/tether-freezes-all-ofac-sanctioned-wallets-in-proactive-security-measure\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> that it blocked addresses from a U.S. sanctions list.

He added that it was impractical for companies to \"filter\" Bitcoin transactions, but that the company would comply if there was a legal requirement to do so.&nbsp;","\"Everybody in the industry recognizes that they\u2019re not going to win a firefight with the U.S. government,\" concurred CoinShares\u2019 Bendiksen. U.S. miners and pools with publicly known teams and founders will likely comply, even with rules they don\u2019t necessarily agree with, he added.","The idea of transaction censorship makes no sense for miners economically, Bendiksen continued. If you\u2019re not mining this or that transaction, someone else will mine it and snatch the fee, he said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, problems with U.S. regulators might cost even more. In a hypothetical situation where all major pools agree to filter a certain list of transactions, there still will be miners who won't follow those rules. But they will represent a smaller part of the total hashrate, so it might take hours or even days for a \"prohibited\" transaction to be finally written into the blockchain, Bendiksen said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It's theoretically possible that an emerging, unofficial consensus could push not just for the avoidance of mining OFAC-blacklisted transactions, but also for the orphaning of blocks with such transactions mined by other miners, refusing to build new blocks upon them. That could be considered a sort of 51% attack on Bitcoin, leading to a chain split, Bendiksen said, and such an idea has already been entertained in Washington policy circles.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Carole House, a former White House director for cybersecurity and secure digital innovation, who is now executive in residence at Terranet Ventures, spoke at the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/decenter.princeton.edu\/events\/decenter-spring-conference\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DeCenter Spring Conference<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> at Princeton University in April, proposing exactly that.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In her <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/819245954\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">speech<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, House suggested that it would be great if miners, as well as validators of proof-of-stake blockchains, came together and agreed not to mine OFAC-blacklisted transactions, as well as not to build upon blocks with such transactions. She also noted that having as much hashpower as possible in the U.S., where miners have to comply with the sanctions, would help make that vision a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"My feeling based on my interaction with the industry this year is that there is much more of a concern about compliance, particularly in the second half of this year,\" Hutten said. <\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
