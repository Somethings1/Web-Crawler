Of these liquidations, the vast majority, $73 million, were short positions. Bitcoin short positions took the largest share of the damage, with over $29 million in short liquidations in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinglass.com\/LiquidationData\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a>.","The wipe out of short position came as bitcoin broke through the $38,000 mark earlier today before retracing its steps.

This situation could make risk assets like bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher returns in a lower interest rate environment,\" Bitfinex analysts told The Block.","However, the analysts added that other narratives are at play. \"Long-term bitcoin supply has continued to remain dormant while the lower timeframes currently show aggressive market participants chasing price, market buying, above the crucial $37,500 level. This resilience might also be reflecting in ether's performance, along with bitcoin steadily trading above $37,500.\" the analysts said."],"hashtag":[]}
