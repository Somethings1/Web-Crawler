It can be used to encrypt information that is stored on a server \u2014 to protect against unauthorized access or tampering. Notably, keys generated via PGP can be used to verify a specific piece of data, such as the legitimacy of a software download.","While what exactly caused the exploit is not yet confirmed, many speculate a server Dashjr used may have been accessed to steal data, including private keys to his bitcoin wallet. In November, Dashjr <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LukeDashjr\/status\/1593227756841578496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> that his server had been compromised.","\"The hack is still pretty fresh, so there is still not much clarity on what might have happened, besides PGP keys compromised and speculation that private keys might have been stolen from a previous server hack,\" noted Gustavo Gonzalez, solutions developer at OpenZeppelin.","The pseudonymous developer of Yearn Finance, Banteg,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bantg\/status\/1609740686298841090\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">commented<\/a> on Twitter the incident may be a potential \"supply chain attack.\u201D Supply chain attacks happen when a hacker enters and modifies software by injecting malicious code into a system. A formal investigation is yet to confirm this.&nbsp;","The incident has garnered a lot of attention.
