The SC has, therefore, issued a public reprimand against Binance Holdings Limited, its CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, and three other entities \u2014 \"Binance Digital Limited (Registered in the UK), Binance UAB (Registered in Lithuania), and Binance Asia Services Pte Ltd (Registered in Singapore).\"","All the four entities have been ordered by the SC to disable the Binance website \u2014&nbsp;www.binance.com&nbsp;\u2014 and its mobile applications in Malaysia within 14 business days from July 26.

The FCA's order, however, did not impact&nbsp;Binance.com's offerings because BML does not operate the website.
