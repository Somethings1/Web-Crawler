Only three crypto exchanges accounted for more than 5% \u2014 Upbit (6.1%), OKX (5.4%) and Coinbase (5.3%) \u2014 while Kucoin and FTX accounted for 4.7% and 4.5%, respectively.","Binance's U.S. exchange also beat out FTX.US, with the former garnering 1.4% of the total volume and the latter accounting for 0.6%.","The story remains the same when it comes to crypto derivatives trading \u2014 at least, as far as Binance is concerned \u2014 with the exchange laying claim to a similarly high 54.4% of the total volume over the past 24 hours.","The difference on the derivatives front comes down to Binance's competitors claiming larger pieces of the pie. OKX holds claim to the second highest derivatives volume at just over 14%, while Bybit comes in third with 10.2%. FTX, meanwhile, has 8.8%.","Binance's apparent dominance on the volume front coincides with increasing market share in the stablecoin sector. The supply share of Binance USD (BUSD) in the overall stablecoin market <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179199\/binances-stablecoin-clocks-in-marketshare-all-time-high-as-supply-tops-20-billion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">continues<\/a> to set new all-time highs after Binance began converting other stablecoins to its own stablecoin last month.&nbsp;","Meanwhile, Binance continues to make regulatory inroads into Europe. Last Thursday, the exchange announced that Cyprus had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/178625\/binance-gains-fourth-european-approval-in-cyprus\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">approved<\/a> its registration as a&nbsp;Crypto Asset Services Provider. Previously, it gained regulatory approval in three other European countries \u2014 France, Italy and Spain. Binance also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/173895\/binance-secures-new-zealand-registration-opens-local-office\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">gained<\/a> regulatory approval in New Zealand and opened a local office earlier in October."],"hashtag":["BINANCE"]}
