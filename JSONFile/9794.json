This rise suggests that institutions and large capital allocators are increasingly focused on bitcoin as an investment option, Ark said.","The report also highlighted a divergence in trends between USDC and Tether. While USDC has experienced a 37% decrease in supply year-to-date, Tether has seen a 25% increase, reaching an all-time high in June. Ark said this divergence can be attributed to the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S., pushing some crypto activity offshore, and the brief depegging of USDC in March following issuer Circle\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/218993\/usdc-and-dai-remain-at-about-0-90-following-circles-disclosure-of-funds-at-svb\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">disclosure<\/a> it held $3.3 billion of USDC\u2019s reserves at the failed Silicon Valley Bank.","Despite the positive indicators for bitcoin, Ark's report warned of economic challenges ahead, with data from the manufacturing sector indicating a decline in new orders in the Purchasing Managers' Index. Additionally, the U.S. Gross Domestic Income (GDI) is contracting sequentially, implying a possible recession, Ark said.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
