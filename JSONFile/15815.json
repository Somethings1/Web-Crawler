He did not write the Bitcoin white paper, produce the Bitcoin code or implement the Bitcoin system,\u201D COPA Counsel Jonathan Hough said.","Wright was accused by COPA and a group of Bitcoin developers of committing forgeries in his attempts to prove he was Satoshi. On Tuesday, COPA also accused Wright of being a \u201Cdishonest witness\u201D and attempting \u201Cvery serious fraud\u201D while testifying in court.","COPA said emails concerning Wright\u2019s former lawyers submitted to the court during the trial (that Wright later defended were \u201Cspoofed\u201D by unnamed bad actors) and admissions that he edited the Bitcoin white paper as recently as November 2023 are \u201Cvivid emblems\u201D of his lies.","The alliance hopes the trial will once and for all prove Wright isn\u2019t Satoshi and has said it will seek \u201Cinjunctive relief\u201D to prevent Wright from pursuing further action against members of the crypto community on the basis that he\u2019s Satoshi.","Read more: COPA vs Wright: What's at Stake as the Trial to Determine Satoshi's Identity Wraps Up","To defend the \u201Cfiction\u201D that he\u2019s Satoshi, Wright has \u201Ccommitted perjury and forgery to an extraordinary extent,\u201D COPA said in its closing arguments.","COPA warned the alliance will ask to refer the files in this case to U.K. prosecutors \u201Cfor consideration of prosecution for the offenses of perjury and perverting the course of justice.\u201D","Counsel for a separate group of Bitcoin developers is set to begin closing statements on Wednesday. Wright\u2019s team will start its statements after that in a final push before presiding Judge James Mellor\u2019s ruling.","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"November 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Craig Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jonathan Hough","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Satoshi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"James Mellor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"COPA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Craig Wright","COPA","Bitcoin","Trial"],"authors":["Sandali Handagama"]}
