The Council is currently chaired by France. The deal was made in the nick of time, just over one day before France would have had to cede control over talks to the Czech Republic.","Read more: Crypto Privacy Positions Harden Ahead of Crunch EU Vote","For the rules on transfers to unhosted wallets, Kovařík said the final result had \u201Cmoved quite far from the initial proposal of the European Parliament\u201D \u2013 something likely to be met by a sigh of relief by many in the industry.","Kovařík said those unhosted wallet rules would only apply when transfers were made to a person\u2019s own private wallet, and only when the value was over 1,000 euros ($1,052). A further source briefed on talks has confirmed those details.","Ernest Urtasun, a member of the European Greens party, who jointly led parliament\u2019s negotiations on the law, tweeted that the rules were \u201Cputting an end to the wild west of unregulated crypto, closing major loopholes in the European anti-money laundering rules.\"","Urtasun confirmed that the final deal would mean that, for transactions between regulated wallets, customer identity details have to be recorded for even the smallest transaction. That makes crypto rules unlike those for the conventional banking sector, which only catch those worth over 1,000 euros.","Lawmakers and governments overturned European Commission plans to exempt small transactions, arguing that price volatility and the ability to break up payments into smaller chunks would make it unworkable for crypto.","Socialist lawmaker Paul Tang, who had pushed for tough anti-money laundering measures, told CoinDesk in a statement the deal meant \u201Cthe verification of unhosted wallets is deeply engrained in the EU's fight against money laundering through crypto.\u201D","\u201CWe cannot just focus on the regulated sector while keeping the backdoor open to large anonymous crypto flows,\u201D Tang said.","The deal, which sets the essential policy lines that the final law will take, still needs to be translated into legislative text and gazetted in the EU\u2019s Official Journal.","UPDATE (June 29, 18:49 UTC): Adds comment from EU lawmaker Paul Tang and tweet from lawmaker Ondřej Kovařík.","UPDATE (June 29, 19:28 UTC): Adds comment from lawmaker Ondřej Kovařík and tweet from Ernest Urtasun.
