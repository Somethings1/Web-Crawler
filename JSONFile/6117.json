That question is at the heart of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuit against Coinbase, as the agency is accusing the company of selling unregistered securities and operating an unlicensed staking-as-a-service program.&nbsp;","But after the SEC\u2019s lawyers faced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/273221\/judge-grills-the-sec-with-pointed-questions-as-coinbase-hearing-begins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pointed questions<\/a> from New York District Judge Katherine Polk Failla, who wondered aloud whether or not the agency\u2019s definition of collectibles was too broad, a Bloomberg analyst has estimated that Coinbase currently has the edge in the case.&nbsp;","\u201CThe judge wanted a limiting principle to the SEC definition of \"investment contract\" that wouldn't encompass collectibles. We view the one offered by Coinbase as more compelling, requiring investment in a business vs. just an ecosystem, along with an enforceable obligation,\u201D Bloomberg senior litigation analyst Elliott Stein <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/nycstein\/status\/1748334299957367287?s=61&amp;t=7I5yxo0xaR4rsiFzR69uRg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a>.&nbsp;","Coinbase\u2019s lawyers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/273253\/coinbase-takes-its-turn-in-court-arguing-the-tokens-it-listed-are-not-securities\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">argued<\/a> that not all cryptocurrency purchases constituted investment contracts, likening the difference to \u201Cinvesting in Beanie Baby Inc. and buying Beanie Babies.\u201D Also in question was whether or not the tokens had an \u201Cecosystem\u201D behind them; lawyers on both sides differed on whether or not Bitcoin constituted an ecosystem, for example, with the SEC\u2019s lawyers arguing that it does not.&nbsp;","Judge Faila did not rule from the bench at the end of the four-hour hearing, saying she needed more time to consider the questions at hand. If Coinbase\u2019s motion is dismissed, either whole or in part, the case will continue on to discovery. Stein\u2019s analysis notes that Coinbase may not win this motion, but projects that the company will win eventually.&nbsp;","\u201COur Thesis: Coinbase is 70% likely to beat the SEC, if not outright on this motion, then later,\u201D Stein wrote. \u201CEven if the case survives, it likely reaches the Supreme Court, which we think will narrow Howey,\u201D Stein also argued, referring to the standard for deeming assets as securities under U.S. law.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
