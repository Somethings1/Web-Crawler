Account abstraction allows wallets to work similarly to smart contracts and handle more complex tasks automatically.","\u201CMantle Network is the first among the L2 blockchains currently in testnet to hit mainnet, and the only modular chain amongst a forest of monoliths,\u201D Mantle strategic advisor Jordi Alexander said. \u201CAs this burgeoning space sizzles on the eve of \u2018L2 Summer\u2019, the agility enabled by Mantle Network's adaptive and iterative design will keep it at the bleeding edge of the latest technological breakthroughs for years to come.\u201D","The scalability of the Layer 2 opens up use cases like more advanced blockchain gaming, DeFi and social protocols without incurring high fees, Mantle added.","Mantle\u2019s mainnet alpha launches with partners including blockchain gaming accelerator Game7, web3 game launcher HyperPlay and blockchain education initiative EduDAO. Infrastructure providers and dApps like Ankr, Bullieverse, Covalent, LayerZero and The Graph also contribute to the network.","The DAO-led ecosystem recently approved a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238570\/mantle-network-is-voting-to-form-a-200-million-ecosystem-fund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$200 million<\/a> ecosystem fund to support the development of early-stage dApps on the Ethereum Layer 2, which it proposed last week.","The fund launched in collaboration with venture partners including Animoca Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, Figment Capital, Hashkey Capital, Pantera Capital, QCP Capital and SevenX Ventures and is operated by Mirana Ventures.","Â© 2023 The Block.
