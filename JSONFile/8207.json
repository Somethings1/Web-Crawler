The current stage permits the public to stake in SSV via launch partner apps.","During this launch phase, users can only stake through the partner staking applications. In the fourth quarter, when the network begins the final phase of the rollout called \u201Cpermissionless launch,\u201D users will be able stake directly with SSV Network and also become a node operator.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SSV Network offers a decentralized staking mechanism by connecting users to a network of \u201Coperators\u201D responsible for jointly managing Ethereum validator nodes in a trust-minimized fashion.

The SSV team said its DVT facilitates the sharing of each validator managing 32 ETH among several operators with the help of BLS signatures. Simply put, it employs a distinct cryptographic protocol to distribute operational and key management tasks across multiple users.&nbsp;","As a result, the team claims the network can also assist existing staking protocols to further decentralize.","\u201COur goal is to onboard even more users who would be otherwise wary of trusting single entities, while not wanting to go through the relatively complex process of staking independently,\u201D said Alon Muroch, Protocol Lead at SSV. \u201CIn one stroke, DVTs can alleviate all of the staking centralization concerns we\u2019ve heard in recent years.\u201D","In Feb. 2022, SSV Network <a href=\"https:\/\/cryptobriefing.com\/ssv-network-raises-10m-boost-ethereum-staking-infrastructure\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> $10 million from Digital Currency Group, Coinbase, and other investors.","The project competes with other DVT developers such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/120960\/obol-technologies-seed-funding-crypto-staking-protocol\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Obol<\/a> and Diva.","Â© 2023 The Block.
