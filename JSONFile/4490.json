The reality is that most of the crypto going through the protocol is destined for conversion back into fiat before it is spent. The US plays a central role in that process globally. It\u2019s the same reason that the US sanctions regime is such a powerful tool in traditional finance.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the absence of secondary sanctions, it\u2019s true that non-US entities are broadly speaking still allowed to transact. But financial intermediaries around the world \u2014 the ones non-US Tornado Cash users will need in order to cash out \u2014 will now see these transactions as risky. As those entities back away, it\u2019s likely that Tornado Cash will lose much of its liquidity.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moreover, it\u2019s not just legitimate institutions that want to avoid OFAC-designated entities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CEven if you\u2019re an illicit actor, you don\u2019t want to put your money somewhere the US government is shining a light,\u201D said Ari Redbord, a former advisor at the Treasury\u2019s office of terrorism and financial intelligence who now leads the legal team at blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The involvement of North Korea\u2019s Lazarus group in this case effectively damns any project associated with Tornado Cash, as the national security apparatus is significantly more aggressive than any US financial regulator.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt was really bad when we thought hackers attacked Ronin,\u201D said Redbord, referring to the recent <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/140165\/ronin-replaces-compromised-validators-and-plans-to-bolster-security-after-600-million-hack\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">theft of nearly $600 million<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> from the network underlying the game Axie Infinity. \u201CIt became a national security issue when we learned that it was North Korea.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While sanctions explicitly criminalize US persons or US-based entities from interacting with Tornado Cash or the designated associated wallets, their applications are significantly broader.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CEven if you are not a US person, cashing out funds from Tornado Cash at a compliant cryptocurrency service subject to US jurisdiction could still trigger a violation,\u201D wrote Andrew Fiernan, head of sanctions strategy at Chainalysis.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Some, such as Coin Center\u2019s Peter Van Valkenburgh, argued that OFAC had overstepped its authority by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XpTrCA3tEKM&amp;t=1059s\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">designating<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> an \u201Centity\u201D that is actually a smart contract. Typically, a legal entity is either an individual or a corporation, which gives it the right to, among other things, own property, open bank accounts and get representation in court. Tornado Cash can do none of these things. Most importantly, that means it cannot fight against its own designation.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The smart contract itself can still function \u2014 a mirror site is, in fact, already <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/tornadov3.cash\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">live<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. But the privatization features of Tornado Cash depend on having a sufficient user base. With the US Treasury having established an aggressive posture towards any new mixer that would take Tornado Cash\u2019s place, it\u2019s hard to picture one growing to the same scale as Tornado Cash \u2014 especially if state actors like the Lazarus Group begin using it \u2014 without encountering a similar OFAC action.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">From its experience with traditional financial investigations and sanctions, OFAC is already familiar with the whack-a-mole game of finding shell companies and related individuals holding assets for designated actors. With more tools to trace crypto, the Treasury seems set on taking that similar approach to digital finance.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Roman Semenov, a co-founder of Tornado Cash, did not return a request for comment as of publication time.<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
