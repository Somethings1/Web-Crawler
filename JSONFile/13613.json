Data from CoinGecko shows a 40% drop from $2.37 to $1.54 within that period.","Waves token down 40% in the last two weeks. Image: CoinGecko","A reportedly misleading DAXA warning about the market health of wave is to blame for the recent downward price action, Waves Labs <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.waves.tech\/en\/futures-data-shows-false-daxa-warning-damage\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> on Monday. DAXA is a South Korean digital asset collective. Major South Korean exchanges such as Upbit responded to the warning by halting waves token deposits.","This warning came amid mounting short interest in the waves token, according to the report. As such, the liquidity crunch created by halting deposits fostered the perfect environment for short sellers to make a significant profit, the report argued.","The waves token is not the only one in the protocol\u2019s ecosystem that is in a downward trajectory. Neutrino dollar (USDN), the Waves ecosystem algorithmic stablecoin has also lost its peg to the U.S. dollar by a significant amount. USDN is currently trading at $0.51 as of the time of publishing.","USDN lost its peg at the same time as waves began to decline following the DAXA warning. The stablecoin is backed by waves token and is supposed to trade at par with the U.S. dollar. Users mint USDN by staking their waves token in a protocol called Neutrino.","USDN depegs further.

He also stated that the protocol will come up with a way to remedy the USDN situation but did not provide any details.","It\u2019s just time to create a protocol more attuned to the current market conditions,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sasha35625\/status\/1605152617272934402\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> Ivanov, while adding, \u201CIt will be easier to stabilize USDN first and launch the new protocol after.\u201D","USDN is no stranger to losing its peg.
