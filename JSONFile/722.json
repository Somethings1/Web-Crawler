The difficulty level shifts based on how much processing power is connected to the network and is adjusted roughly every two weeks.&nbsp;","Although bitcoin's mining difficulty did adjust to a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/90633\/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-new-high-20-trillion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">all-time high<\/a> on January 9, it actually only increased by 3.5% compared to the previous high of 19.9 trillion, recorded on October 18.&nbsp;","As The Block reported at the time, bitcoin's mining difficulty adjusted a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/82404\/bitcoin-hashrate-miners-migrate\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">negative growth<\/a> of 16% in late October. This development was due to Chinese miner operators migrating from hydropower stations in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces to fossil-based power plants in the northern Chinese territories of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia.","After these miners gradually came back online \u2014 while new shipments of machines hit the market around the same time \u2014 the network's hash rate began increasing again amid bitcoin's price jump throughout Q4.&nbsp;","A combination of factors appears to be behind the relatively slow growth of the mining difficulty so far, which \u2013 at least for now \u2013 may be welcome news for those with active mining operations.","The shortage of wafers from the world's biggest semiconductor firms such as Samsung Foundry and TSMC have led to limited supplies of the newest bitcoin mining equipment from Chinese manufacturers despite increasing demand from their customers.","Preorders for top-of-the-line mining hardware made by Bitmain and MicroBT are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/88151\/bitcoin-mining-hardware-bidding-war\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">already sold out<\/a> until the second half of 2021.
