This comes as the media publishes headlines that read \u201CA.I. is \u2018one of the biggest risks\u2019 to civilization\u201D and industry leader Elon Musk urges regulation, claiming AI is potentially more dangerous than nuclear missiles. Many fear AI will replace human jobs, control the information we consume, and have ulterior motives. The solution to this is not to ban AI or introduce regulations, rather introduce humanity. Instead of creating systems completely devoid of human intelligence, we ought to combine the best aspects of both to uplift the human experience. This blend is called Augmented Intelligence (AuI) and because there is always a human involved, there will never be a sci-fi fear of a rogue AI determined to destroy humanity and replace all jobs. One company leading the charge is Celligence, a FinTech company that created an empathetic A.I. program called MORGAN. Augmented intelligence is already here and it is furthering human capabilities.","Humans vs Machines","After Chat GPT released its newest iteration in Open A.I.\u2019s GPT-4, Elon Musk famously called for a six-month pause on developing more advanced AI models. Hypocritically, Musk seeks a regulatory authority to ensure that development of A.I. serves the public interest, while also fighting against accountability for the defective A.I. in his self-driving","cars. Machines and A.I. will never replace humans. The question of whether A.I. will replace human workers assumes that A.I. and humans have the same qualities and abilities \u2014 but, in reality, they don\u2019t. AI is just another machine and machines are fast, more accurate, and excellent at repetitive work. They are not innovative, intuitive, emotional, or culturally sensitive. And, it\u2019s exactly these abilities that humans possess which make us effective. So, which form of intelligence is best, artificial or human? The answer is both. That\u2019s why augmented intelligence is the future. It\u2019s how macroeconomics will continue to thrive and create a more inclusive society fuelled by lower costs of production \u2013 as it has happened after every technological revolution.","One user of Auto-GPT created an A.I. called Chaos-GPT, which in the creator\u2019s own words, is designed \u201Cto empower GPT with Internet and Memory to Destroy Humanity.\u201D Why even try to create a program in detriment to society? An A.I. is not inherently evil. A.I will become evil and set out to destroy humanity for the same reason a person becomes evil- life experiences and data. Currently, large language models have been trained by indiscriminately feeding massive amounts of data off the Internet, however it does not know what to do with it or what\u2019s right or wrong. A.I. learns by solving problems, making mistakes and learning what the correct answer should be based on the training humans provide. If provided the correct training and environment, as Celligence has done, A.I. is a tool to deliver financial equality and inclusion. A.I. when misdirected and trained by mischievous zillionaires who have the sole purpose of expanding their power, becomes viral conduit for avarice. This illustrates why we need a human centered A.I. \u2013 Augmented Intelligence.","Case Study","The unhinged Chaos-GPT is in complete contrast to MORGAN, one of the first human centered A.I. program. Its mission is to spread equal opportunity to financial resources for all segments of society. Instead of being programmed with hate and bias, it is the first AI to be programmed with empathy. This is facilitated by always having a real human in control \u2013 like keeping your hand on the wheel of a self-driving vehicle. Morgan learns to be more empathetic and respectful the more it is used since a human\u2019s hand is continuously on Morgan\u2019s \u201Csteering wheel.\u201D The solution to truly useful and benevolent A.I.s isn\u2019t more parameters, it\u2019s more quality and domain specific training.","MORGAN\u2019s domain is financial services and she helps people get access to credit and buy a home. Home buying is a notoriously stressful process for all sides of the transaction and Morgan seeks to alleviate that stress. She is a personal assistant for the realtor, loan officer, and buyer and is available to them 24\/7. With these tools, MORGAN has reduced the decline rate for minority borrowers by half. An A.I. system like","MORGAN is able to do complicated calculations for a borrower\u2019s income instantaneously while also providing them human support whenever they feel lost. She is able to help a minority borrower with the same speed and efficiency as everyone else. For example, Minority borrowers sometimes have more complicated work histories and MORGAN can easily calculate income coming from multiple sources. A human may get overwhelmed by the file, tossing it aside in favor of a simpler, straightforward borrower with steady income. MORGAN bridges the gap for minorities, as displayed in the graph below:","<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-229672 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-05-at-6.39.45-AM-800x445.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-05-at-6.39.45-AM-800x445.png 800w, https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-05-at-6.39.45-AM-1200x667.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-05-at-6.39.45-AM-768x427.png 768w, https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-05-at-6.39.45-AM-1536x854.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-05-at-6.39.45-AM.png 1676w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">","This is the epitome of augmented intelligence \u2014 humans and technology cannot replace each other, only complement each other. Morgan is designed to help users by combining the efficiency of machines with the ingenuity of human beings. It is this symbiotic relationship that allows users to fully trust Morgan with their financial needs. Removing the human element entirely would cause distrust and unease.","\n<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by Sun West<\/i><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
