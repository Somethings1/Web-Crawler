When asked if the firm is planning to bring more such solutions to the market, Kemp said: \u201CThe vast majority fit the industries mentioned, but some work has been done in other industries too (protected by NDA agreements).\u201D","Gemological Institute of America, Hong Kong-based jewelry group Chow Tai Fook, Fred Meyer Jewelers and Pact and Moyo Gemstones, are some of Everledger\u2019s clients. \u201CWe have grown 300% in the last year alone, with customers in five continents,\u201D Kemp said, adding: \u201CWe are generating revenue healthily and focused on our continued client engagement and market adoption.\u201D","Everledger\u2019s team has been growing as well. It currently consists of 90 people in five countries - U.S., U.K., Australia, India and Israel, said Kemp.","The sustainable and ethical supply chain management is becoming a popular use case of blockchain technology. Just last week, Australian startup OpenSC, co-founded by BCG Digital Ventures and World Wide Fund for Nature Australia (WWF-Australia),<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/39884\/bcg-digitals-blockchain-supply-chain-startup-opensc-raises-4m-in-seed-funding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> raised<\/a> $4 million in seed funding for tracking goods known to have \u201Csignificant\u201D environmental or human rights risks within their supply chains.","Last month, tech giant IBM <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/34764\/ibm-lenovo-nokia-vodafone-launch-a-new-blockchain-network-for-supply-chain-management\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> a new blockchain network called \u201CTrust Your Supplier\u201D with several big-name companies such as Lenovo, Nokia, and Vodafone joining as founding participants. They aim to simplify supplier validation, onboarding, and life cycle information management.","However, all issues may not be resolved with blockchain-based supply chain management. As Steven Zheng of The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/the-fallacy-of-blockchain-supply-chains-18039\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a> earlier this year: \u201CBlockchains in supply chains can\u2019t fix humans, who are a fundamental aspect of a supply chain.\u201D Zheng explained that humans can swap tags such as an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) from real items on to fake items, and blockchain wouldn\u2019t know the difference since it is taking in information from the tag, which clearly states that whatever the tag is attached to is real.","Â© 2023 The Block.
