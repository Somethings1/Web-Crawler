The former crypto boss, who is awaiting an October trial on a $250 million bond, could be sentenced to more than 100 years in jail if he is convicted on all charges.","\u201CI\u2019m not sure how often the courts have encountered a defendant quite like [Sam Bankman-Fried],\" said Carol Van Cleef, a Washington, D.C. lawyer and CEO of Luminous Group. \"He is truly a millennial defendant who is used to living life large on social media and using all of the latest in encrypted and other communications channels to disseminate his views, which may raise issues in the context of court proceedings like this.\u201D&nbsp;","Prosecutors are seeking stricter changes to Bankman-Fried\u2019s bail terms, and the judge presiding over his case raised the specter of a felony during a court proceeding this week.","\u201CThere is probable cause he attempted to commit a felony while on pretrial release,\u201D Judge Lewis Kaplan said during a <a href=\"https:\/\/money.yahoo.com\/judge-warns-ftxs-bankman-fried-your-freedom-can-be-revoked-225436982.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hearing<\/span><\/a> on Thursday.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Prosecutors recently discovered Bankman-Fried had used a VPN, or virtual private network, while under house arrest at his parents\u2019 home in California. A VPN establishes an encrypted connection between a computer and the internet, providing a higher level of privacy. Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers said he used the private network to watch the Super Bowl and other NFL games, but that did not stop prosecutors from asking that his internet use be curtailed.","A Bankman-Fried spokesperson declined to comment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CHe shouldn't be anywhere near the computer or any of these things, or he's going to end up in a place where you can't use a computer,\u201D said Michael Popok, a lawyer and co-host of the \u201CLegal AF\u201D podcast. \u201CThey're gonna really tighten the screws on him \u2026 He still thinks he's the smartest person in the room and the judge is gonna disabuse him of that right quick.\u201D","Kaplan extended temporary restrictions to Bankman-Fried\u2019s bail, barring him from contacting current or former employees of FTX, using a VPN or using encrypted or ephemeral messaging apps. The judge asked lawyers for the government and Bankman-Fried to file proposed bail orders next week.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CHe could revoke the bail. He could put stricter provisions under the bail,\u201D Sorkin said. \u201CThere are any number of things the judge can do.\u201D<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The bail fiasco isn\u2019t Bankman-Fried\u2019s only legal blunder. The FTX founder had fought to keep private the names of two Stanford University academics who co-signed his bond with his parents. He lost that battle in court when the names of his co-signers, Larry Kramer and Andreas Paepcke, were revealed this week.&nbsp;","Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal woes could soon get even worse.

It's got dates, it's got deadlines, it's got filings.\u201D","A judge rejected a motion to appoint an independent examiner in the bankruptcy on Wednesday, siding with new FTX CEO John Ray and saying an investigation could cost the estate more than $100 million and pose security concerns. A spokesperson for FTX did not respond to a request for comment.","\u201CMr. Ray is a consummate professional, highly qualified with decades of experience in taking control of companies in dire financial condition,\u201D Judge John Dorsey said when issuing his ruling, offering a vote of confidence in Bankman-Fried\u2019s successor.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The bankrupt crypto exchange is on track to make progress on recouping the cash it needs to pay back creditors in just a few days.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The firm told recipients of political contributions and other donations that they have until Feb. 28 to return the money. FTX and its former executives doled out approximately $93 million to political causes over the last several years, bankruptcy court filings show, and lawmakers and political groups are expected to give much of the money back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","A trio of major Democratic groups, including the Democratic National Committee, have already set aside more than $1 million in contributions to return to the bankruptcy estate.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The firm has also received approval to sell some assets, and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the FTX case has set up a public Twitter account and was cleared to use its chosen financial advising firm.","FTX\u2019s lawyers even used some newly-granted authority to put their own legal pressure on the former boss.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The FTX debtors asked the court for permission to serve subpoenas to Bankman-Fried and his family in an effort to gather additional information about the collapse of the company.
