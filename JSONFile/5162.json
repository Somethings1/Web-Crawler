However, as currently designed and proposed, they do not take into account the microstructure of operating such a payment system. A lack of short-term liquidity facilities, particularly those relatively insulated from market forces, introduces the risk that activity grows faster than the underlying base of currency can safely support.\"","\"The risk of payment system gridlock, particularly during periods of stress, could have serious macroeconomic consequences,\" the authors continue.","Looking at stablecoins as a whole, the report's authors notably remark that \"the world is absolutely ready for private money\u2013most of what we think of as fiat currency is already privately issued.\"","\"However, the likely regulatory and compliance required for stablecoins to, for example, be accepted as payment for liabilities to the central government would be significant,\" they go on to write.","Â© 2023 The Block.
