It\u2019s not a huge surprise. According to Mastercard\u2019s recent <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mastercard.com\/news\/perspectives\/2022\/digital-payment-landscape-2022\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">New Payments Index study<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> 93% of people surveyed have heard of cryptocurrencies. Digital assets like Bitcoin and even NFTs are becoming just another part of the financial landscape. So, it\u2019s no wonder that governments are looking into how they can play a role. Indeed, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/b2b.mastercard.com\/white-papers\/central-bank-digital-currencies\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">86% of central banks<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> report that they are actually weighing the merits of a CBDC.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But it\u2019s important that governments keep in mind that CBDCs are not always going to be the right solution. Fear of missing out isn\u2019t the best reason for a central bank to invest in a massive undertaking like creating a digital currency. Instead, central banks need to ask themselves: What problem are we trying to solve with a CBDC?<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So, for example, if the problem is that people don\u2019t have enough access to their country\u2019s central bank, then CBDCs may be an answer. But if the problem is one of, say, getting aid to people faster in the case of a disaster, something like a real-time payments system might make more sense as a solution.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As governments continue to evaluate whether they should create CBDCs, it\u2019s important that all initiatives adhere to four principles that will help serve the needs of consumers, preserve the health of the financial system and ensure that consumers continue to have access to a robust and innovative array of payment options. Mastercard outlined these principals <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/b2b.mastercard.com\/white-papers\/central-bank-digital-currencies\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in a recent white paper<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> on CBDCs.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Right tool for the job:<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Policy makers should compare the suitability of a CBDC with other forms of new payment infrastructures to find the approach that best fits their unique payment needs and lays the groundwork for future priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Interoperable and open acceptance:<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> CBDCs will be most impactful where they interoperate seamlessly across payment types and take advantage of existing networks to facilitate broad and frictionless merchant acceptance. Interoperability can strengthen the domestic payment ecosystem and reinforce the role of central bank money.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Two-tier with private sector participation:<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> CBDC architectures that include private sector participation offer the best opportunity for innovation, interoperability and sustainability. Private sector competition ensures that the central bank retains institutional governance of the core monetary infrastructure while relying on banks and fintechs to compete in the distribution of the CBDC and the development of innovative user experiences.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Consumer protection:<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Consumers should be confident that a CBDC provides the protections needed for in-person and online transactions, and they should also understand how those protections may differ from those offered by other payment methods. This will require a framework of standards and rules that safeguard the security of every transaction while ensuring that all parties are treated fairly and equitably.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There are places where we are already seeing these principles put into practice where a CBDC was the right solution for the problem. In 2020, the Bahamas introduced a CBDC called the Sand Dollar. After the devastation of Hurricane Dorian, which <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mastercard.com\/news\/perspectives\/2021\/the-bahamas-is-disaster-proofing-payments-with-its-first-ever-digital-currency\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">killed dozens and caused $3 billion<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in damages, and the economic impact of the pandemic, the government decided it needed a bold new way to help citizens. Bahamas residents tend to be very reliant on cash. But when banks and ATMs are impacted by disasters, it becomes incredibly difficult for people to access their cash and receive government help.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Because restoring phone service is often easier than restoring electricity, a CBDC offers a way for residents to easily access money from their phones. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/b2b.mastercard.com\/white-papers\/central-bank-digital-currencies\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mastercard partnered<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> with Island Pay, which works with the Central Bank of the Bahamas, to offer a prepaid card that gives users the option to pay using Sand Dollars or to convert those Sand Dollars to traditional Bahamas dollars to pay for goods and services wherever Mastercard is accepted. That flexibility means that if a merchant doesn\u2019t accept Sand Dollars yet, the user can still make their purchase with the prepaid card.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As central banks continue to explore CBDCs, it\u2019s important they keep these kinds of private-public partnerships top of mind. Companies like Mastercard, which has had global acceptance for billions of cards and more than 90 million acceptance locations around the world, can help central banks evaluate their future payments plans and, if a CBDC is truly the right solution, help them build out the infrastructure needed for a new digital currency that lets people pay for goods and services how they want, where they want.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
