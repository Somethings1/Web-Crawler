Buterin was concerned about re-staking, a mechanism being developed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/208015\/eigenlayer-series-a-round\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Eigen Layer<\/a>, among others, which broadens the responsibilities of Ethereum validators to include securing external chains. He was worried that re-staking might introduce risks that could affect the safety of the network.","\u201CWe should tread lightly when application-layer projects aim to extend the \u2018scope\u2019 of blockchain consensus beyond the validation of essential Ethereum protocol rules,\u201D Buterin stated in the post.","In Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-stake model, validators are selected based on the number of ether they hold and are willing to stake. The network has the largest validator set among all proof-of-stake chains, both in terms of the number of validator entities and the total value of staked ether, some 18 million ETH (~$34 billion). This considerable size has prompted the development of systems to leverage this network security to secure third-party chains. However, Buterin advocated for a cautious approach.","Buterin noted that while re-staking can be used for low-risk purposes, there are situations where it could compromise the mainnet\u2019s security, such as when Ethereum validators face slashing on third-party chains. Slashing is a punitive measure for validators who engage in undesirable activities, like improperly maintaining their stake or incorrectly processing transactions.","\u201CWe should instead preserve the chain\u2019s minimalism and support uses of re-staking that do not seem like slippery slopes towards extending the role of Ethereum consensus,\u201D Buterin suggested.","Buterin\u2019s comments elicited responses from Sreeram Kannan, co-founder of Eigen Layer. Kannan agreed with Buterin\u2019s analysis and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sreeramkannan\/status\/1660388939369431042\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acknowledged<\/a> that Eigen Layer should avoid building complex financial primitives with the help of re-staking, as they \u201Ccan spiral out of control.\u201D Nevertheless, he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sreeramkannan\/status\/1660388940623515648\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> that re-staking can be used for \u201Clow-risk\u201D scenarios.","Kannan agreed that Eigen Layer can extend the functionality of validators beyond Ethereum but said these should be developed without the need for \u201Cslashing,\u201D which would introduce unnecessary complexity. He further emphasized that Eigen Layer is cautious about not impacting Ethereum\u2019s security in any way, aligning with Buterin\u2019s blog post.","Buterin discussed a 2015 <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.gnosis.io\/t\/the-ultimate-oracle\/61\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal<\/a> from Martin Köppelmann, the co-founder of Gnosis, for an \u201Cultimate oracle,\u201D deriving security from ETH stake. In the context of smart contracts, oracles are vital as they supply off-chain data. However, Buterin said that if the security of these data feeds were intertwined with Ethereum\u2019s stake, it might contribute to increased complexity.&nbsp;","Buterin suggested that such expanded roles or \u201Cduties\u201D added to Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism could magnify the challenges and risks involved in operating as a validator. He emphasized, \u201CValidators are required to exert significant human effort in terms of monitoring, running, and updating additional software to ensure their adherence to any newly implemented protocols.\u201D&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
