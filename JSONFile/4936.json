By contrast, newer institutional clients appear less interested, on the margin, in idiosyncratic effects such as on-chain developments.\"","The world's largest digital asset was changing hands for $29,457 at 11:30 a.m. ET, down 1% over the past 24 hours, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinGecko. <\/a>","The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that inflation, as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index, rose to 3.2% on a yearly basis in July from 3% in June. Core CPI inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in lower at 4.7% in July from 4.8% in June.&nbsp;","Some analysts are betting Thursday's reading could cause the Federal Reserve to pause rate hikes, though there are factors influencing the inflation rate beyond monetary policy. Natural gas, gasoline and crude oil costs have risen this month, which adds price pressure across all supply chains.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
