TBDs are traditional bank deposits represented as digital tokens on a blockchain network. Bank deposits as a backing mechanism may reduce market volatility and inspire greater confidence in TBDs as they are backed by underlying assets of a bank that is typically covered by deposit insurance schemes. Furthermore, TBDs could address regulatory bottlenecks since they may be largely in scope of extant bank regulatory frameworks. TBDs may therefore be in a sweet spot to address a \u2018stablecoin trilemma\u2019, which forces regulators to choose between i) stifling innovation, ii) allowing stablecoin issuers to become the new banks, or iii) financial stability risks.<\/span>","The Stablecoin Trilemma Source: S&amp;P Global Ratings","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Panelists discussed how future payment methods, whether CBDCs, stablecoins or TBDs, must focus on building frictionless \u2018payment journeys\u2019, whilst ensuring safety and consumer protection such as privacy.

Indeed, panelists exchanged views on the impact of critical failures such as FTX in the crypto space, and the potential regulatory gaps which may stifle innovation and represent a barrier to entry for legitimate market participants. Regulatory standards can also address fragmentation and lack of interoperability across various technology architectures, which may have a detrimental impact on adoption and scaling.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A major challenge to interoperability <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">within jurisdictions<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> lies in interfacing DLT and existing payment infrastructures. Such integrations may require significant overhaul of the current payment infrastructure, which is often complex and rigid. To overcome this challenge, panelists discussed the need for central banks, FinTech and traditional financial institutions to collaborate and support legal and regulatory approaches that would enable the integration of DLT within existing payment systems and (upcoming) CBDCs.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One promising example mentioned during the panelists\u2019 discussion is how open banking, whose introduction in the United Kingdom benefited from regulatory standard setting, may address interoperability issues <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">within jurisdictions<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. At the same time, it may also offer potential opportunities for addressing trust and digital identity issues when combined with DLT.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Furthermore, regulation may help overcome fragmentation in international payments and foster interoperability by promoting consistency and harmonization <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">between jurisdictions<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. By aligning rules and standards, regulators can create a level playing field for all market participants. This, in turn, encourages collaboration between different systems, such as CBDCs, commercial bank money, and the wider digital asset ecosystem. Internationally harmonized regulations, balancing innovation with consumer protection and financial stability, are essential to deliver the best outcomes for payment users and fully harness the potential of digital assets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Regulators may opt for the same regime as traditional financial players, arguing that the same activity should be subject to the same regulation. Alternatively, regulators may develop more tailored regulatory regimes to address specific facets that come with the new technologies, such as decentralization and pseudonymity. As DLT integrates into traditional finance, it is key for policymakers to align the level of regulatory oversight of crypto firms with that of traditional financial services providers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"<\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There is a clear thrust to bring digital assets into mainstream financial services regulation.
