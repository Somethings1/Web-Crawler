That would be misleading and foolish!\u201D said R3\u2019s chief communications officer Charley Cooper, in response to questions from The Block.","\u201CSo for the bigger picture, R3 is fortunate to be in a very strong cash position. We can confirm the company is not in an overall debt position,\u201D he added.","R3\u2019s New York-headquartered parent company is privately held and does not report annual performance numbers.","In the UK, R3 Limited saw revenues fall 35.6% on the previous year to just over £13m, while costs increased significantly, according to annual accounts covering the 12 months to December 31, 2019, published on October 6. Headcount alone grew from 109 at the end of 2018 to 162 by the end of the following year, raising staff costs 35% to £19.8m.","The UK company also reported £58.2m in debt coming due within one year of December 31, 2019. On the same date, it held roughly £25.2m in cash.","R3 Limited\u2019s annual report states that the UK business\u2019s turnover fell as the result of a change in accounting methodology following a Transfer Pricing study by Deloitte. R3 Limited switched from a \u201Ccost-plus basis\u201D in 2018 to a \u201Cprofit\/loss split\u201D with R3 LLC, a US subsidiary of parent company R3 Holdco LLC, in 2019.","In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bdo.global\/en-gb\/insights\/tax\/transfer-pricing\/react-profit-splits-and-cost-sharing-what-about-losses\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a recent post<\/a> on such accounting methods, BDO Global explains that profit splits \u201Care typically implemented when the participating parties to an intercompany transaction both (or all) own significant intangibles that are put to use as part of the transaction\u201D, adding that a similar arrangement can apply to cost arrangements.","R3\u2019s private blockchain platform Corda serves as the bedrock for many of Europe\u2019s best-known enterprise blockchain pilot programmes, in addition to supporting the efforts of a number of central banks which are exploring the development of central bank digital currencies.","High profile projects running on Corda include Switzerland\u2019s SIX Group long-awaited digital assets exchange, the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/80730\/italian-banks-r3-corda\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Spunta interbank reconciliation system<\/a> in Italy and Sweden\u2019s CBDC pilot.","R3 began life in 2015 as a project backed by a consortium of global banks, but later morphed into a private business. The company raised $107m from a number of big banks and Intel, the technology firm, in May 2017."],"hashtag":[]}
