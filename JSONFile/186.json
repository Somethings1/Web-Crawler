In doing so, the Court rejects the approach recently adopted by another judge of this District in a similar case,\" Rakoff wrote, directly citing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239559\/sec-faces-wake-up-call-after-ripple-ruling-though-appeal-likely\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple decision<\/a>.&nbsp;","Rakoff, who presides in the same district court as where the Ripple case was heard and partially decided, also rejected other attempts by Terraform and Kwon to quash the SEC\u2019s case against them.","Terrform\u2019s lawyers also cited the major questions doctrine, a legal argument that\u2019s gaining popularity around the industry, as cause to dismiss the SEC\u2019s case. The doctrine essentially says that regulatory agencies cannot act in areas of major economic or political significance unless Congress weighs in.","Rakoff rejected that argument as well.","\u201CBecause the doctrine is reserved for the most extraordinary cases where the agency claims broad regulatory authority and the area to be regulated is one invested with particular economic and political significance, it has been rarely invoked,\u201D Rakoff writes in his decision on the motion to dismiss, issued Monday. \u201CWith this standard in mind, the crypto-currency industry \u2013 though certainly important \u2013 falls far short of being a \u2018portion of the American economy\u2019 bearing \u2018vast economic and political significance.\u2019\u201D","Rakoff added that restricting the SEC to only regulating investment products that labels themselves as securities would be, \u201Cthe exact opposite of what Congress intended,\u201D in passing securities laws currently on the books.","In sum, there is no indication that Congress intended to hamstring the SEC\u2019s ability to resolve new and difficult questions posed by emerging technologies where these technologies impact markets that on their face appear to resemble securities markets,\u201D Rakoff concluded.&nbsp; Defendants cannot wield a doctrine intended to be applied in exceptional circumstances as a tool to disrupt the routine work that Congress expected the SEC and other administrative agencies to perform.\u201D","&nbsp;Rakoff also said that the SEC has made plausible arguments that Terraform\u2019s digital assets and the sales of them are securities offerings, and agreed that the SEC had jurisdiction to bring the case.","Still, lawyers for Terraform won a minor victory in a separate court on Monday. A federal bankruptcy judge <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/242374\/terraform-allowed-to-subpoena-ftx-over-terra-luna-short-sellers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">allowed a subpoena of wallets and account information from FTX<\/a>, relating to possible short sellers of Terra\/Luna, to move forward. Terraform says that information, which lawyers for FTX have also agreed to provide, will aid their defense against an SEC claim that Terraform conspired with Jump Trading to prop up the price of UST in 2021, a year before its collapse.
