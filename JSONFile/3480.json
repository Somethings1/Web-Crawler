The cash will be directed to European startups seeking Series A capital across a range of sectors including consumer, cybersecurity, developer tools, enterprise software-as-a-service, fintech and marketplaces. But a full third of the capital will be invested in crypto-powered firms, according to the company\u2019s announcement.","\u201CWe do hold tokens. We will have exposure to the core protocols,\u201D says Ophelia Brown, managing partner of Blossom Capital. \u201CWe are going to do a lot more of what we have already done.\u201D","Blossom does not appear to have much of a track record backing crypto businesses \u2014 save for its investment in MoonPay, which it backed in November last year when the crypto payments firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/124980\/moonpay-raise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $555 million<\/a> at a $3.4 billion valuation.","But Brown says Blossom\u2019s $185 million-sized second fund has quietly been investing in tokens and even NFTs, without showcasing those bets in the way a standard equity investment would be. The company has invested a lot of time and resources in developing the infrastructure needed to invest in web3 organizations, she adds.","\u201CWe have some NFTs \u2014 we won\u2019t disclose what, but we have NFTs,\u201D says Brown. \u201CWe believe in the upside of some of these communities very much.\u201D","Blossom\u2019s&nbsp;efforts in the sector will be steered by a new crypto-focused partner, a role the company is now actively trying to fill.","Brown herself is focused on the firm\u2019s fintech bets. Notably, she steered Blossom\u2019s investment in Checkout.com when the payments startup raised $230 million in May 2019. Checkout.com\u2019s value has ballooned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=checkout.com+the+block&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">from $2 billion to $40 billion<\/a> since then.","This is not to say that Brown isn\u2019t a crypto enthusiast. She says she tried, unsuccessfully, to get Index Ventures to buy into Ethereum\u2019s presale in 2014 while working as a principal at the investment firm. Her profile picture on Twitter is <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/assets\/0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb\/985\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CryptoPunk #985<\/a>, which she appears to have purchased in December for 98 ether (or around $320,000 at today\u2019s prices), based on OpenSea records.","Brown says that getting Blossom\u2019s own backers \u2014 its limited partners (LPs) \u2014 on board for greater crypto exposure wasn't an issue for the firm. Indeed, while the majority of the second fund\u2019s LPs are again backing Blossom\u2019s third, the company has also brought in some of the world\u2019s biggest endowment funds.","\u201CThe best allocators are already positive on crypto,\u201D says Brown."],"hashtag":[]}
