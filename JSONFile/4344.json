Now Gu\u2019s firm is launching the testnet of its own blockchain to be \u201Cthe security infrastructure to all other blockchains,\u201D he told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Backed by Binance Labs, Bitmain, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and others, the CertiK Foundation is already running a successful security auditing business that pre-dates its blockchain project. However, Gu said that its goal from the beginning was to establish an independent, completely secured blockchain.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gu explained that during security auditing, the CertiK Foundation can ensure that parts of the blockchain are functioning correctly, but it cannot guarantee every piece of the blockchain architecture is secured. The CertiK chain, in comparison, hopes to develop a blockchain from ground up that is mathematically proven infallible, a process known as Formal Verification.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere are still many facets in this software\u2026 any single bug in any of these layers can compromise the entire system. That\u2019s why we feel like although the services provided by the CertiK company is very useful, it still can\u2019t solve the problem from the root. The CertiK Chain is the more foundational and better solution,\u201D said Gu.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the heart of the CertiK Chain is the DeepSEA language, which was born out of the research labs at Columbia and Yale Universities. Designed to suit the security needs of the CertiK Chain, the program allows developers\u2013\u2013even those less familiar with Formal Verification\u2013\u2013to write Formally Verified smart contracts.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To be sure, there are many public blockchain projects out there, and some, like CertiK, also have an academic spin. For example, Gu\u2019s long-time friend Fan Long, a computer science professor at the University of Toronto, is leading a public blockchain project named Conflux that has raised <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/darrynpollock\/2018\/12\/04\/notable-investors-pursuing-dapp-protocol-conflux-despite-market-concern\/#6e0020a1a2c7\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">over $35 million<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> from Sequoia China, Metastable, among others. Cryptocurrency exchange giants Binance and Huobi Global are also testing their own public blockchains.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Faced with heated competition, the CertiK Chain is betting that its security feature and ability to be integrated with existing blockchains will help the firm stand out.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAs long as there are some dApps that have very high security requirements, even if those are running on other blockchains, they can still deploy the security features provided by the CertiK Chain with our cross-chain technique,\u201D said Gu.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The company is also in a financially strong position to realize its vision. Besides the venture funding it received last year, the company also conducted a private token sale, raising an undisclosed amount. In addition, its security auditing business is already profitable, a rare scene in the overall startup world, especially for a company in the testnet stage of its blockchain project.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThose services [security auditing] are valuable and terrific, and the CertiK Chain is able to really give that ability out to programmers at scale from the ground up,\u201D said the CertiK Foundation Head of Marketing Lev Novak.<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
