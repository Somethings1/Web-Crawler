We\u2019ve created an elegant software and hardware integration that offers more functionality than previously existed in our space. We\u2019re thrilled to offer the Lockbox to Blockchain users so they can easily manage their funds online and offline seamlessly,\u201D said Peter Smith, CEO, and Co-Founder of Blockchain.","\u201CWith stories about crypto hacking continuing to dominate headlines, it\u2019s obvious that security must be top of mind for all stakeholders in the crypto space,\u201D said Pascal Gauthier, President of Ledger.","As a part of their announcement, Blockchain is also unveiling its Swap, a new trading and liquidity product for Blockchain users. Users can access Swap to exchange cryptoassets directly from their hardware devices and Blockchain Wallet. \"You'll be able to trade directly from the Lockbox now at high-limits. So you'll be able to just go on, you do one link with your ledger, make the trade, you'll get a notification on your app on your phone that the trade has completed when it is completed,\" said Smith.&nbsp;Existing users and owners of Ledger devices will be able to pair their device to the Blockchain Wallet to access the user interface and Swap features provided by Blockchain.","Blockchain's partnership with Ledger comes at a time when Trezor, Ledger's closest competitor in the hardware wallet space, is also ramping up the add-on services it provides. Most recently, Trezor <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/trezor-users-can-now-exchange-cryptoassets-directly-in-their-wallet\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced the release of its \"Exchanges\"<\/a>&nbsp;feature, which enables Trezors&nbsp;users to trade cryptoassets directly from their Trezor devices.&nbsp;Still, Blockchain\u2018s new offering is unique because it leverages a large network of liquidity providers beyond just crypto exchanges. According to Smith, this enables Blockchain's users to get access to the best possible prices for their assets.","Blockchain has recently experimented with a host of new offerings including an <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.blockchain.com\/2018\/06\/28\/blockchain-launches-institutional-product-blockchain-principal-strategies\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">institutional&nbsp;data and research platform <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/cryptocurrency-wallet-provider-blockchain-announces-airdrop-program\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an Airdrop services<\/a>. The release of Lockbox and Swap shows the company\u2019s push to become more than a software cryptoasset wallet.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
