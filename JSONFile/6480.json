Last year it felt like an absolute circus\u2014over the top parties, actresses buying crypto, conferences at massive venues\u2014and now a lot of that has quieted down, and 90% of the speculators have exited the scene. The people who are left are grizzled veterans, who\u2019ve survived the receding wave of speculation and also the total shutdown of fiat exchanges in China. The number one thing that strikes me every time I come here is how many people think purely in terms of stacking Bitcoin (and a few premium alts) rather than in terms of accumulating more fiat money.","There are also a lot more truly interesting projects coming out of China these days. I was initially skeptical that the crypto scene would truly end up Asia-centered as a result of the US regulatory environment being so hostile (a skepticism shared by a lot of my Chinese crypto friends) but these days I am beginning to think that will actually come to pass. The hardware (miners), infrastructure (mining installations), and financial institutions (the crypto exchanges) are all here, and that ends up creating a fertile ground for new projects. The number one blocker to this in my opinion was the lure of cheap cash via ICO, but that seems to have come and gone, and now there are a lot of very technical and interesting teams here building stuff. Over the next few issues I\u2019m going to discuss a few of the best ones in detail!","More next week, thanks as always for reading!","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinops.org\/en\/newsletters\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BitcoinOptech<\/a> on Bitcoin<\/strong>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Proposed new opcode for transaction output commitments:<\/strong>&nbsp;Jeremy Rubin posted to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list a proposal to soft fork in an&nbsp;<code data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY<\/code>&nbsp;opcode that allows a Bitcoin address to require the transaction spending it include a certain set of outputs.

Also, although the change may simplify development for anyone writing scripts by hand, it\u2019s a bit risky as every development guide to Script written to date teaches that scripts must terminate with a&nbsp;<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">true<\/em>value on the stack.

However, because a valid pubkey must be on the elliptic curve, it\u2019s possible to find both valid Y coordinates (one odd, one even) for any given X coordinate given the curve formula. In compressed key format, the first byte contains a single bit to specify whether the Y coordinate is odd or even, followed by 32 bytes to encode the X coordinate. The proposed bip-taproot followed this convention and used 33 bytes to encode the taproot output key.","This week, John Newbery&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/lists.linuxfoundation.org\/pipermail\/bitcoin-dev\/2019-May\/016943.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suggested<\/a>&nbsp;that we use some method to avoid placing this byte in the scriptPubKey. Wuille agreed that this could be useful and will attempt implementing a variation where the bit will be included as part of the taproot witness data.
