On top of targeting former FTX\/Alameda leadership, separate suits also seek to claw back funds from Embed\u2019s founder and former CEO Michael Giles, as well as early investors who sold their stakes to Bankman-Fried and company, including Propel Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that has backed several other notable tech startups, including Coinbase and Docusign.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Unlike Bankman-Fried and others, Giles and Embed shareholders named in a parallel separate suit are not accused of criminal wrongdoing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lawyers representing the failed FTX crypto empire want to claw back money on the grounds that Alameda was already insolvent when it finalized the deal in late September, and that the investment fund and sister company West Realm Shires, also controlled by Bankman-Fried, paid an inflated price for Embed. The suits are an attempt to maximize pay back to FTX and Alameda\u2019s own creditors within the bankruptcy process.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aside from allegations of fraud and self-dealing using customer funds \u2013 also alleged in criminal proceedings brought by U.S. prosecutors \u2013 FTX\u2019s bankruptcy stewards also accuse Bankman-Fried and company of making a terrible deal. Lawyers representing FTX in the bankruptcy process put Embed up for bidding but now say that the platform is near-worthless compared to what Bankman-Fried and company paid for it.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On June 27, after the acquisition was agreed to but had not been finalized, two senior employees noted in internal messages quoted in the filing that \u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Embed platform\u2019s inability to handle approximately 600 new user accounts as part of the gradual release of FTX Stocks,\u201D though a release plan called for Embed to handle 10,000 new accounts.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The company had approximately $37 million in assets and made $25,000 profit as of March 31, 2022, the filing claims.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On top of that the company gave Embed\u2019s founder and CEO, named in a separate suit along with other equity holders who sold their stakes to Alameda, a $55 million retention bonus, to be paid in five installments beginning on Sept. 30, 2022, that did not require him to stay with the company past deal closing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThey performed almost no due diligence on Embed and accepted the significant terms proposed by Giles, Embed\u2019s founder, CEO, and sole representative during the negotiation, who personally received approximately $157 million in connection with the acquisition,\u201D FTX bankruptcy lawyers argue. \u201CAs a consequence, WRS paid far more than fair or reasonably equivalent value for Embed, and awarded Giles an extravagant and unwarranted retention bonus as an incentive to complete the acquisition quickly.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX\u2019s bankruptcy representatives argue that the retention bonus was an \u201Cunusual arrangement\u201D because it only tied Giles to Embed through the closing of the deal, rather than keeping him on to run the company afterwards. He also received over $100 million for his equity as Embed\u2019s largest shareholder.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In communications between Embed employees, included as part of the lawsuit filing, two of them note the speed that Alameda hoped to close the deal while talking about whether they needed to prep for any sort of due diligence around the purchase.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI get a sense that they are [cowboy emoji] over there[.],\u201D replied one.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX\u2019s lawyers say that after trying to sell the company only months after the acquisition of Embed, no one wants to buy it for anywhere near what Bankman-Fried and others paid for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Giles himself submitted the highest bid during a process held earlier this year, seeking to buy back the company for $1 million \u201Csubject to potential reductions at closing.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Giles did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe result of the bidding process\u2014including Giles\u2019 own bid of $1 million, or 0.45% of the purchase price that WRS had paid just a few months before\u2014leaves no doubt that the $220 million paid by WRS to acquire Embed was wildly inflated relative to the company\u2019s fair value, which Giles well knew,\u201D lawyers representing FTX\u2019s caretaker leadership argue in the suit. \u201CThe bidders had figured out what the FTX Group and FTXInsiders did not bother to assess prior to the Embed acquisition, namely, that Embed\u2019s vaunted software platform was essentially worthless.\u201D<\/span>"],"hashtag":["CRIME","FTX","LAWSUITS","SAM BANKMAN-FRIED"]}
