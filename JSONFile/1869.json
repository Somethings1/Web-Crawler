When asked how Anchorage\u2019s platform differs from Coinbase Custody\u2019s, Monica told The Block that \"Coinbase\u2019s model involves moving assets from a cold storage key into a proxy smart contract, which is controlled by a hot wallet...and is more exposed to risk,\u201D while \u201Cour model does not use hot wallets or cold storage, and therefore we do not need to use a proxy smart contract.\u201D","Anchorage further said that it uses a multi-user approval system for its voting platform to ensure that a given vote reflects an organization\u2019s wishes and not just the whims of an individual employee.","With on-chain governance becoming \u201Cincreasingly common\" with protocols like Tezos, EOS, Dash and others, Anchorage said it will support \u201Cmany more\u201D crypto assets in the future. When asked for specific details, Monica told The Block: \u201CRight now we\u2019re highly focused on supporting several major new projects that are yet to launch, so that our clients will be supported on day one.\u201D","Anchorage is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/30631\/visa-blockchain-capital-back-40-million-round-for-crypto-custodian-anchorage\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">backed<\/a> by notable investors, including Visa, a16z and Blockchain Capital, all three participating in its $40 million Series A in July. The total funding raised by Anchorage to date is $57 million, Monica told The Block.","There are now 50 employees working for Anchorage; that number was around 25 last year, and Monica said the firm is currently hiring for over 15 more roles."],"hashtag":["DAI"]}
