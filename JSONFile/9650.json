Last year, when Bitcoin was over $40,000, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.miamibull.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a giant metal bull<\/a> greeted visitors to the <a href=\"https:\/\/b.tc\/conference\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">annual Bitcoin conference<\/a> in Miami, proclaiming that the \u201Cfuture of finance\u201D had arrived. A year later, and well into a fresh crypto winter, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pepecoineth?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pepe<\/a> seems to have taken over.","In the first day of the three-day event, the mood was somewhat subdued as crowds trickled in to hear panel discussions such as \u201CThe Fed vs. The Financial System,\u201D \u201CFighting the Anti-Crypto Army\u201D and \u201CBitcoin &amp; The Banking Crisis.\u201D The mood was serious, yet hopeful. But the real star of the show was Pepe, whose omnipresence coincides with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229907\/pepes-no-different-where-theres-a-meme-theres-a-scam\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">memecoin<\/a> that caused a frenzy when it hit the market in mid-April.","Off to the side of the large expo hall at the conference, an art gallery featured both physical and digital art, some of which could be purchased in an ongoing auction using bitcoin.","The <a href=\"https:\/\/scarce.city\/auctions\/pepernica-original-painting\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">show stopper<\/a> is a massive, 21-panel mural that pays meme homage to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.museoreinasofia.es\/en\/collection\/artwork\/guernica\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Picasso\u2019s Guernica<\/a>, the famed 1937 oil painting that became a symbol of the Spanish Civil War. Dubbed Pepernica, the painting by artist <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/simo_eth\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Luis Simo<\/a> is over 11 feet tall and 25 feet long. The current bid is 5.5 millions sats, or nearly $1,500.","Simo, a 27-year-old visual artist based in Valencia, Spain, said the mural took him about a month and a half to paint. He said he first had the idea after attending the Bitcoin conference last year and had been inspired by the subsequent crypto market crash and the war in Ukraine.","\"Memes are a reoccurring part of the art world,\" he said in an interview. \"If you go to museums and galleries in the U.S. and Europe, you'll easily see memes. But to introduce memes from Crypto Twitter into physical art and installations, that's just getting started.\"","\"It would be great if it goes to someone with the space to exhibit it,\" Simo continued, adding that he thought a hotel would be the perfect place for the work. He plans to keep the bitcoin he receives from the sale.&nbsp;","Another work by <a href=\"https:\/\/luissimoart.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Simo<\/a> called \u201CLas Pepinas\u201D is an original oil painting that memes Diego Velázquez\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Las_Meninas\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Las Meninas<\/a> (The Ladies-in-Waiting).
