Such increasing realization and the key technologies mentioned above \u201Ctogether present us with an opportunity to take things in a different direction,\u201D Buterin wrote.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Zero-knowledge proofs and their increasing developer-friendliness open new possibilities for consumer applications and privacy-preserving technologies, according to Buterin.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Buterin envisions a future where Ethereum becomes a hub for a range of applications \u2014 from decentralized social media to secure, anonymous voting systems.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThese technologies are most widely adopted as ways of improving Ethereum's scalability, as ZK rollups, but they are also very useful for privacy,\u201D he continued.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIn particular, the programmability of zero-knowledge proofs means that we can get past the false binary of \u2018anonymous but risky\u2019 vs \u2018KYC'd therefore safe,\u2019 and get privacy and many kinds of authentication and verification at the same time,\u201D he added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Buterin also urged the Ethereum community to follow the core values \u2014 open global participation, decentralization, censorship resistance, auditability, credible neutrality, cooperative mindset and tool building.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt is very possible to build things within the crypto ecosystem that do not follow these values,\u201D he said. \u201COne can build a system that one calls a \u2018layer 2,\u2019 but which is actually a highly centralized system secured by a multisig, with no plans to ever switch to something more secure.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CResisting these pressures is hard, but if we do not do so, then we risk losing the unique value of the crypto ecosystem, and recreating a clone of the existing web2 ecosystem with extra inefficiencies and extra steps,\u201D he added.<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
