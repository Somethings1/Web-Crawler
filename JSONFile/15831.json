{"summary":"The crypto industry has its first federally chartered bank: Anchorage.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/policy\/2021\/01\/13\/anchorage-becomes-first-occ-approved-national-crypto-bank\/","publishDate":"2021-01-13T19:34:58","id":15831,"type":null,"title":"Anchorage Becomes First OCC-Approved National Crypto Bank","category":["Policy"],"content":["","Crypto custodian Anchorage has secured conditional approval for a national trust charter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), making it the first national \u201Cdigital asset bank\u201D in the U.S.","","","The safekeeping, management and trading of digital assets have been regulatory stumbling blocks for large financial institutions \u2013 but those obstacles are gradually being removed. The OCC, a part of the Treasury Department charged with keeping banks safe but also competitive, has now issued three interpretative letters that lay the groundwork for banks to custody crypto, participate in blockchain networks and become payment providers using the tech.","","","\"In granting this charter, the OCC applied the same rigorous review and standards applied to all charter applications,\" the bank regulator said in a statement. \"By bringing this applicant into the federal banking system, the bank and industry will benefit from the OCC\u2019s extensive supervisory experience and expertise.\"","","","\u201CWe are a national bank. The only difference is our business line, that we\u2019re doing crypto assets versus doing other assets,\u201D Anchorage President Diogo Mónica said in an interview. \u201CThe benefit of having a federally chartered bank is that it preempts all the state laws. The clarity of being regulated by the oldest regulator for banks in the United States \u2026 sends a very clear message.\u201D","","","Acting OCC chief Brian Brooks, speaking at a public event earlier Wednesday, expressed his belief that banks and financial services more broadly will transition to being blockchain-based.","","","\u201CI think what\u2019s necessary is the creation of crypto banks that are able to hold stablecoins that reflect value of a fiat currency, but that doesn\u2019t change the native asset, and you need to have real cryptocurrencies over here where they interact directly with each other, with no need to ever off-ramp,\u201D Brooks said. \u201CFiat will ultimately be a legacy thing of the past.\u201D","","","Anchorage\u2019s trust company unit first applied for a national charter from the OCC last November, and it joins Kraken and Avanti in being crypto-native banks, although the latter two are special-purpose depository institutions organized under Wyoming state law. Fellow crypto startups BitPay and Paxos have also applied for federal charters through the OCC.","","","The new bank is being ushered in under the auspices of Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks, who\u2019s headed up the regulator since this past summer. It\u2019s the capstone to a multi-month effort to bring the crypto industry closer to the traditional banking world.","","","\u201CBlockchains, fundamentally, are banking because what they\u2019re doing is allowing the transaction of value across networks,\u201D Brooks said at Wednesday\u2019s event. \u201CThey\u2019re [just] doing it in an orthogonally different way.\u201D","","","During his tenure, Brooks, the former general counsel of Coinbase, has expressed his view that crypto startups may be better regulated under a federal framework, rather than at the state level.","","","\u201CWe\u2019ve had a dual banking system in this country for 150 years. There are many, many banks chartered by the states out there because it's the right business model for what they're focused on,\u201D Brooks told CoinDesk in June. \u201CIf you\u2019re focused on the local and regional business, it makes sense to have a state charter. If you\u2019re focused on a national business, it probably makes more sense to have a national charter.\u201D","","","Georgia Quinn, Anchorage\u2019s general counsel, told CoinDesk the process of applying for a national charter was made easier by the fact that the startup was already operating as a registered trust company in South Dakota.","","","\u201CWe were already a state-chartered bank and so already had an operating history and a lot of the relevant procedures and policies in place so it wasn\u2019t a de novo application, it was just the conversion of a state trust into a national trust,\u201D she said. \u201CI really can\u2019t stress enough the advantage we had from already operating as a trust company.\u201D","","","Granting crypto companies a bank charter has been a stated goal for Brooks since May, when the then\u2013First Deputy Comptroller told an audience at CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus: Distributed that in his view, \u201Cit looks a lot like crypto is banking for the 21st century.\u201D","","","The advantages are clear: rather than require companies to apply for 49 state money transmitter licenses piecemeal, a national charter will allow businesses to operate throughout the country at once. ","","","It also lets Anchorage develop new services, Mónica and co-founder Nathan McCauley told CoinDesk.","","","\u201CIt means that there\u2019s a crypto-native company that offers crypto services like lending, staking and now it\u2019s allowed to actually be connected directly to the core of the financial system,\u201D Mónica said. \u201CWe can go out and do all sorts of businesses, wrapped assets that financial institutions can do today, but backed by crypto assets.\u201D","","","Anchorage stated in a blog post accompanying the announcement that its new federally chartered bank \u201Cunequivocally will meet the definition of Qualified Custodian.\u201D","","","Qualified custodians are legal entities in the U.S. that maintain client funds and hold securities in specific, defined ways. Federal regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can designate entities as qualified custodians, while state regulators cannot. ","","","Crypto companies have long had issues becoming qualified custodians, due to questions about how digital asset service providers can comply with aspects of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 \u2013 specifically, how brokers can prove that no other entity has access to its own private keys. ","","","Mónica said any doubts around the management of cryptographic keys were now removed and this would pave the way for the largest, most risk-averse investors such as pension funds to enter the arena.","","","\u201CAside from crypto funds and hedge funds and VCs that are paid to take risk and to be on the bleeding edge, you have large institutions that are paid not to take risk,\u201D Mónica said. \u201CThis means all of the doubts are now solved and in black and white.\u201D","","","Kristin Smith, executive director of lobbying group the Blockchain Association, welcomed the news.","","","\u201CToday\u2019s announcement is a recognition that not only can banks engage with crypto, but that crypto companies can function as banks,\u201D Smith said in a statement. \u201CThis is the most important step yet towards the full modernization of our financial services system.\u201D","","","The news comes as Brooks is rumored to be planning his departure from the federal regulator later this week. While Brooks has been nominated to serve a full term heading up the agency by President Donald Trump, it is expected that incoming President Joe Biden will pull the nomination.","","","There is already legislator pushback against many of the letters Brooks has overseen, with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, asking Biden to ensure his nominees revoke many Trump-era rules and regulations, including all of the OCC\u2019s recent crypto guidance. ","","","A federal charter is one issue that would be more difficult for Brooks\u2019 successor to overturn. ","","","It\u2019s unclear who Biden will tap to lead the OCC. The President-elect has announced he will nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to be Treasury Secretary. The Senate Finance Committee will hold a confirmation hearing for her on Jan. 19, a day before Biden is sworn in.","","","Yellen or Biden could designate an acting comptroller to lead the agency until someone is nominated to fill a full five-year term. Brooks was initially appointed to the OCC by current Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.","","","Biden has reportedly nominated former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Gary Gensler to lead the SEC, perhaps indicating that he may look for someone with less of a deregulatory focus. ",""],"entity":[{"type":"Blockchain Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Georgia Quinn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Maxine Waters","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nathan McCauley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"OCC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"21st century","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Anchorage","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kristin Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Janet Yellen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Dakota","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Treasury Department","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brian Brooks","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u201D Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Joe Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"House Financial Services Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Steven Mnuchin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1970","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Diogo Mónica","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wyoming","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Senate Finance Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Brooks","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Donald Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Calif.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jan. 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fiat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Biden","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mónica","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Banking","Office of the Comptroller of the Currency","OCC","Anchorage","Crypto Custody"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De","Ian Allison"]}
