This has led to USDT losing its parity with the U.S. dollar amid the ongoing market tumult.","The Curve <a href=\"https:\/\/curve.fi\/#\/ethereum\/pools\/3pool\/deposit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">3pool<\/a> is the largest liquidity pool on the Curve decentralized exchange. This pool provides deep liquidity for swaps among the three largest stablecoins: USDT, USDC, and DAI. Under normal conditions, the pool is supposed to provide a capital-efficient means of swapping between any of the two stablecoins in the mix.","However, the fallout of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185163\/ftx-ceo-bankman-frieds-top-priority-fundraise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX collapse<\/a> has upended the balance of the pool. The stablecoin reserve breakdown shows Tether\u2019s share of the pool has risen to 86%, more than double the ideal percentage for USDT. This figure is also higher than it was during the Luna collapse when USDT accounted for 83% of the stablecoin pool.","Tether\u2019s dominance of the pool indicates massive swaps from USDT to the other two stablecoins. Tether has lost its U.S. dollar peg as a result of traders swapping USDT for USDC. The stablecoin fell about 2.5% below peg to $0.9750 earlier in the day but has since recovered slightly to trade at $0.9907 \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/184653\/tethers-usdt-falls-1-below-dollar-peg-amid-market-uncertainty\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">which is still 1% below peg<\/a> \u2014 as of the time of writing.","Tether\u2019s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/paoloardoino\/status\/1590671674378067968?s=20&amp;t=ZPGYQeHfMq2h2RBwRn5dRQ\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> earlier in the day that was no cause for concern. Ardoino stated that the stablecoin issuer has processed $700 million worth of redemptions in the last 24 hours.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
