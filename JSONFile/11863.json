Subnets can also use a token of their own design instead of AVAX.","\u201CIt\u2019s kind of like blockchain as a service,\u201D John Wu, president of Ava Labs, said in an interview with The Block. He added that subnets, while app-specific, retain \u201Call the power of Avalanche.\u201D","The launch puts Avalanche in competition with rivals Cosmos and Polkadot, blockchain operators that already offer similar functionality.","News of the Multiverse program comes after the creation of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/114782\/avalanche-launches-180-million-defi-incentive-scheme-aave-curve\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an $180 million program<\/a> in August of last year, named Avalanche Rush, which aimed to entice DeFi developers to the blockchain. Similar rewards packages have been dangled by Ethereum challengers Algorand, Hedera and Celo \u2014 and early signs suggest they have&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/118150\/ethereum-challengers-are-dangling-token-rewards-to-attract-big-name-defi-projects-and-its-working\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proven effective<\/a>.","In its latest announcement, the Avalanche Foundation highlighted two examples of subnet projects that are already under way: DeFi Kingdoms and an institutional DeFi initiative featuring half a dozen big-hitters in crypto.","The first subnet to receive incentives through the Multiverse program is NFT gaming project DeFi Kingdoms, for which $15 million in incentives has been set aside. Those rewards will be denominated in AVAX and a new DeFi Kingdoms token named CRYSTAL, which will sit alongside the game\u2019s existing JEWEL token.","In a statement, DeFi Kingdoms\u2019 pseudonymous executive director Frisky Fox said the team had been looking for technology to help the project \u201Cscale and introduce new features like using our native tokens for gas fees, without sacrificing security or decentralization.\u201D","Another key subnet project focuses on crafting regulatory-compliant access to DeFi for institutional investors.","Ava Labs, which helps drive the development of Avalanche, has partnered with Aave, GoldenTree Asset Management, Wintermute, Jump Crypto, Valkyrie, Securitize and others to build the subnet. Participants will be required to undergo know-your-customer (KYC) checks.","\u201CIn this case, a consortium can help govern who is participating in this subnet in order to stay compliant with the rules and regulations,\u201D said Wu.","Launched in September 2020, Avalanche is a proof-of-stake protocol that touts its smart contracts platform as the fastest in the blockchain space. In proof-of-stake systems, participants are required to stake tokens for the chance to be randomly selected to validate transactions.","Developers must stake 2,000 AVAX tokens (around $144,000 at current prices) to create and validate a subnet, according to Luigi D\u2019Onorio DeMeo, a director at Ava Labs.","For projects that qualify, the Multiverse initiative could cover that cost. But the program can also dish out rewards to subnet users and liquidity mining incentives, paid out to entities that stake tokens in order to help validate transactions in subnets.","The Avalanche Foundation said the Multiverse program will be divided into at least six phases to support multiple cohorts of projects.","Several subnets have already been created on Avalanche \u2014&nbsp;including one by Shrapnel, a first-person shooter game that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investing.com\/news\/cryptocurrency-news\/avalanche-to-introduce-its-first-aaa-game-on-its-blockchain-2777506\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recently raised<\/a> $10.5 million in funding. But DeFi Kingdoms is the first project to receive incentives under the Multiverse label, according to D\u2019Onorio DeMeo.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/scaling-solutions\/evm-chains-stats\/daily-new-unique-addresses-for-evm-chains\/embed\" title=\"Daily New Unique Addresses for EVM-Chains\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
