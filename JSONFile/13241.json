EY <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ey.com\/en_gl\/news\/2019\/12\/ey-releases-third-generation-zero-knowledge-proof-blockchain-technology-to-the-public-domain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> it will help make transactions more scalable by \u201Csignificantly\u201D reducing costs.","\u201CIn the prior iteration <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ey.com\/en_lu\/news\/2019\/04\/ey-releases-zero-knowledge-proof-blockchain-transaction-technology-to-the-public-domain-to-advance-blockchain-privacy-standards\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">released<\/a> in April 2019, public blockchains were already getting competitive with private networks. With this iteration, we cut the cost per transaction by more than 90% again, making private transactions more accessible for mainstream business application,\u201D said Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at EY.","Technically speaking, the new tool allows batching multiple private transfers together in a single transaction, which reduces the size on-chain, and in turn, transaction costs.","It allows for \u201Cup to 20 transactions to be done at once and cuts the cost per transaction to around US$0.05,\u201D said EY, adding that this represents a 400-fold improvement over its initial prototype <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ey.com\/en_gl\/news\/2018\/10\/ey-launches-the-world-s-first-secure-private-transactions-over-the-ethereu-public-blockchain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">released<\/a> in October 2018.","\u201CThis technology is perhaps the most important EY blockchain milestone in making public blockchains scalable for the enterprise,\u201D said Brody.","EY said the updated technology can also be deployed on private blockchains built on Ethereum. \u201COn private blockchains, it provides a second layer of security and privacy,\u201D it explained.","Looking ahead, EY is expected to announce more such improved functions. \u201CI believe we will look back upon the industrialization of ZKPs as a key milestone in the wide enterprise migration from private to public blockchains,\u201D said Brody, adding:<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201COrganizations are increasingly seeing the potential for public blockchains, with 75% of enterprises likely to use these networks in the future.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
