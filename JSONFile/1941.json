In Phase 0, however, the system will temporarily rely on Chainlink alone for reference prices.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Notably, the platform will also alter the way new codes get added to make sure that the whole ecosystem has more time to review them.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We will transition to an EIP-like system for cataloging new features and improvements to the protocol,\" Kistner wrote in the blog post. \"This will make the process of how new code gets added completely visible to the public. Features should not be added as a surprise or at the last moment. Rather, they should go through a lengthy public process so that all ecosystem participants are able to make themselves familiar with the state of the code.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Additionally, bZx will have its newly refactored code go through a security audit, formal verification, and an economic audit before the platform becomes fully functional again, according to Kistner.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We believe that full test coverage, static analysis, and formal verification could have all formed additional lines of defense against the very first attack that bypassed the safety check on collateralization,\" he said. \"We believe that an economic audit would have been particularly valuable in preventing the second attack.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We will never again publish unaudited code, no matter how few lines or trivial,\" he added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Regarding 1inch.exchange's complaint, Kistner apologized for the fact that bZx failed to pay the bug bounty right away.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Rather than simply pay the full bug bounty immediately, with extreme gratitude for finding such a serious exploit, we tried negotiating,\" he said. \"This was a serious mistake that we need to take responsibility for.
