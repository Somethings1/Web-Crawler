Kwon <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stablekwon\/status\/1506285059686473738\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">added<\/a> that the foundation will need another another $800 million to meet the $3 billion target.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This purchase will make up one leg of Terra's long-term plans of amassing $10 billion of bitcoin reserve for UST. Kwon explained that to get to that mark, the stablecoin may set aside a portion of the seigniorage \u2014 the protocol\u2019s revenue generated from issuing UST \u2014 to accumulate bitcoin.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kwon also commented that the foundation will create a \u201Cbridge\u201D to introduce billions of dollars worth of tokenized bitcoin onto Terra and use as reserves in the stablecoin protocol. The new mechanism may require a change in stablecoin\u2019s protocol \u2013 the details of which remain scant at the moment.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt's not 10B today - as UST money supply grows a portion of the seigniorage will go to build BTC reserves bridged to the Terra chain. We have 3B funds ready to seed this reserve, but technical infrastructure (bridges etc) is still not ready yet,\u201D Kwon <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stablekwon\/status\/1506278298883706882\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> yesterday.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Even though LFG or Kwon have not made an official announcement behind establishing a large bitcoin reserve, it\u2019s likely this is meant to strengthen UST's peg to the dollar.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">UST currently maintains its peg via an algorithm that burns or creates LUNA \u2013 the native cryptocurrency on the Terra blockchain. Unlike with centralized stablecoins, with UST no real dollars are held by the team for a 1:1 redemption. <\/span>","According to one <a href=\"https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3952045\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">research paper<\/a>, algorithmic stablecoins such as terra are \u201Cfragile\u201D because of their uncollateralized nature. Last week, Kwon stated in a Twitter Spaces <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/0xCha0s\/status\/1505010904802508800\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">discussion<\/a> that bitcoin can help UST maintain its dollar peg even when there are massive selloffs in the market.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By maintaining a large bitcoin reserve, LFG will make it possible users to redeem UST for bitcoin in an effort to instill confidence among UST holders.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
