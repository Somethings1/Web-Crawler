As part of the deal, Alameda agreed to sell back its 5% equity stake in LayerZero \u2014 worth $150 million at LayerZero\u2019s current valuation, the lawsuit notes \u2014&nbsp;in exchange for LayerZero forgiving a $45 million loan it had extended to Alameda.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The lawsuit argues that at the time of the transfers, the FTX empire was already insolvent, so the deals constitute fraud under the bankruptcy code and should be reversed for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alameda had also agreed to sell back to LayerZero 100 million of its Stargate (STG) tokens for $10 million.
