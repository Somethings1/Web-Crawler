Of the $25 billion VC funding [year to date], almost $4 billion came after Terra. Our best guess is the VC funding will continue and a long winter similar to 2018\/2019 would be averted,\u201D the report said. Yet if this funding dries up, a long winter could be on the cards, it noted.","The report also said that Terra's collapse has had limited knock-on effects on the rest of the DeFi ecosystem (despite calling it a \"significant blow to the crypto world\"). According to the bank, the Total Value Locked (TVL) in other DeFi projects appears to have been \u201Crelatively resilient\u201D to its demise. TVL is a figure used to represent the value of cryptocurrencies locked up in DeFi protocols.","While Terra's collapse did sour investor sentiment, this hasn\u2019t spilled over into other stablecoins. The report noted the differences between types of stablecoins, explaining that each design had a different risk-profile. It noted there was a modest pressure on the algorithmic stablecoin Frax and that Neutrino USD lost its peg.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The report highlighted that, according to its estimates, bitcoin may currently be undervalued. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","\"The bitcoin to gold [volume] ratio has declined modestly towards 4x, which in our framework would suggested an unchanged fair value of around $38k implying significant upside for digital assets from here,\" the report said.","Based on the price of bitcoin (BTC) at the time of writing, which was $29,774 according to Coinbase data via TradingView, it is currently 21% below this price.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe past month\u2019s crypto market correction looks more like capitulation relative to last January\/February and going forward we see upside for bitcoin and crypto markets more generally,\u201D said the report.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
