Teneo, an advisory firm, has been working to preserve the hedge fund\u2019s assets following a spectacular collapse.","3AC had been a victim of the market-wide crypto selloff last month. As its balance sheets were hit, it began insolvency proceedings <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/154809\/three-arrows-capital-liquidation-teneo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in the British Virgin Islands<\/a>, which was followed by a Chapter 15 bankruptcy filing in the US.&nbsp;","Zhu, today, tweeted screenshots of emails which appear to be from 3AC lawyers, Advocatus Law LLP. The first argues that creditors have failed to engage with the process of liquidation \u201Cin good faith.\u201D","\u201CIt has come to our clients' attention that you have made an application in the United States of America, alleging that they have not been cooperating with you in any meaningful way, and detailing some of the discussions, and the manner in which we had them, on 8 July 2022,\u201D wrote Christopher Anand Daniel, managing partner of Advocatus.","\u201CIt now appears clear why your Singapore solicitors were keen to ask if the discussions were on a 'without prejudice' basis. It was to use the discussions in Court filings without notice to our clients.\u201D","The second screenshot addresses the company\u2019s relationship with the Israeli crypto startup StarkWare \u2014 and whether 3AC\u2019s liquidators had exercised the right to buy a StarkWare token. 3AC had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/148672\/starkware-raises-series-d-funding-8-billion-valuation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">invested in<\/a> the business, which recently hit a valuation of $8 billion, and provides tech for Ethereum scalability and permissionless, decentralized ZK-rollups for deploying smart contracts.","\u201COur clients, as you know, besides being former directors of the company, are also investors, and shareholders of the company. One of our clients, Mr Zhu Su, is also a creditor,\u201D Daniel wrote.","\u201CIn these capacities, they are extremely concerned by the Liquidators' failure to exercise StarkWare's token purchase offer (\"StarkWare Exercise\"), a fact that was confirmed by you in the call on 8 July 2022.\u201D","The Block has contacted Advocatus and Starkware for comment.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update 7:15 a.m. ET: story updated throughout with additions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
