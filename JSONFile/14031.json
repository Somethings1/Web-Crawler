Just behind is Ark\/21Shares, after reducing its fee dramatically from 0.8% to 0.25%, including no fees for the first six months or until the ETF reaches $1 billion in assets. VanEck is also offering a fee of 0.25%, and BlackRock has set a competitive sponsor fee of 0.3% for its ETF \u2014 reducing it to 0.2% for the first 12 months or until the fund hits $5 billion in assets.
