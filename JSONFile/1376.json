The company has also entered into a miner swap agreement with another bitcoin \"mining counterparty.\" All the rigs that were previously in Coinmint's facility in Massena, NY are expected to be redeployed in June, per Riot's statement.","Riot deployed 4,676 S19j Pro rigs at Whinstone in June and is set to receive 6,333 additional ones in July. The miner expects to reach 5.0 EH\/s once they are all deployed. It also forecasts reaching 12.5 EH\/s by January of 2023.","In June, Riot produced 421 BTC and sold 300, generating $6.2 million. As of June 30, it held 6,654 BTC.","Throughout the month, the company curtailed energy consumption by 8,648 megawatt-hours. Riot coordinates efforts with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to power down at times when the grid is under stress and electricity prices go up.","\"We view this as an important part of our partnership-driven approach with ERCOT and our commitment to being a good corporate citizen in our communities,\" said CEO Jason Les. \"Participation in the 4CP program also reduces Riot\u2019s energy costs in the proceeding year.\"","Last month, high temperatures in Texas led to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/151084\/bitcoin-miners-in-texas-have-been-powering-down-amid-heatwave-and-record-electricity-demand\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">record-breaking power use levels for the month of June<\/a>.","Â© 2023 The Block.
