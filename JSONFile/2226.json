The same word also saw 329% growth on WeChat and was searched for 3,331,874 times. The positive momentum continued into the weekend, with the search volumes for \"blockchain\" increased by around 170% on both WeChat and Baidu on Saturday.&nbsp;","Meanwhile, search volumes for \"bitcoin\" did not gain as strong an upswing as \"blockchain,\" and even saw a slight 5% dip on Friday on both WeChat and Baidu.
