These two withdrawals totaled roughly 1.46 billion QANX tokens \u2014 worth about $1 million at the time of the attack. One of the addresses involved in the attack has also been linked to other phishing attacks. The hacker also stole another $1 million worth of QANX tokens from the BNB cross-chain bridge, data from <a href=\"https:\/\/bscscan.com\/tx\/0xf93047e41433d73ddf983cfa008aeb356ec89803c0a92b0e97ccdc6c42a13f51\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BSCscan<\/a> shows. This happened around the same time as the first withdrawal from the Ethereum side of the bridge.","Bridge security has become a major issue in the crypto industry following several major attacks. For example, earlier in October, a hacker <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175437\/biance-bnb-chain-is-back-up-after-bridge-exploit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stole $100 million<\/a> from the BNB Chain cross-chain bridge.","Today\u2019s hack may also be related to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172773\/hacker-steals-950000-from-crypto-vanity-address-as-exploits-continue\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">profanity address vulnerability<\/a> that has also plagued other projects. This particular vulnerability has to do with vanity addresses \u2014 special custom addresses created by users. Security researchers previously identified a weakness associated with these addresses, through which their private keys can be \u201Cbrute-forced.\u201D","According to blockchain security outfit <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BlockSecTeam\/status\/1579781207503802369\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlockSec<\/a>, the QANplatform\u2019s deployer address is vulnerable to the bug. As such, it is possible that the attacker may have been able to uncover the private keys and used them to withdraw funds from the bridge.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The QANplatform token has crashed 94% since a hacker stole $1 million from its crypto bridge.

As of the time of publishing, the attacker has sold approximately 30% of the stolen funds in exchange for 230 ETH, worth $295,000. This selloff and the news of the hack have seen the QANX token take a massive tumble, dropping 94% from $0.012 to $0.0007 in less than an hour.","The attacker may now face some difficulties in disposing of the remainder of the stolen funds. QANplatform has withdrawn liquidity for its token from both Uniswap and Pancakeswap. \u201CThe trading, deposits and withdrawals on CEXes has been paused,\u201D the team added.
