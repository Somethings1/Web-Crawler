The USYC token (not to be confused with other stablecoins) issued on the Noble blockchain will provide investors exposure to short-duration securities, including U.S. treasury bills. It could also be moved across the broader Cosmos ecosystem.","Noble is known for being the native asset issuance network for Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin in the Cosmos ecosystem. On the other hand, Hashnote, backed by investors like DRW Holdings and Cumberland, is an asset manager offering management strategies in crypto and real-world assets.","Noble aims to tap into the RWA niche on Cosmos with its USYC rollout. The market for RWAs is still nascent but rapidly growing. In particular, tokenized securities have seen a swift increase in value over the last year, with the market size estimated at over $500 million, according to Dune <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/steakhouse\/tokenized-securities\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a>.","Cosmos is an ecosystem of over 80 application-specific blockchains \u2014 such as Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Injective, Noble and several others \u2014 which have a combined market capitalization exceeding $45 billion. These blockchains can interact with each other using the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol.","As the first cross-chain RWA on Cosmos, USYC is expected to be used across a diverse range of applications, including as collateral in DeFi apps across the Cosmos ecosystem \u2014 according to a statement. \u201CThis initiative will demonstrate the power of the IBC protocol in making real-world assets natively interoperable,\u201D said Noble CEO and co-founder Jelena Djuric.","According to Noble, USYC will have a \"T+1 redemption\" guarantee. This refers to the promise that an investment can be redeemed (sold back to the issuing entity) one business day after the trade date.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Listen to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/274231\/cosmos-noble-skip\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jelena Djuric on The Scoop podcast<\/a> discuss how Noble plans to bring interoperable RWAs to Cosmos.<\/em>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
