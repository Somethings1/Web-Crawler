Previous investors, including Digital Currency Group, True Ventures and Boston Seed, also backed the round.","Last November, Flipside raised $4.5 million in a seed round from investors including Coinbase Ventures. Today\u2019s round brings the firm\u2019s total funding to date to $11.6 million. Flipside said it is now valued at $32.1 million.","With the fresh capital, the startup is looking to expand its team and further develop its solutions. \u201CWe\u2019ll be continuing to invest deeply in resources and solutions to enable depth of insights that are able to be acted upon,\u201D Dave Balter, CEO of Flipside Crypto, told The Block.","The firm currently has 14 people, with the majority in data science and data pipelining segments, and by Q1 2020, it will have about six more people, Balter said, adding: \u201CThis raise will add a few resources, but it\u2019s really about continued development of the solutions and data we are able to provide to our customers.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">'Chainwalking'<\/strong>","Flipside provides a solution called \"Chainwalking,\" which decodes a blockchain network, say Ethereum or Bitcoin, to enable \u201Ca deep understanding of stakeholder behaviors including speculators, miners, voters and actual customers.\u201D","\u201CThere is a strong demand for analytics that help these companies tie off-chain activities to on-chain results and price, which is exactly what Flipside provides,\u201D said Greg Wasserman, head of venture at Galaxy Digital Ventures, on leading the investment.","Balter told The Block that there are \u201Cmany\u201D blockchain projects \u201Cwhose token price and market cap are depressed,\u201D and he believes that these projects will require some form of understanding of their stakeholder behaviors, and thus creating a demand for Flipside\u2019s solutions. \u201CWe\u2019d love to chainwalk any blockchain that is seeking to understand its stakeholder behaviors,\u201D he said, adding:","\u201CChainwalking is free, while derived insights from chainwalking are the part of our business that is fee-based.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nFlipside has three packages for its solutions, priced from $2,000 to $8,000, and its 2019 revenue to date is at $500,000, according to a Medium blog post also published on Tuesday. When asked about revenue expectations going forward, Balter declined to comment.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Insights?<\/strong>","Some of the interesting insights that Flipside has come across by analyzing nearly 30 blockchain networks are that there are \u201Cmany many mainnet launches,\u201D however, \u201Cmost of these organizations haven't planned beyond launching their own chain, and are struggling to identify patterns to focus on customers,\u201D Balter told The Block.","Another trend that the firm has observed is that money flow as a real challenge and opportunity. \u201CSome firms believe miners and investors are hoarding their token creating liquidity problems and further deflating price expectations (we help them prove what is actually happening so they can solve it).\u201D","On a positive side though, a few \"above and beyond\" blockchains have begun to aggregate actual users for relatively traditional business models, Balter said.&nbsp;","The firm also provides a Fundamental Crypto Asset Score (FCAS) for over 500 cryptocurrencies, which is distributed via data sites such as CoinMarketCap, Messari and MarketWatch, among others.","Startups that are focusing on on-chain data are booming.
