It claims assets \u2014 including its web3 wallet MetaMask, partly developed by some of the plaintiffs \u2014 were transferred out of Consensys AG, leaving them with worthless shares.&nbsp;","Lubin allegedly arranged to move the assets to a new U.S.-based company, CSI, in 2020, so it could solicit outside investment, with the help of Consensys General Counsel Matt Corva, enabling Lubin to replace the plaintiffs with Wall Street investors.","Lubin also brought in investment bank JPMorgan, who, in exchange for its own blockchain business, Quorum, received 10% of CSI, according to the complaint. Corva, JPMorgan and Umar Farooq, Global Head of Blockchain at JPMorgan, are also listed as defendants.","When Lubin established Consensys in 2014, many employees accepted lower salaries with the understanding they would receive company equity, according to the suit. Lubin reportedly dedicated 30% of the company to employee stock, with the suing party holding about 9% of that portion.","Legal representatives for the former employees argue that while Lubin prospered, those who believed in his early vision and accepted stock over higher pay ended up with empty promises.&nbsp;\u201CHe broke his word,\u201D the lawyers wrote. \u201CIn the process, he violated his legal commitments and duties. While Lubin got rich, plaintiffs got nothing.\u201D","\u201CPlaintiffs in an ongoing shareholder case against the Swiss-based web3 incubator and investor Consensys AG, which operates as Consensys Mesh, have just filed suit against U.S. blockchain software developer Consensys Software Inc. in New York state court,\u201D a Consensys spokesperson told The Block via email.&nbsp;","\u201CAfter two years of getting nowhere with their frivolous claims against Consensys Mesh in a Swiss court, plaintiffs now believe their meritless claims stand a better chance of yielding a pay day if they game U.S. courts and entangle Consensys Software and other unrelated parties in litigation,\u201D the spokesperson added. \u201CWe fully expect that the plaintiffs, who were never employees of Consensys Software, will soon find this gambit is another fruitless attempt to enrich themselves from the success of others.\u201D","CSI has raised at least $726.7 million from investors, according to the suit, with its valuation rising to more than $7 billion following Series D financing.","Â© 2023 The Block.
