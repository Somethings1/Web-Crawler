Tandem attributes the larger losses to investment in infrastructure and to having made provision for defaults on unsecured loans.&nbsp;","Its income increased from £15.4m in 2018 to £24.8m the following year, driven primarily by growth in unsecured lending.","The accounts, which were filed January 11, 2021, were signed off by Tandem's directors and auditors PwC in August of 2020.&nbsp;","The report highlights the impact of the Covid-19 crisis and suggests it has made \u201Cgoing concern assessments more testing and judgemental\u201D.","\u201CTandem is not isolated from this environment and faces the same issues with implications across future revenue generating activities, credit losses and ability to fundraise, which results in material uncertainty in the group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern,\u201D the report continues. &nbsp;","A similar warning in the annual accounts of Monzo, a rival digital bank, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/07\/31\/monzo-losses-double-as-uk-digital-bank-warns-of-pandemic-uncertainty.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">caused a stir<\/a> in July.","A spokesperson for Tandem told The Block the material concern note is \u201Cprudent and appropriate given Tandem is still a loss-making business and no different to the statements you\u2019ll see in the accounts of many other startups\u201D.","\u201CHowever, you'll also notice the closure of a £60 million fundraising round in August 2020, and we've made a number of adjustments to our banking product portfolio. We\u2019ve also demonstrated significant resilience through the Covid-19 pandemic, and we remain on track to hit profitability this year,\u201D they continued.","Tandem closed a £60m raise in August 2020 while simultaneously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fnlondon.com\/articles\/the-complex-waggle-dance-behind-honeycombs-bank-investment-20200902\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announcing the acquisition<\/a> of green finance firm Allium Lending Group. The move was part of a restructuring process that will see Tandem position itself as a clean energy-focused bank.","PwC wrote that Tandem would require additional capital injections within the next twelve months from the date it signed off on the accounts if the digital bank is to continue at its planned rate of growth.","\u201CIn order to meet future regulatory requirements and to continue in business as a going concern, the company will either have to moderate its rate of growth or raise further capital,\u201D wrote PwC.","© 2023 The Block.
