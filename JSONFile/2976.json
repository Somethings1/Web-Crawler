When asked what are the chances the network goes down again, Yakovenko replied, \u201CI don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t really matter, though.\u201D","His argument went as follows: as long as there\u2019s at least one copy of the ledger, the funds are still safe and the transactions will eventually get processed. If you don\u2019t care how long a transaction takes to go through, \u201Cthen how much do you care that there's a 72 hour block?\u201D&nbsp;","Yakovenko likened the downtime to a particularly long wait between blocks. He claimed that Solana didn\u2019t really go offline, there just wasn\u2019t a confirmed block for that time period. \u201CSo that technically does look like a 17-hour block if you look at the history.\u201D","He pointed out that it is possible that bitcoin could have a two-hour period with no blocks. He said: \u201CIf the validators got really, really good and recovered within two hours, is it the same?\u201D","He also claimed that other blockchain platforms, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum offer soft guarantees at transactions going through \u2014 particularly for those who don\u2019t have the funds to pay the transaction fees.","But the downtime is a problem for people who need their transactions to be processed at high speeds, Yakovenko acknowledged. \u201CIt matters for people that care about delivery of messages within 400 milliseconds.\u201D","\u201CSo in terms of safety to funds in the state, it doesn't matter. In terms of real-world application, it does,\u201D he added.","Yakovenko said that he couldn\u2019t assert that Solana would never go down again because it\u2019s hard to make such a guarantee under all circumstances and prove it.","\u201CSo you kind of saw the worst case of it, right? Shit hit the fan. They figured out how to continue,\" he told The Block. \"But to say that it never happens, I don't even know if that's possible in any realistic way, in any network.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Editor's Note:&nbsp;<\/strong>Corrects a quotation from Anatoly Yakovenko, changing 40 milliseconds to 400 milliseconds.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["SOLANA"]}
