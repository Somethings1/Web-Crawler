Unsustainable consensus mechanisms should only be applied on a small scale.\"","The delay was welcomed by many in the crypto industry.&nbsp;","\"Postponing the vote is the right decision, as several critically important issues in the bill remain unresolved,\" Seth Hertlein, global head of policy for Paris-based wallet manufacturer Ledger, told The Block. \"The future financial competitiveness of Europe depends on getting MiCA right.\"","But as Patrick Hansen, head of strategy and growth at Berlin-based Unstoppable Finance <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/paddi_hansen\/status\/1497174087449382921\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pointed out<\/a>, it remains to be seen how long this process will take.","© 2023 The Block.
