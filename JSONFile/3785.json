The Ethereum mining business set the company up for success with bitcoin mining, as it now shifts focus to the latter, it said.","\"Hive has successfully used its Ethereum operations to fund and help build out our company\u2019s global Bitcoin mining operations. Our plans are to continue expanding our sustainable green energy Bitcoin mining and seek out new growth opportunities throughout this bear cycle,\" said executive chairman Frank Holmes. \"The company has sold substantively all of its Ethereum.\"","As of Sept. 30, the Hive had a balance of 3,350 BTC and 356 ETH&nbsp; \u2014 down from 5,100 ETH at the end of August.","The company's GPU hashrate shifted to other mineable coins, setting up payouts in Bitcoin, as opposed to holding those coins. It produced an additional 15.8 BTC this way following The Merge.","Hive's total BTC equivalent produced from GPU mining fell 44% month-over-month \u2014 from 228.4 BTC strictly from Ethereum mining in August to 111.7 BTC from Ethereum and 15.8 BTC from other coins in September.","\u201CAs a testament to Hive\u2019s industry-leading hashing uptime, and resilience to navigate new opportunities in proof-of-work mining, we have emerged with continued revenue earning payouts in Bitcoin from all of our GPU fleet thanks to our global technical team,\" said Hive President and COO&nbsp; Aydin Kilic.","Days before The Merge, Hive said that it was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/168044\/crypto-miner-hive-blockchain-testing-other-gpu-mineable-coins-ahead-of-the-merge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">testing other GPU minable coins<\/a> as it strategized how to optimize the 6.5 TH\/s of Ethereum mining capacity it had (16% of its total energy capacity).","\"If it is clear that BTC mining earns substantially more $\/KWHR (dollars per kilowatt-hour) we would pursue expanding the BTC fleet,\" the company then told The Block.","Hive's bitcoin mining operational capacity was 2.28 EH\/s by September 30. IT plans to reach 2.7 EH\/s by the end of this month and add an additional 1 EH\/s in the next three to four months.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
