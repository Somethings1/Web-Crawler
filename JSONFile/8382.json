It hasn't revealed which entities it uses to carry out exchange activities, where those entities are based and if they are regulated there.","While the exchange has entities in multiple offshore locations, it has now stated that its Cayman Islands entity isn't being used to carry out exchange activities \u2014 following a statement last week by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA), which said the exchange was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/110358\/cayman-islands-investigate-crypto-exchange-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">not licensed<\/a> to offer crypto services.","\"Binance.com has always operated in a decentralized manner. We do however, have entities incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands performing activities that are permitted by law and not related to operating crypto-exchange trading activities,\" a Binance spokesperson told The Block in a statement, adding, \"We will work with regulators to address any questions they may have.\"","Not only did the FCA put out a statement about Binance in particular but it also sent a letter calling on e-money firms operating in the country to make it clear to their customers how their money is protected. Plus, the regulator told them to clarify the difference between placing money with an e-money firm as opposed to in a traditional bank account.&nbsp;","\u201CWe are still concerned that many e-money firms are not adequately disclosing the differences in protections between their services and traditional banking, in particular, that FSCS protection does not apply,\u201D the FCA wrote, emphasizing the importance of giving clients \u201Ca fair and prominent indication of any risks.\u201D","The FSCS, or Financial Services Compensation Scheme, protects the deposits of an individual or a company for up to £85,000. If an authorized financial services firm fails, like a bank, for instance, the scheme may be able to pay compensation if the involved individual or company is not able to.&nbsp;","The FCA gave exchanges six weeks from the publication of the letter to remind their customers of how their money is protected and to make clear FSCS protection does not apply to them. Since then, various crypto firms including Coinbase, Wirex, and Uphold have issued statements to their clients.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
