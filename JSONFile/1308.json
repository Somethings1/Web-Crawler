The idea is that this will in turn make it easier for developers to discover useful ones, without the need for a centralized aggregator or publisher.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Users of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/the-graph-research-web3-defi-81734\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Graph<\/a> have already been curating subgraphs, which are built to retrieve specific kinds of data required for a DApp \u2014 for instance, the decentralized video streaming service LivePeer \u2014 to run smoothly.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But curation will begin \u201Cin earnest\u201D on Thursday with the launch of the curation market, Yaniv Tal, co-founder of Edge &amp; Node, which created The Graph protocol, said in a recent interview with The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The initiative is part of The Graph\u2019s ongoing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/72790\/ethereum-devs-the-graph\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">efforts to decentralize<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The platform has been transitioning from a centrally hosted service to one that is run by a decentralized network.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So far, 20,000 developers have built 16,000 subgraphs hosted on The Graph\u2019s centralized hosting service. Eight DApps \u2014 <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LivePeer, Audius, UMA, mStable, Reflexer, Opyn, PoolTogether, DODO \u2014 <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">have migrated to The Graph\u2019s decentralized protocol.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The new curation market is in line with what Tal promised last year after an outage knocked many applications offline. He said that eventually, developers would no longer have to publish their subgraphs directly to The Graph\u2019s hosted service, and that \u201Cindependent indexers\u201D would \u201Crun nodes and process queries in an open marketplace.\u201D He added that \u201Ccurators\u201D would \u201Corganize data and signal which subgraphs are useful and accurate.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">How does it work in practice? Once a curator finds a good subgraph, they signal on it using Subgraph Studios \u2014 The Graph\u2019s new hub for subgraph creation, which also launched Thursday.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An individual signals that a subgraph contains useful information,&nbsp;said Baptiste Greve, product manager at Edge &amp; Node. If others agree on the utility of the subgraph, they too will signal on it. The more signals the subgraph has, the more likely it is to generate query fees that can then be turned into a reward.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CYou're incentivized to select good subgraphs that are actually being used,\u201D said Greve.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While The Graph\u2019s release mentions that anyone with a smartphone can now become a curator, Greve notes that an individual will need a Metamask wallet \u2014 usually obtained as a computer web browser extension \u2014 to receive payment.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While curators on The Graph protocol may earn revenue, Tal stresses that revenue is based on a bonding curve \u2014 the relationship between a token supply and price, in which the less token supply, the lower the price and vice versa.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCurators can make or lose money through curation based on the economics of the bonding curve,\u201D Tal said. \u201CSo it's important that curators understand the sub graphs that they're signaling on, as well as the dynamics on those bonding curves.\u201D<\/span>"],"hashtag":[]}
