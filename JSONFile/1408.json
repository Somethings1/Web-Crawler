When asked why the cut, Dudler said: \"We raise just as much as we require to fuel the accelerating growth in 2021.\"","As for its growth plans, SEBA is looking to expand domestically and internationally, as well as increase its lending capacity and bring new products and services to the market.","SEBA said it will also tokenize its shares of the Series B \"soon after\" Switzerland's blockchain law comes into force on February 1, 2021.","The bank has seen a couple of key exists in recent months.
