Binance, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, currently has no head office, but it did recently receive licenses to provide crypto services in Bahrain and Dubai.","Binance declined to comment on \u201Crumors and speculation.\u201D","Crypto is front and center at the European Parliament this week as it debates proposed anti-money laundering legislation. On Thursday, lawmakers in the parliament\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be voting on multiple AML packages \u2013 that will apply to crypto transactions as well as crypto asset service providers \u2013 before the drafts head to further negotiations between branches of the European Union (EU) government.","One framework up for a decisive vote on Thursday, aimed at extending existing AML laws to crypto transactions, contains provisions looking to end anonymous crypto payments and include transfers to self-hosted or private wallets (also called unhosted wallets) in AML checks. The provisions have drawn the ire of the crypto industry around the world because individuals and businesses view the rules as a threat to privacy.","The other, slightly overlooked framework that would prevent the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing is also up for a vote on Thursday. In addition to the provision seeking to cut off non-compliant crypto firms from the EU, this draft framework contains a proposal from lawmakers to set up a public register of shell banks and unregulated crypto firms.","According to the provision, the responsibility of setting up and maintaining the registry would fall under the new AML authority (AMLA), which lawmakers are working to ensure will have supervision power over the crypto space.","\u201CAMLA shall set up and maintain an indicative and non-exhaustive public register of shell banks and non-compliant crypto-asset service providers operating within and outside the Union based on information provided by competent authorities, supervisors, the Commission or obliged entities,\u201D the draft said. These measures are needed given the high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing inherent to these entities, according to the draft.","Read more: Crypto Privacy Positions Harden Ahead of Crunch EU Vote","The provisions pertaining to non-compliant crypto firms and shell banks were proposed by the co-rapporteurs, Finnish politician Eero Heinäluoma and French politician Damien Carême, in charge of overseeing the framework as it moves through the legislative process.","\u201CYour co-rapporteurs extend specific enhanced due diligence measures to crypto-asset transactions, service providers and accounts, and insert a specific prohibition of correspondent relationships with non-compliant crypto-asset service providers,\u201D the draft said.","The proposed AML measures, including the controversial provision seeking to impose verification requirements for crypto transfers to unhosted wallets, are likely to pass through the committee vote on Thursday."],"entity":[{"type":"Cayman Islands","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Crypto Privacy Positions Harden Ahead of Crunch EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bahrain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"the Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Union (EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"\u2019s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Malta","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"European Parliament","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Italy","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Eero Heinäluoma","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AMLA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Damien Carême","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["EU","EU Parliament","AML","Unhosted Wallets","Regulation"],"authors":["Sandali Handagama"]}
