Only 35% of women engaged in at least one crypto-related activity in the past year versus nearly 50% of men, according to a recent <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mastercard.com\/news\/perspectives\/2022\/digital-payment-landscape-2022\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">global consumer survey<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> by Mastercard.

To ensure inclusion and to foster true innovation, women and underrepresented minorities must have a seat at the table.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The majority of women have heard of cryptocurrency and digital assets, but many are still unsure about understanding its ins and outs, according to Mastercard\u2019s New Payment Index. Only 58% of women are aware of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) versus 75% of men. In the past year, only 9% of women made a payment using cryptocurrency versus 18% of men. Women are also less likely to say they are considering using crypto for a purchase in the coming year.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But at the same time, we know that women\u2019s appetite for more crypto knowledge is strong. The 75% of women who are familiar with crypto agree that they would use the digital currency more if they understood it better. Mastercard plans to provide women with the tools to safely take the first step and explore Web3 and crypto.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Women are starting to step in<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Over the last several years, we have seen some great groups emerge that are connecting and supporting women who are working in Web3 and crypto while also encouraging more to join the space. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shefi.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SheFi<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, for example, helps women go from \u201Ccrypto curious\u201D to \u201Ccrypto confident.\u201D Other groups that are doing excellent work in helping to bridge the gap include <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.herhouse.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HerHouse<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, a Web3 ecosystem of women and non-binary builders; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/Blu3_dao\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blu3 DAO<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, which promotes learning through hackathons and technical workshops; and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/boysclub.vip\/learn\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Boys Club<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, which founders call a \u201Cno bro zone for the crypto curious.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bridging the gender gap<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At Mastercard, we want to do our part to help bridge this significant gender gap and engage more women and non-binary individuals to work in Web3 and crypto.
