If KYC procedures are not completed, users will only be able to use services such as spot trading sell orders, futures trading deleveraging, margin trading deleveraging, \"earn\" product redemptions and ETF redemptions, KuCoin said. They will not be able to make deposits to the exchange but they can withdraw.","The move comes four months after New York State Attorney General Letitia James <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/218600\/new-york-sues-kucoin-claims-ether-is-an-unregistered-security\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sued KuCoin<\/a>, saying the crypto exchange is an unregistered commodities and securities broker or dealer.

Given the new KYC policy, Lyu said there could be \"a short-term decline in trading volume, but in the long run, mandatory KYC is highly beneficial for combating malicious activities within the industry, protecting the funds of users\/partners, and establishing a healthy and sustainable ecosystem.\"","\"We also believe that our users will adapt to changes and support our initiatives,\" Lyu added.","Last year, KuCoin was valued at $10 billion when it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/146001\/crypto-exchange-kucoin-reaches-decacorn-status-in-latest-funding-round\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $150 million<\/a> in a pre-Series B funding round.
