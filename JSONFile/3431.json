Its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ritcap.com\/sites\/default\/files\/262142%20RIT%20AR%20web_0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2021 annual report<\/a> shows positions of £27.8 million, £33.2 million and £20.8 million in Animoca Brands, Kraken and Paxos, respectively.

In 2022, the sharp correction in public markets, and in particular tech markets, has meant that we have written down a portion of these significant gains.\u201D","He also wrote that RIT\u2019s private investments are, \u201Cby design, multi-year investments, which we are not forced to sell to fund redemptions.\u201D","RIT, Kraken and Paxos did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Animoca Brands declined to comment.","The news comes amid a broad reset in how investors value crypto startups, and indeed tech startups in general, after a period of exuberant venture capital investing in 2021 and 2022.","Yesterday, London-based Molten Ventures Plc <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-06-15\/london-s-molten-ventures-writes-down-crypto-startup-ledger-revolut-stakes#xj4y7vzkg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">de-valued its stakes<\/a> in Revolut, the fintech and crypto business, and crypto security firm Ledger by 40% and 22%, respectively.
