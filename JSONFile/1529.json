Wednesday's breach resulted in Twitter users sending more than $100,000 to the same bitcoin address shared by compromised accounts, all of which promised outside rewards for those who sent funds.","At the time of publication, tests conducted by The Block Research show litecoin, XRP, monero, bitcoin and ethereuem addresses are unable to be shared.","","","&nbsp;","Trying to share such an address populates the following message:","\u201CThis request looks like it might be automated.
