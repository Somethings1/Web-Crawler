Key to the project's promise is that BitVM would require no changes to the underlying Bitcoin code \u2013 seen as crucial due to the blockchain's decentralized governance, often lacking consensus among developers over major upgrades.","Lerner had disclosed last month during an exclusive interview last week on CoinDesk's The Protocol podcast that he was working with colleagues on the new project without providing details.","Last week, Rootstock Labs published a blog post on the effort, arguing that \"theory and practice are two very different things,\" referring to Linus's original concept.","\"The BitVMX research team intends to build on this initial discovery with additional innovations to create an improved development framework for running programs on Bitcoin,\" according to the blog post. \"The name is a nod to BitVMX\u2019s origins while highlighting its focus on extending Bitcoin and accelerating the development of the next generation of sidechains and layer 2s.\"","Rootstock Labs added that \"a team of core contributors is working on a public roadmap of proposed improvements to the network in the next 12 months.\"","According to an accompanying whitepaper, \"BitVMX framework provides the foundations to run any CPU on Bitcoin, with a focus to run a fully-compliant RISC-V processor programmable using a standard compilation toolchain\" \u2013 a technical description of the new system that boils down to facilitating a \"myriad of use cases.\"","Read more: How the Bitcoin Halving Will Drive Action to Layer 2s","Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."],"entity":[{"type":"Rootstock Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Halving Will Drive Action","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Austin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sergio Demian Lerner","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Robin Linus","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Texas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Aoyon Ashraf","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"TEXAS","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Buenos Aires","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lerner","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Layer 2s","Rootstock","Bitvm"],"authors":["Bradley Keoun"]}
