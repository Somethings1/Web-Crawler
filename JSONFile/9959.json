As China pursues an aggressive reopening campaign, it will attract FDI flows away from LatAm in 2023. As demand for LatAm currencies is subsequently reduced, inflation could skyrocket even higher. When this dynamic is combined with the fact that many Latin Americans don\u2019t trust their local banking systems, it is clear that their access to financial services is more broken than ever before.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Latin Americans will need two things more in 2023 than they ever needed before: 1) a more stable currency option, 2) a secure platform where they can do more with their digital assets.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For a more stable currency option, look no further than stablecoins.&nbsp;<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Latin America consistently leads the adoption charts for not only crypto, but also stablecoins, viewing it as a more stable currency offering than their local currencies.
