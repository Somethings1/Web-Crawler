Then Binance Stepped In","category":["Finance"],"content":["What happens when there\u2019s a multimillion-dollar margin call and no one picks up the phone?","That eerie prospect threatened to become a nightmarish reality last week for Solend, Solana\u2019s second-biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) outpost. Its single-largest user \u2013 a wallet with $107 million in USDC borrowed against $170 million in SOL collateral \u2013 was on the verge of liquidation and completely MIA.","Developers tried Reddit posts, on-chain messages, even Twitter memes, hoping to alert the anonymous account of its impending fate. The whale account needed to either pony up more collateral or reduce its position to ward off a catastrophic on-chain liquidation that, project leads said, could crash Solend \u2013 and maybe even Solana.","The frantic rush to save Solend exploded into a governance and power controversy that elicited accusations of DeFi hypocrisy on Crypto Twitter and beyond.","Ultimately, it was CeFi giant Binance who woke the whale, Solend\u2019s pseudonymous co-founder Rooter told CoinDesk. The world\u2019s largest crypto exchange delivered a message to the account on Rooter\u2019s behalf.","\u201CI\u2019m sorry that this issue has caused concern in the Solana community and with the Solana team,\u201D the user emailed Rooter on June 21, according to screenshots shared with CoinDesk. \u201CThere\u2019s no hard feelings about the recent governance proposal.\u201D","Read more: DeFi Protocol Solend Passes Governance Vote to Reverse \u2018Emergency Powers\u2019","After establishing contact, the whale began redistributing its Solend bets into other Solana DeFi outposts like Mango Markets \u2013 ending the most acute crisis without a single cascading liquidation. The price of SOL has recovered enough to quiet all the chaos \u2013 despite the heavy dose of momentary schadenfreude.","Solend\u2019s liquidation debacle came as the turbulent crypto markets rattled DeFi protocols of all stripes, pushing purportedly decentralized governing bodies to make tough decisions that affect protocol users in lasting ways.","That can make for a messy cocktail. In \u201Cdecentralized finance,\u201D programmatic smart contract code \u2013 devoid of the human biases that might, say, prompt a banker to refuse a loan to a minority group \u2013 is meant to be the immutable law of the land.","Of course, reality is more complicated.","Solend\u2019s crisis emerged because its protocol had set no limits on how big a borrower could be. That result: A single whale accounted for the vast majority of Solend\u2019s SOL collateral and USDC loans. That collateral was at risk of liquidation if the price of SOL fell too low.","Solend\u2019s smart contracts automatically send liquidation sell orders to DEXs when user collateral falls too low. They\u2019re pure, programmatic. They don\u2019t holistically check to see if a trade will crash the markets, or worse, the chain.","While billions of dollars in SOL trade hands every day, most of that action happens on centralized exchanges, not over the much more thinly traded DEXs, where DeFi cousin Solend routes its trades. DEXs don\u2019t have enough liquidity to soak up the whale\u2019s dump, meaning SOL\u2019s price would crash \u2013 perhaps 60% or 80% \u2013 until buyers arbitraged it back up.","That itself was a problem, Rooter said: \u201CIt\u2019s such a crazy art arbitrage opportunity and liquidation opportunity that bots would just flock.\u201D That type of activity has crashed the entire Solana blockchain in the past.","Solend was sure to take the brunt of the pain. It would be left with bad debt, a depleted treasury, and a disenchanted user base. \u201CIt\u2019s basically over for us and our users will lose a ton of money,\u201D Rooter said, explaining what would happen if the smart contracts did what they were designed to do.","\u201CWe really have to do something now,\u201D he said, recalling the outreach effort.","Bankers in traditional finance can address a comparable snafu with a \u201Cmargin call\u201D to clients whereby they lay out the stakes and explain the need for more collateral to secure a loan. After all, they know their counterparties\u2019 identities; the borrower is a phone call or email away. That\u2019s not the case with pseudonymous DeFi (though a handful of startups are working on inter-wallet messaging solutions, none of which Solend used).","Unable to broadcast their message privately, Rooter took the plea for the whale\u2019s attention public on Twitter. This spooked users into pulling their money from Solend en masse, emptying the vaults much as would happen in a bank run. Rooter admits the tweets backfired.","\u201CIt kind of exacerbated our problems because then not only were we dealing with a risk that something might happen, but we\u2019re dealing with an immediate problem that people\u2019s funds were frozen.\u201D","Their solution was a controversial proposal to grant Solend Labs \u201Cemergency powers\u201D over the whale\u2019s collateral. Once in control, the caretaker company would \u201Cgracefully\u201D liquidate the whale via off-chain, over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks and in effect sidestep the market zero day. It would turn the USDC back over to the whale, resolve the crisis and right the markets.","That said, it would overrule the smart contracts designed to be in control.","And that\u2019s where the optics became painful.","Many DeFi protocols put code changes up to the community. Their token holders get to vote on new listings, rate hikes, partnerships, that sort of thing. The bigger the user\u2019s token trove, the weightier its opinion. It\u2019s an imperfect system for managing purportedly decentralized systems, albeit a popular one.","Solend hadn\u2019t ever held a DAO vote before. But Rooter said it needed to put the controversial solution before the community. On June 19, it proposed SLND1, the \u201Cemergency powers\u201D package. Six hours later, the vote passed by 97.5% with just enough participation to meet the 1% quorum.","Read more: Solana DeFi Platform Votes to Control Whale Account in Bid to Avoid Liquidation 'Chaos'","Beneath SLND1\u2019s apparent landslide was a less savory picture: a single wallet with 1.01% of the turnout tokens (a ballot whale, if you will) made the difference. Without its participation, SLND1 would have failed to reach quorum and flopped on the technical. It only passed in the affirmative because it voted in the affirmative.","Rooter said Solend\u2019s team asked the ballot whale to vote after fretting over SLND1 low turnout. He said they did not ask the whale, who is active on Discord to vote yes or no, only that they participate. The ballot whale obliged.","\u201CUsers of the protocol have generally been very supportive. And then the critics tend to be like people on Twitter who have no stake or no deposits,\u201D Rooter said.","SLND1\u2019s critics were so loud and the media coverage so fierce that Rooter and the team proposed a new vote, SLND2, that would invalidate the first. It, too, passed after the ballot whale stepped in.","\u201CThe whale, again, basically swayed the whole vote,\u201D Rooter said.","After a lot of hemming and hawing \u2013 the whale didn\u2019t want to act just to appease \u201CCrypto Twitter\u2019s armchair experts,\u201D Rooter said \u2013 as well as tech hiccups, the ballot whale voted yes with 14 seconds to spare.","A final, June 21 vote on SLND3 saw the community approve what is effectively a new borrower ceiling at $50 million. This too was designed to mitigate whale risk. (It also passed with the ballot whale\u2019s critical \u201Cyes\u201D vote).","By this point Rooter\u2019s parallel outreach effort had finally yielded fruit: Binance had gotten the borrower whale\u2019s attention, and they were in contact via email. Over the next couple of days, the situation slowly resolved.","Binance declined to comment on the Solend situation.","A spokesperson at the exchange confirmed it has been an intermediary between project teams and account holders in the past. The spokesperson said Binance never shares information without its users permission.","There\u2019s plenty of repetitional damage. Observers from Solana\u2019s VC community told CoinDesk they feared Solend had suffered an insurmountable setback with its series of governance votes.","It is \u201Cinertia versus terrible governance decisions,\u201D said one researcher on Monday. He wasn\u2019t sure which force would win.","Solend\u2019s total value locked (TVL) has dropped 10% over the last week and nearly 60% in a month while second-tier Solana DeFi lenders such as Larix, Hubble and Oxygen have fared far better. Mango Markets has gotten the lion\u2019s share of the whale redistribution.","Speaking to CoinDesk last Friday, Rooter struck a hopeful tone. By then, Solend had steered through the crisis without suffering a catastrophic liquidation.","\u201CI think this sentiment is kind of improving. I mean, the PR blowback has also blown over at this point. Solend lost a bunch of TVL. But, you know, people can use it now,\u201D Rooter said.","Solend remains the second-biggest DeFi project on Solana."],"entity":[{"type":"Larix","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Reddit","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"80%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"SOL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Solana DeFi Platform Votes to Control Whale Account","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$107 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"June 21","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DeFi Protocol Solend Passes Governance Vote to Reverse \u2018Emergency Powers\u2019","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"TVL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rooter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$170 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1.01%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"June 19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Crypto Twitter","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u201D Rooter","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"97.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Solend","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$50 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Solana","DeFi","Crypto Lending"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
