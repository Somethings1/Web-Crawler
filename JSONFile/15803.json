To achieve this, the majority of the WLD token supply will be given to new and existing users in the form of user grants over the years to come.\u201D","Worldcoin is an identity protocol backed by OpenAI founder Sam Altman. The protocol uses a hardware unit known as an Orb to identify individuals and prove they are human by scanning their irises \u2013 which the company says will ultimately benefit the broader crypto and artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystems as they are integrated into society.","Users verified by the Orb can claim WLD tokens on the project\u2019s app, where regulations allow, while Orb operators were paid for in USDC tokens per iris scan. It is unclear how much these operators make per scan.","WLD token prices fell nearly 6% to $1.48 in the past 24 hours.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$1.48","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 24","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["worldcoin","Wld","token","Markets"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
