It supports transfers and can be utilized in other DeFi protocols. The exchange rate between stUSDT and USDT is maintained at 1:1 by the stUSDT-RWA Contract (special rules may apply).<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nStaking rewards are distributed in the form of stUSDT through a daily rebase. There is also a wrapped version of stUSDT, known as wstUSDT. While a holder\u2019s stUSDT balance increases as it receives daily rebase rewards, wstUSDT accrues the underlying stUSDT rewards and will constantly increase in value beyond 1 stUSDT.","<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Growth<\/strong><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSince its launch, stUSDT has made an immediate impact on the market, with its TVL surpassing $22 million within the first 24 hours.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe TVL has continued to rise ever since.

This integration empowers users to effectively manage and invest their assets by leveraging the diverse Ethereum ecosystem.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nOn August 14, the stUSDT platform introduced support for TUSD staking.
