The firm partners with independent ATM operators, like Cardtronics, who own and manage ATMs in the U.S. at locations like convenience stores, pharmacies, and supermarkets. NCR acquired Cardtronics earlier this year for $2.5 billion.","With the LibertyX deal, NCR said it will offer the digital currency solution for banks, retailers, and restaurants.
