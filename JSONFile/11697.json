But by targeting service providers in the directive, authorities will have easier access to the necessary information from crypto users as the Commission looks to minimize the \u201Cadministrative burden\u201D for the industry.&nbsp;","As the proposal is a directive in contrast to a regulation \u2014 as is the case for matters of taxation in the EU \u2014 member states will have the freedom to decide how to implement the provisions. It also aligns with internationally recognized standards for reporting on crypto taxation as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175953\/oecd-releases-final-plan-to-crack-down-on-international-tax-evasion-using-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">defined<\/a> in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development report published in October.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An older version of the document obtained by The Block shows that the directive would have applied to both centralized and decentralized platforms. However the latest version removes this distinction, stating that the rules apply to regulated crypto-assets service providers.<\/span>","This draft proposal sweeps crypto assets into the EU's series of Directives on Administrative Co-operation, which outlines how member states need to report certain information for taxation purposes. Since direct taxation policy is not harmonized across the bloc, the tax reporting directives make sure that citizens don't evade taxation in other countries.","The document indicates that the some rules would start applying as early as 2025, with most coming into force in 2026.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Benjamin Robertson contributed reporting for this story.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
