{"summary":"The Cosmos-based, EVM-compatible Layer 1 has launched its public testnet \u2014 paving the way for a targeted mainnet release in Q2.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/271883\/berachain-public-testnet-mainnet-q2","publishDate":"2024-01-11T09:05:09","id":10853,"type":null,"title":"Berachain unveils Artio public testnet ahead of anticipated mainnet in Q2","category":["LAYER 1S"],"content":["Berachain, an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible Layer 1 blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK, has rolled out its public test network named Artio.","Berachain\u2019s previous private testnet, hosted under a non-disclosure agreement with various partners, saw around 50 teams deploy contracts in a month, according to a statement. \u201CThere are currently 30+ native teams building on Berachain with 100+ teams from other networks planning on deploying on testnet and mainnet, including name brands like Pendle, Redacted, Sudoswap, Abracadabra, and many more,\u201D Berachain said.","Upon the final launch expected later this year, Berachain will also be supported by custodians, cross-chain messaging and bridging protocols, and data availability solutions, it added. Berachain\u2019s mainnet planned for the second quarter of this year.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/research\/searching-for-alpha-berachain-215595\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Berachain<\/a> utilizes a variant of delegated proof of stake consensus called \u201Cproof of liquidity\u201D \u2014 an attack resistance mechanism meant to harmonize staking and align incentives between security and liquidity, according to the team behind the project.","Contrary to typical proof of stake chains, where (outside of external liquid staking service providers) users have to choose between contributing to security by staking with a validator or providing on-chain liquidity on a DeFi platform, proof of liquidity means users can only contribute toward network security by first doing the \u201Cwork\u201D of providing liquidity to a set of DeFi primitives, the team said.","In Berachain\u2019s tri-token system, users earn BGT staking tokens by providing liquidity to on-chain protocols such as a native DEX or stablecoin lending platform. \u201CBGT is naturally illiquid and soulbound, and cannot be market bought, only earned,\u201D with rewards controlled via validators and the network\u2019s governance process, the team added. However, BGT can be burned for the network\u2019s native gas token, bera, in a one-way process.","Validators then direct the staking rewards back into the Berachain ecosystem across multiple supported protocols to keep the network liquid. Users delegating BGT tokens to validators earn fees in honey tokens \u2014 Berachain\u2019s native stablecoin \u2014 from protocols on the network, as well as \u201Cbribes\u201D from the validators they are delegated to.","\u201CThrough their contribution to liquidity on the chain, users bootstrap its security,\u201D the team said, while also earning rewards. Protocols passing governance votes can integrate their smart contracts into Berachain's liquidity pool, attracting liquidity at reduced costs and driving capital efficiency. And \u201Cfor Cosmos validators, there\u2019s an opportunity to attract new capital and delegates from the EVM world, which has typically been a major restriction for growth in the Cosmos ecosystem,\u201D it added.","Berachain\u2019s bear-themed crypto project is run by a group of pseudonymous co-founders known as Homme Bera, Dev Bear, Papa Bear and Smokey the Bera. Its now 30-strong team has prior experience at projects such as Sui, Polygon, Mantle, Coinbase, Chainlink and Aave.","Under development since late 2021, Berachain is the co-founders' main foray into the industry after the NFT project \u201CBong Bears\u201D and other associated collections.","Speaking to The Block in April last year, Smokey the Bera originally anticipated the public testnet \u2014 and potentially the mainnet \u2014 to launch in 2023, amid <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227344\/berachain-funding-new-layer-1-blockchain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raising $42 million<\/a> in a private token round led by Polychain Capital. Participants also included Hack VC, Shima Capital, Robot Ventures and Goldentree Asset Management, among others.","Berachain began raising for the round shortly after the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185083\/ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX crypto exchange collapsed<\/a> in November 2022, with the deal closing \"not too long after,\" Smokey the Bera told The Block at the time.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
