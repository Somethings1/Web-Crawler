It competes with traditional platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd, but is focused on the needs of the DeFi sector, which is vulnerable to hacks and attacks.","According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/decentralized-finance\/exploits\/funds-stolen-by-defi-attackers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's Data Dashboard<\/a>, DeFi attackers have stolen over $400 million in funds to date. Amador said Immunefi has helped discover over 3,500 vulnerabilities to date, preventing over $2 billion worth of hacks.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/exploits\/funds-stolen-by-defi-attackers\/embed\" title=\"Funds stolen by DeFi attackers\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Immunefi's clients include Synthetix, Chainlink, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Compound, and more. The platform currently has over $47 million worth of bounties available, and to date, it has paid out over $7.5 million worth of bounties.","Earlier this month, Polygon, for example, paid out a record $2 million bounty via Immunefi to a whitehat hacker who discovered a critical vulnerability in the protocol that put approximately $850 million of capital at risk.","Speaking of its business model, Immunefi takes a 10% commission on top of any bounties paid out via the platform, said Amador.","To help scale its operations, Amador is also looking to expand its current team of 34 to over 100 people by the end of next year. The seed funding round comes after a \"small\" pre-seed round from \"family and friends,\" said Amador, adding that the firm expects to raise more funds as soon as it is ready to decentralize its operations.","Amador declined to comment when asked if Immunefi will launch its own token to meet its decentralization objectives."],"hashtag":[]}
