It said that the uncertainty has increased the risk of asymmetrical information between developers of a project and its users.","\"The U.S. approach is not one that the UK should consider adopting,\" a16z crypto said. \"We believe the UK can successfully adopt a principles-based approach to decentralization that facilitates the broad dissemination of cryptoassets to drive web3 innovation in the UK while prioritizing consumer protection in cryptoasset transactions.\"","","","When it comes to decentralized finance, a16z crypto urged the regulation of DeFi applications and businesses, not protocols or software.","\"DeFi can pose unique risks that existing regulatory frameworks are ill-suited to cover,\" it said. \"For that reason, a bespoke regulatory framework is optimal ... businesses can comprehend and comply with jurisdictional regulations.
