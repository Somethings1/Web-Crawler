But the company, which boasts 250,000 British customers, told The Block today it has now withdrawn its application altogether.","Despite this, Wirex will continue to offer crypto services to British customers \u2014 only now it will do so from an overseas base in Croatia named Wirex Digital, which is registered with HANFA, the local regulator.","\u201CThese changes will not affect customers, and Wirex continues to provide their industry-leading services as normal for customers globally, including those in the UK,\u201D said Wirex\u2019s CEO, Pavel Matveev. He added that Wirex\u2019s FCA-regulated e-money activities, offered through Wirex Limited, will continue unchanged.","Other crypto companies \u2014 including exchange giants like Coinbase \u2014 already offer services to British customers despite not being part of the FCA\u2019s crypto register. It is somewhat bizarre state of play that has led to top-tier law firms <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/124253\/lawyers-are-telling-crypto-clients-to-target-uk-customers-from-offshore-bases\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">advising crypto companies<\/a> to avoid setting up operations in the UK, even if they hope to serve UK customers.","Wirex is not the first big player to withdraw from the temporary register ahead of the formal deadline. On March 11, The Block revealed that crypto market maker B2C2 had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/137484\/crypto-firms-uk-close-fca-register\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">withdrawn from the list<\/a>, with plans to shift its spot trading operations to a US entity.","Several big players in the crypto market \u2014 including neobank Revolut and Copper, the custodian \u2014 are still listed on the temporary register, awaiting a final decision.","While their fate is as yet unclear, a person familiar with the matter said that Revolut expects to continue selling crypto services beyond the March 31 deadline. Copper, meanwhile, recently set up an entity in crypto-friendly Switzerland that could offer a fallback option if its application fails.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
