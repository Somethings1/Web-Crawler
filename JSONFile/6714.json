The second reason was that the main proposal to relaunch the blockchain had been amended during the vote.","As a result, Chorus One abstained from voting, has wound down its existing infrastructure and said that it will not be supporting the new Terra blockchain, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChorusOne\/status\/1528782897028771842\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">post<\/a> on Twitter.","Similarly, Figment said that it also will not be supporting the new blockchain. \u201CWe do not plan to support Terra 2.0 at launch and will make a decision to support Terra 2.0 at a later date, should we evaluate it as a new opportunity,\u201D it <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Figment_io\/status\/1529566363605356544\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> on Twitter.","Figment voted \"no with veto\" on the main proposal to relaunch the Terra blockchain. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.figment.io\/resources\/shutting-down-our-terra-validator-operations?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=protocol-content\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blog post<\/a>, it said, \u201CThe proposal has been unilaterally modified multiple times while the voting period was active, leading to a lack of confidence in the integrity of the vote itself.\u201D","Figment said it did not see launching a new chain this quickly as a solution. It added that Terraform Labs may still end up having influence over the new blockchain and that the company may face a range of lawsuits in the near future.&nbsp;","\u201CThese lawsuits could also pose unforeseen risk to infrastructure providers (such as Figment) in the future,\u201D it said.","Terra\u2019s new blockchain is being launched as a result of the collapse of the current chain. Its stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) lost its peg to the US dollar, leading to a death spiral for the blockchain\u2019s native token Luna (LUNA).","Following its collapse, Terra\u2019s governance saw a speedy turnaround as Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon proposed a new blockchain and put it to a vote. As The Block reported, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/147976\/do-kwon-amends-terra-2-0-proposal-during-the-vote-on-it\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal was modified<\/a> during the course of the vote, leading to the concerns about its integrity.","Despite this \u2014&nbsp;and a variety of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/147289\/terra-community-seems-dead-set-against-do-kwons-fork-proposal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">community<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/147803\/terra-validator-hits-out-at-do-kwons-dictatorship-model-on-key-fork-vote\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">validator<\/a> concerns \u2014&nbsp;the proposal passed and the new blockchain is set to go live on May 28, having been pushed back a day.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
