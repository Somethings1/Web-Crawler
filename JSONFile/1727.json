This change is crucial for integrating Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM) as well as enabling complex X-Chain transactions.","The Avalanche X-Chain, or Exchange Chain, is one of the three primary chains within the platform, alongside the P-Chain (Platform Chain) and C-Chain (Contract Chain). The X-Chain is specifically designed for creating and managing native Avalanche assets.","Additionally, the upgrade involved changes to the C-Chain, the smart contract layer compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Cortina increased the C-Chain block gas limit from 8 million to 15 million gas to accommodate the deployment of more complex dApps on the network. The gas target, a specific amount of gas that the network aims to consume within a given time window, will be kept at 15 million gas per 10 seconds.","The upgrade comes at a time when the C-Chain, where the bulk of activity takes place, is seeing a resurgence. Daily transactions have more than tripled year to date after a period of significant decline at the end of 2022, data from the Avalanche block explorer SnowTrace shows.","","","Â© 2023 The Block.
