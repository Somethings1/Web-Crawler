{"summary":"The CFTC is busily working on FTX\u2019s proposal to offer disintermediated crypto derivatives trading in the US. \nWhile the proposal has been wracked by political controversy, the CFTC is clearly invested in it.

Some have said it puts too many eggs in one basket when it comes to risk along the chain of settlement, rendering it vulnerable to market volatility. Some fear that it will go too soon into markets for physical commodities, which often settle physically, requiring shipment logistics rather than a motion from one digital wallet to another. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Other critics simply don\u2019t want US retail investors touching leverage \u2014 or, ultimately, investing in crypto at all.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wednesday's roundtable saw all of those arguments play out in the open. But, as FTX CEO Samuel Bankman-Fried told The Block following the hearing: \u201CIn the end, what\u2019s going to matter is the process of the commission and our application.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Barring concerted force majeure from Congress, the CFTC will make its own decision at its own pace. And given how FTX has successfully courted Democratic leadership in Congress, force majeure is unlikely.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As is traditional at roundtables, the CFTC commissioners themselves said almost nothing aside from general remarks. But they have clearly continued to work on the proposal despite the heat from critics.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Indeed, the proposal appears to be a top priority. Yesterday\u2019s roundtable was the first the commission held in person since before the Covid-19 pandemic era.
