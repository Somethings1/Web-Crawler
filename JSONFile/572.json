That would not only allow to maintain the guaranteed load on the nuclear power plants, but also ensure that companies can attract extra funds. Therefore, it would open the way to a fundamentally new economy, new approaches, a new market model,\u201D said the ministry.","Ukraine has been optimistic about the crypto mining sector.
