Earlier this month, before spot bitcoin ETFs were approved, he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270976\/spot-bitcoin-etf-inflows-standard-chartered-bank\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> those funds are expected to attract inflows of $50-100 billion this year, and as a result, the bitcoin price could rise to $100,000 by the end of the year and $200000 by the end of 2025.","The $100,000 price prediction \"still looks achievable,\" Kendrick said in today's report, adding that expected steady inflows in spot bitcoin ETFs will gradually raise the bitcoin price.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/prices\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin price<\/a> declined after spot bitcoin ETF approvals, mainly due to outflows from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), but has since bounced back and is currently trading at around $43,540.","Kendrick said ether is less susceptible to the post-approval selling that bitcoin saw. \"The key reason for this is that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust has a smaller share of total ETH market cap than GBTC did before approval of BTC ETFs; and within that, FTX holdings are even lower,\" he noted.","On May 23, Kendrick only expects simple Ethereum ETFs that replicate ether price movements to get approved, while ETFs that include staking yield rewards may be introduced later, he said.","\"Both types exist in Europe; AETH [21Shares Ethereum Staking ETP] is the largest ETF that includes staking yield rewards. However, given that AETH has higher fees than ETH, staking rewards are offset by fees,\" he said.","Kendrick also commented on Ethereum's upcoming Dencun or Proto-Danksharding upgrade and said it would benefit the ether price. \"Overall, this upgrade should see more value captured within the ETH ecosystem as lower Layer 2 fees make ETH more competitive, and slower staking should keep staking rewards higher for longer. Both of these are positive for ETH prices,\" he concluded.","As a whole, crypto <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/274853\/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-2025-2026-td-cowen\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">experts<\/a> have been both optimistic and pessimistic that a spot ether ETF approval is on the horizon.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
