That revelation was so fatal to confidence in the exchange that FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy just nine days later (the coverage also, incidentally, won CoinDesk two awards for journalism).","Yet seeing FTX\u2019s toxic internal arrangements failed to deter BlockFi, which collapsed a few weeks after FTX, BlockFi creditors claim.","\u201CBlockFi had the exact same balance sheet published by CoinDesk \u2026.before it placed any of the cryptocurrency placed on the FTX\/Alameda platform in the second half of 2022,\u201D the Friday filing by creditors said, adding that BlockFi\u2019s investment \u2013 including nearly $900 million re-lent to Alameda between July and September 2022 \u2013 is \u201Cmoney that now may be irretrievable.\u201D","BlockFi \u201Cfailed to complete basic due diligence\u201D on Bankman-Fried\u2019s empire, offering \u201Cspecial treatment for FTT and Alameda\u2026 that cast risk management principles entirely to the wind,\u201D added the report, based on a review of 30,000 internal documents, and interviews and depositions with key individuals including founder and chief executive Zac Prince.","Warnings from BlockFi\u2019s own internal risk committee went unheeded or were overruled by Prince, who, instead of increasing collateral requirements, said the company should \u201Coffer terms that we think the client [Alameda] could say yes to,\u201D the filing said.","Blockfi had also misled investors about its risk management strategies, asset concentration and the honoring of customer withdrawals, the filing added.","Creditors have previously argued they should be allowed to file their own plans to wind up the company, accusing BlockFi management of \u201Cextortion\u201D by delaying proceedings to ensure they can negotiate a legal release from personal liability.","In an emailed statement, BlockFi told CoinDesk it \u201Cdisagrees with the Committee\u2019s report,\u201D and cited its own July 10 filing, which said that none of BlockFi management had misused client funds for their own purposes, or directed transactions without reasonable understanding of the risk.","\u201CThe Special Committee has not uncovered any evidence that the Released Parties knew, should have known, or reasonably could have known, about FTX\u2019s and Alameda\u2019s true nature\u201D and any legal claims \u201Cdo not justify prosecution from a cost\/benefit perspective,\u201D the July 10 filing on behalf of the company said.","Read more: \u2018End the Extortion:\u2019 BlockFi Creditors File to Liquidate Estate","Edited by Marc Hochstein."],"entity":[{"type":"$900 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"July 10","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FTT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"The Special Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Zac Prince","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"nine days later","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinDesk \u2026","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u2019s Committee of Unsecured Creditors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Marc Hochstein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alameda","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nov. 2","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"September 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"second half of 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Liquidate Estate","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","BlockFi","Bankruptcy","FTX"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
