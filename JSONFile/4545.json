We're in conversations with advisers here. We're going through our registration processes in certain states where we're talking to regulators as well to look at how we could establish ourselves and respond to that client demand.\u201D","Zodia Markets is backed by SC Ventures, the innovation and ventures unit of Standard Chartered Bank, and BC Technology Group, a digital asset company and parent of digital asset platform OSL.","The firm is non-custodial and instead has a sister company name Zodia Custody for that purpose, Ahmad told The Block\u2019s Frank Chaparro in a podcast recording.","\u201CWe deliberately set up the businesses that way,\u201D Ahmad said. \u201CThe fully integrated, vertically integrated crypto asset firms that offer custody of a trading offer, prop trading, the whole kind of gamut as it related to institutional adoption, that wouldn't necessarily work for institutions looking to get into digital assets or scale them like they trade other asset classes. So we very clearly set up two businesses that are distinct in nature, legally distinct, separate shareholdings.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For more of Chaparro\u2019s interview with Ahmad, watch out for an upcoming episode of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/podcasts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Scoop podcast<\/a>.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
