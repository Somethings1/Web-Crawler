And really what drove that was just the adoption,\u201D said&nbsp;Herman Narula, Improbable\u2019s CEO. \u201CIt\u2019s all about going from building games to building experiences which are game-like but which live within a metaverse context.\u201D","Improbable said last week that it had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/09\/26\/softbank-backed-improbable-slashes-losses-by-85percent-after-metaverse-pivot.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cut losses to £19 million<\/a> ($23 million) in the 2022 fiscal year, down from a whopping £131 million ($159 million) the previous year, while revenues more than doubled to £78 million ($95 million) in the period.","The improved performance is the direct result of its metaverse pivot, according to Narula. The business&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20220407005101\/en\/Improbable-Raises-US150m-to-Establish-M%C2%B2-MSquared-a-Metaverse-Network-and-Ecosystem-Powered-by-Its-Morpheus-Technology\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $150 million<\/a> to establish a network of interoperable metaverses named MSquared in April 2022, with a16z and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 both investing alongside others. It then&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/e0e7cf90-0c5e-4a56-8285-9d36f8c43264\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised another $100 million<\/a> led by Elrond, the blockchain firm, later that year.","The idea was to give brands and companies a way to roll out their own metaverse experiences and events, with tech that could also sync up with blockchains and web3 projects. Improbable's clients range from soccer teams to crypto projects like Yuga Labs \u2014 creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club \u2014 which is working on a metaverse named Otherside.&nbsp;","Improbable has two virtual events scheduled in the next few weeks \u2014 one a watch party for a Major League Baseball game, the other&nbsp;a metaverse party for soccer fans. Big brands in sport, however, are not necessarily wedded to the term metaverse.","\u201COn the one hand, the hyped metaverse has kind of died down,\u201D Narula said. \u201CBut a lot of the people we\u2019re trying to solve problems for, they don\u2019t care if we call it metaverse.\u201D","\u201CThey just want to build interactive experiences for people that scale. They don\u2019t really care if it\u2019s called that.\u201D","Narula has strong views on how crypto projects should think about branching out into the metaverse. Most projects are not so well capitalized as Yuga, which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from venture capitalists and through NFT sales. Most, therefore, should not aim to build vast, virtual worlds to populate with blockchain-linked IP, per Narula.&nbsp;","\u201CFor the vast majority of NFT projects, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best transition,\u201D Narula said. \u201CThe right model is ship something every week, ship something constantly with the community. That\u2019s the power I think of the NFT space and why I think the most interesting stuff we\u2019ve done has been really rapidly put out.\u201D<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/strong>","© 2023 The Block.
