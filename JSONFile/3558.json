Sherrod Brown told The Block: \u201CThe problems of crypto migrating into traditional banking systems is a concern that a lot of us have had and likely will continue to have.\u201D","In his opening statement, Brown cast a widely critical net as the hearing began:","The committee members who wished to express skepticism over crypto\u2019s incursions into the financial system largely bounced their questions off of Angela Walch, a law professor at St. Mary\u2019s University. Walch warned of increasing risk as the crypto industry became more entwined in traditional finance. She envisioned a scenario in which a software bug in Ethereum \u201Ccould ripple through those links to the traditional financial system.\u201D","Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/112654\/sen-elizabeth-warren-pushes-for-tighter-crypto-rules-in-new-letter-to-yellen\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">become vocally critical<\/a> of the crypto industry in recent months, was one who brought Walch\u2019s argument to the fore.","\u201CThere is no question that our financial system needs change \u2014 big structural change \u2014 and we should be willing to consider how these new technologies can help that system,\u201D said Warren, before asking Walch: \u201CHas your research shown that crypto is decentralized in this way?\u201D","Walch said that \u201Cthere are absolutely pockets of power within these systems, particularly the core software developers and the huge miners,\u201D to which Warren gave the appraisal: \u201Cthat sounds to me like a lousy tradeoff.\u201D","Despite continued skepticism towards crypto\u2019s financial utility, particularly from the Democrats of the committee, the hearing was broadly about parsing out broader applications. In doing so, the committee members appeared to demonstrate a new level of knowledge.","\u201CIt\u2019s very clear that members of the Senate Banking committee have become much more sophisticated in their understanding of cryptocurrency and crypto networks,\u201D noted the Blockchain Association\u2019s Kristin Smith.","Senator Brown, for example, noted: \u201CSome of these underlying technologies may have useful applications, beyond evasion of banking and securities laws \u2014 those are generally applications outside of finance.\u201D He went on to praise Filecoin as an example of such a technology.","Ranking Member Pat Toomey applauded blockchain\u2019s role in, for example, preserving Apple Daily\u2019s publications from censorship by the Chinese government. He also signaled approval for various roles of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as media of exchange or stores of value.","\u201CWith cryptocurrencies, making payments and conducting transactions may become cheaper, easier, and faster for consumers than it is using traditional currencies,\u201D he said.","This line of thinking benefited greatly from the presence of Marta Belcher, who chairs the Filecoin Foundation and who was a late-stage addition to the witness list. Filecoin\u2019s use case \u2014 decentralizing massive data storage farms owned by traditional tech giants with a token that can clearly go where the dollar cannot in terms of programmability \u2014 was met with sympathy from both sides of the aisle.","\u201CThe vast majority of data,\u201D said Belcher, \u201CSit in warehouses owned by three companies: AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.\u201D Comparing cryptocurrency to the internet of the 90s, Belcher concluded \u201CI would urge the Committee to embrace the possibility that cryptocurrency\u2019s uses might be just as expansive.\u201D","The third witness, CoinCenter\u2019s Jerry Brito, was also persuasive in favor of decentralized economies based on crypto. Nowhere was that clearer than the mining dispute.","The environmental impact of proof-of-work mining, especially of the Bitcoin network, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/108494\/cbdc-central-banks-hearings-congress-june\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">figured heavily in recent hearings<\/a> on crypto. On Tuesday, Walch leaned heavily into criticism of miners for the power to arrange transactions in decentralized finance, which seemed to catch many on the committee off-guard.","\u201CMiners cannot redirect, steal or initiate user payments. They can however affect the order in which a payment enters the block,\u201D explained Brito. \u201CThis is not a problem in the general case of a person sending money to another person. It can be a problem on decentralized exchanges running on, for example, Ethereum, where decentralized finance traders position their orders first. The same problem happens with traditional finance.\u201D","But as to what will come out of this hearing, there seemed to be no near-term legislative conclusions, despite efforts by, especially, Senator Warren to push the subject forward with regulators.","\u201CI don\u2019t sense that there\u2019s an immediate plan for action or immediate legislation,\u201D observed Smith."],"hashtag":[]}
