In the interview, Morris stated there was \u201Cno way\u201D Tron\u2019s blockchain could handle the transaction volume on BitTorrent.","Morris is now taking his deep knowledge of peer-to-peer content distribution networks to Ara.","Tony Mugavero, CEO of Ara, tells The Block that Morris joined the company because he wanted content creators to join in the success of distributed content sharing platforms, like BitTorrent. BitTorrent, Mugavero explains, \u201Cdoesn\u2019t incentivize people to be fans of the network.\u201D","In a press release shared with The Block, Morris states that \u201Cthe BitTorrent ecosystem evolved into a consumer-dominated insurgency which cut out not just middle-men but creators too,\u201D adding that \u201CAra is aiming to leverage the power of blockchain and p2p technologies to build a more sustainable and equitable digital content ecosystem for everyone.\u201D","Unlike BitTorrent, which has often <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Legal_issues_with_BitTorrent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Legal_issues_with_BitTorrent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">operated<\/a> in the gray areas of copyright laws where users can download copyrighted content without paying for it, Ara is going a different route.","On Ara, consumers will offer their unused computing storage capacity to host and distribute content on behalf of content creators. In return, Ara\u2019s platform rewards these consumers with 10 percent of the revenue generated from the sale of content. The remaining 90 percent will go straight to the content creators. Ara will likely also introduce a reputation feature to track the movement of content and flag illegal downloads.","Traditional content creators and publishers often face a content distribution problem. Publishers can either distribute their content through third-party distribution services or sell their content directly to consumers. The problem with the former is the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/11\/30\/18120577\/valve-steam-game-marketplace-revenue-split-new-rules-competition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/11\/30\/18120577\/valve-steam-game-marketplace-revenue-split-new-rules-competition\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">high fees<\/a> these third-parties charge. The problem with the latter is the high cost of developing infrastructure to self-host and distribute. Ara believes its platform provides a solution.","\u201CBitTorrent was only used for one thing: people steal content, and that\u2019s it,\u201D Mugavero said. He argues that by contrast, Ara enables publishers to control their content and distribution and allows consumers to generate revenue from renting their unused storage space.","Early testing of Ara\u2019s network, however, shows sparse interest in the service, with only 30 to 40 companies testing out its platform. However, Ara is currently in its early stages of development. Mugavero tells The Block that Ara will soon leverage its historical business connections with production studios like NBC Studios to onboard new content creators, noting the firm has \u201Cpaper agreements\u201D with movie studios and broadcast networks.","Whether Ara can succeed in changing human nature for wanting free content, is to be seen, but the addition of Simon Morris as an advisor might prove fruitful.","© 2023 The Block.
