The feature will enable users to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189496\/ethereum-client-teams-test-staking-withdrawals-on-devnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">unstake their staked ether tokens<\/a> once the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/204639\/developers-finalize-first-shadow-fork-for-ethereums-shanghai-upgrade\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Shanghai upgrade<\/a> happens.","The Lido team described the designing process for the withdrawal feature as a complex task. This complexity is due to the way staked ether withdrawals will work following the Shanghai upgrade. The process will be asynchronous, which means withdrawals won\u2019t happen at the same time for all participants.","Lido\u2019s planned withdrawal feature will have two modes, the design <a href=\"https:\/\/hackmd.io\/@lido\/SyaJQsZoj#Lido-on-Ethereum-Withdrawals-Landscape\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">document<\/a> stated. The first mode called \u201Cturbo\u201D will process unstaking requests as quickly as possible while the \u201Cbunker\u201D mode will be triggered under mass slashing conditions. Slashing is a penalty incurred by validators in a proof-of-stake network when they run foul of consensus rules. In Ethereum, validators get penalized by having a portion of their staked tokens burned. Lido\u2019s bunker mode aims to prevent sophisticated actors from profiting at the expense of the community, the design document added.","For Lido, the withdrawal feature is an important aspect of its operations going forward. Lido is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/154089\/lido-dao-begins-voting-on-whether-to-limit-its-ethereum-staking-dominance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">most dominant liquid staking protocol<\/a> on Ethereum. The project accounts for 29% of all staked ether, according to a Dune <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/hildobby\/ETH2-Deposits\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dashboard<\/a>.","Lido DAO will deliberate on the design specifics in the coming days. The community will vote on any new recommendations before the plans will be implemented in the protocol.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
