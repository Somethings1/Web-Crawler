It was not lost on members of the subcommittee that, very possibly due to media dynamics, crypto had seemingly upstaged such concerns as ESG reporting and tightened insider trading, which had been at the core of the Biden administration\u2019s agenda for the regulator.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Congress was dissatisfied with the SEC\u2019s enforcement work in crypto, though for inverse reasons. Democrats indicated more support for expanded enforcement against crypto firms. Sherman, a longstanding crypto critic, was at the vanguard of this, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/158491\/us-rep-brad-sherman-urges-sec-to-go-after-crypto-exchanges-that-had-traded-in-xrp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pushing for more SEC action against crypto exchanges themselves.<\/a><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf XRP is a security, then every exchange that handles XRP is a securities exchange.
