But public records show the FTX co-founder, who has come under investigation by law enforcement the exchange's collapse and been criticized by the company's new leadership for lack of record-keeping, reporting $320,400 in donations to Republicans and Republican-aligned groups, according to CREW.&nbsp;","\u201CAll my Republican donations were dark. The reason was not the regulatory reason. It\u2019s because reporters freak the fuck out if you donate to a Republican because they\u2019re all super liberal. And I didn\u2019t want to have that fight,\u201D Bankman-Fried said in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6DezodR9hNI\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interview<\/a>.","Bankman-Fried\u2019s comments about intentionally concealing political donations could be evidence he violated the Federal Election Campaign Act, according to the watchdog group, since donations above $200 to influence election outcomes must be disclosed by the donor, and the correct person who funded the donation must be named. Millions of dollars-worth of political donations made by other FTX executives, some to Republicans, have also come under scrutiny since the corporate empire's rapid collapse.&nbsp;","\u201CMr. Bankman-Fried\u2019s frankness amounts to an admission that he, and other unknown persons, violated federal laws designed to ensure Americans have transparency into those funding elections,\u201D the group said in its complaint.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> \"Federal laws against straw contributions, however, prohibit such schemes where the original contributor intends their funds to influence elections and routes the money through intermediaries to the recipient who then fails to disclose the original source.\"<\/span>","The complaint names Bankman-Fried and the \u201Cother unknown persons,\u201D he donated to. It\u2019s unclear how much money Bankman-Fried actually gave to dark money groups, or which organizations received donations. The organizations do not report donations, and a Bankman-Fried spokesperson did not share the size and scope of his Republican political giving.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
