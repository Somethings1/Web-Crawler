They are bracing for a legal battle, watching the Umami token price fall and tracking the drama on social platforms like Discord and Twitter.","\u201CIn a lot of ways, DAOs work great until there's a conflict and a dispute,\u201D said Nelson Rosario, a partner at Rosario Tech Law who focuses on blockchain and crypto issues. \u201CIn situations when conflict arises, it can be problematic for participants in the DAO, because either an explicit or kind of natural hierarchy usually emerges in moments of conflict, and what the exact kind of boundaries are with respect to who does or doesn't have legal rights is not always clear.\u201D","Umami Labs bills itself as a project that is \u201Cpioneering institutional DeFi\u201D by creating \u201Cregulatory-compliant, non-custodial DeFi strategies for financial institutions in the U.S. and beyond.\u201D","The company acts as the legal entity that runs operations and develops products for Umami DAO. It is helmed by CEO Alex O\u2019Donnell, an early Umami DAO contributor and former Reuters News journalist.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Umami Labs had planned to launch its first DeFi product last week, a \u201Cnon-custodial, institutional-grade strategy for generating competitive risk-adjusted returns on assets including $USDC, $ETH and $BTC.\u201D<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The project never got that far.","Last month, nearly all of Umami Lab\u2019s employees quit their jobs, accusing O\u2019Donnell of trying to take control of Umami\u2019s $5.9 million <a href=\"https:\/\/zapper.xyz\/daos\/umami-finance-dao\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">treasury<\/span><\/a>. O\u2019Donnell, meanwhile, says the former Umami Labs employees are actually the ones who seized Umami\u2019s treasury and intellectual property \u2014 and violated their employment contracts.","\u201CI have an obligation to restore the assets to their legal entity home on behalf of token holders,\u201D O\u2019Donnell said in an exclusive interview with The Block. \u201CWe're going to get them back. There's no real question about that.\u201D<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","O\u2019Donnell retained the law firm Jenner &amp; Block to represent himself and Ievgeniia Vatrenko to represent Umami Labs. But the CEO and Umami\u2019s former employees are hoping to come to an agreement outside of a courtroom instead.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Lawyers for O\u2019Donnell and former Umami Labs executives had a two-hour meeting earlier this month to lay out how negotiations can proceed. They later initiated arbitration proceedings.","The parties \u201Cestablished a framework in principle within which the parties are hopeful they will be able to negotiate an amicable resolution to the ongoing dispute. The attorneys are still working out the details,\u201D O\u2019Donnell said in a statement.","A community manager for Umami DAO confirmed that some DAO contributors have hired lawyers, and that the individuals are paying for their own legal counsel.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The conflict at Umami Labs boiled over in January, weeks before Umami\u2019s new product was set to launch. By mid-February, all of the project\u2019s 11 employees had quit.","\u201CThe entire team gradually lost faith in his leadership and vision, including the community managers and developers. They felt that the token holders' wishes were not being considered and that Mr. O'Donnell's vision was far from being in their best interests,\u201D Alex Golubitsky, the former chief legal officer at Umami Labs, said in an email to The Block. Golubitsky was suspended from his role in January and later terminated.","O\u2019Donnell disputes accusations that he was trying to take control of the treasury. Instead, O\u2019Donnell says the conflict at the heart of the Umami breakup were his and Golubitsky\u2019s conflicting visions for the future structure of the project.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Internal Umami Labs Slack messages shared with The Block show O\u2019Donnell and Golubitsky butted heads on whether to make changes to Umami\u2019s offerings and whether to bring in outside counsel.","\u201CI had these concerns about our overall legal entity structure and our strategy. I wanted to take a second look at things to see where we could have to improve. We had a product launch scheduled in March, so the clock was ticking to make any revisions before we launched our product. And it was in that context we had that conflict with the chief legal officer,\u201D O\u2019Donnell said, adding that Golubitsky tried to block him from bringing in an outside lawyer to review Umami\u2019s legal structure.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","It would be legally impossible to seize the Umami treasury, O\u2019Donnell says, because of multi-signature agreements needed to take action at the company. The multi-sig contracts, along with other employment contracts, have been reviewed by The Block.","\u201CI couldn't have stolen the treasury assets even if I wanted to, because you need those three sign-offs,\u201D O\u2019Donnell said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Around the same time, the Umami Labs employees quit their jobs and O\u2019Donnell sold his tokens, cashing them out for approximately half a million dollars and sending the token price down to $8.29. O\u2019Donnell told The Block he sold the tokens to gear up for what might be a costly legal battle.","\u201CI was told that there was going to be no coverage for legal fees, which of course, was going to be really important to try to remedy this,\u201D O\u2019Donnell said. \u201CI took my personal allocation of tokens that had already been invested to my wallet \u2026 and I sold it, you know, ultimately at a pretty steep discount so that I could raise the funds as quickly as possible for the legal defense that was going to be needed for Umami.\"","Golubitsky called the move \u201Can unforgivable betrayal.\u201D The Umami token has since recovered to $12.52 as of Wednesday afternoon.","\u201CSimply put, Mr. O\u2019Donnell wished to take control over the Umami treasury for his personal ends. When it became clear to Mr. O\u2019Donnell that he would be unable to use Umami Labs as a vehicle to gain control over the treasury of Umami DAO, he liquidated his large holdings of $Umami tokens,\u201D Golubitsky said. \u201CThis was an unforgivable betrayal of the trust of the Umami community and of the policies of Umami Labs.\u201D","In the weeks since the Umami Labs fiasco came to a head, the Umami DAO <a href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/umamidao.eth\/proposal\/0x97e2f9a9dfefc22fb63e759fcb67c4fd0275572476701731bdd178d261d425f7\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">voted<\/span><\/a> in nine former Umami Labs employees to continue the project. Developers are still working on bringing the new product to fruition, but some token holders say they are stuck in limbo.","\u201CThe token holders are kind of in the middle of this and they just want it to end in a way that benefits them. So that would mean that the product can still launch and the token holders are able to also have a say in, \u2018Okay, what is the solution?\u2019\u201D said Stan Colenbrander, a cryptocurrency researcher and Umami token holder.","O\u2019Donnell, who is still negotiating with his former employees, says he is doubtful that the project will meet its goal of attracting institutional users in the U.S. and other big markets, and may only appeal to DeFi-native users.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CWithout the legal structure put in place under Umami Labs, LLC, it's less likely to reach institutional users, as had been originally intended,\u201D O\u2019Donnell said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The conflict at Umami Labs also underscores the limits of decentralization and smart contracts when human beings are involved, noted Rosario, the crypto lawyer who is not involved in the conflict. It is hard for DAOs to \u201Cbe flexible enough to deal with the infinite dispute universe.\u201D","\u201CSmart contracts are great for the things that you can code in that are regular and kind of expected. It's when you have to get into the flexibility of human insanity. Good luck,\u201D Rosario said.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
