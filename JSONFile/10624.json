It could even be like $180,000.\"","Lee noted that this price prediction hinges on a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved in the United States \u2014 not overseas, where one was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244913\/spot-bitcoin-etf-jacobi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">listed<\/a> yesterday.","To date, the U.S. SEC has only denied or delayed applications after years of attempts from companies to list the first spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 and some don't believe the agency, in its current form, is likely to change course. Former SEC Office of Internet Enforcement chief John Reed Stark, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244597\/sec-bitcoin-etf-john-reed-stark\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">believes<\/a> one is unlikely to be approved under the Biden administration.","If a spot Bitcoin ETF does not get approved, Lee still noted that the leading cryptocurrency has upside potential due to its upcoming planned daily supply reduction \u2014 known as The Halving.
