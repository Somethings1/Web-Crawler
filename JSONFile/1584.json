{"summary":"A new proposal wants to destroy another rare item and turn it into NFTs. It\u2019s time to put an end to this.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/130797\/what-is-it-with-nfts-and-destroying-real-world-items","publishDate":"2022-01-19T12:04:36","id":1584,"type":null,"title":"What is it with NFTs and destroying real-world items?","category":["NFTS"],"content":["NFTs have come under a lot of criticism for \u201Cdestroying the planet\u201D &nbsp;\u2014 a debatable topic that should largely disappear when Ethereum switches consensus mechanisms this year and its impact on the environment shrinks.","But what\u2019s definitely being destroyed are real-world assets as their owners recreate them using NFTs, in the hope of selling them for more money.","It\u2019s a habit that, quite frankly, needs to stop.","The first major example of this was when NFT platform Burnt Finance literally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C4wm-p_VFh0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">burned<\/a> a certified Banksy piece called Morons before recreating it as an NFT and selling it for $400,000 \u2014 four times more than the physical artwork was valued.","Then, the owner of a drawing by Jean-Michel Basquiat offered an NFT of the artwork for sale, with the option that, at the buyer\u2019s wishes, the original could be destroyed. Luckily, this was duly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theartnewspaper.com\/2021\/04\/28\/basquiat-nft-withdrawn-from-auction-after-artists-estate-intervenes\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cancelled<\/a> after the estate said that the owner did not have the rights to create such a derivative piece.","A few months later, the founder of audiobook platform MySoundWise, Natasha Che, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaschaLabs\/status\/1429576700346748938\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a>: \u201CIf you make a NFT of a real diamond, and the diamond itself gets destroyed in a fire tomorrow, you still have the same asset.\u201D After much mockery of this idea, Che set out to do exactly that. She bought a diamond for $5,000, smashed it with a hammer and sold an NFT of it for $17,600. (Although the jury\u2019s still out on whether this exactly proved her point.)","While there haven\u2019t been too many victims of this tokenization trend, the idea is still present and keeps cropping up. The latest proposal is to destroy a rare book and it has certainly ruffled some feathers.","In November, 2021, NFT collector Soban Saqib spent $2.9 million on a rare copy of the book Dune \u2014 one that was presented in order to sell the idea of turning it into a screenplay \u2014&nbsp;according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeednews.com\/article\/amansethi\/spicedao-dunedao-soby\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Buzzfeed<\/a>. He did so on behalf of SpiceDAO, a group of crypto enthusiasts pooling their funds together, in a similar vein to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/124288\/a-dao-is-trying-to-buy-a-rare-print-of-the-us-constitution\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">plan to buy an early copy<\/a> of the US Constitution.&nbsp;","The group was excited by the purchase and had big plans for it. They <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheSpiceDAO\/status\/1482404318347153413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1482404318347153413%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theartnewspaper.com%2F2022%2F01%2F17%2Fnft-group-shamed-jodorowsky-dune-book-copyright\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">intended<\/a> to make the book public, produce an animated series inspired by the book and to support community-driven derivative projects based on it.&nbsp;","Only there was a big flaw: they own the book but not the copyright. This means that the group will struggle to achieve any of the three presented ideas.","While the group appears to be <a href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/dunedao.eth\/proposal\/0x2038fc240d0e85c496cc692d0001fb159d6f613b546392aa96e49a3b752ced0d\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">continuing down<\/a> its path regardless, one of its community members has proposed an <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.spicedao.xyz\/t\/nft-of-the-book-w-proof-of-jpeg-proof-of-burn\/48\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">alternative solution<\/a> (although one not necessarily void of the same problems).&nbsp;","As you may have guessed, he wants to destroy the book.","The person who proposed the idea is a former electrical engineer who goes by the moniker Xatarrer. They're known for trying to upload a 1 MB image to the Ethereum blockchain through a series of progressive uploads (with each successive image improving in quality). A project that\u2019s so far about 25% there.","Xatarrer wants to apply a similar idea to the Dune book. Except that unlike most NFTs that simply store links to images stored elsewhere on the web, they want to upload images of every page of the book in their entirety to the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;","It\u2019s unclear how many pages there are in the book, but at Xatarrer\u2019s estimates it will cost 18 ETH ($56,000) to upload each page in terms of transaction fees. So if the book has 200 pages, that would cost $11.2 million to create the NFTs.","Once the book has been uploaded to the blockchain in its entirety, it would be available for anyone to access. This would include all of the pages, which is slightly more than what is currently available online (uploaded to just the normal web) but not by a huge amount \u2014 begging the question whether it's really worth it.","And then, Xatarrer proposed, the book could be destroyed as an \u201Cincredible marketing stunt\u201D with the goal of enhancing the value of the on-chain images of the book.","They told The Block that in the DAO's early days, many members joked about doing this and he thought he would create a serious proposal with the burning of the book as an option. \"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It is my belief that on-chain storage is more likely to survive than the physical object itself. Also it aligns well with a book about science fiction,\" they said.<\/span>","Only the proposal was not received well.","\u201CAnd we wonder why people hate crypto. I'm ashamed to have enabled someone to even think about doing this,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/peter_szilagyi\/status\/1483016569961730050\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a> Ethereum tech lead Péter Szilágyi.&nbsp;","Rotki app founder Lefteris Karapetsas agreed. He <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LefterisJP\/status\/1483044565061980160\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>, \u201CUs non-normies here think that this is a really bad move. Some of the stuff you lay out in that post is really cool. Don't let it be smeared by actually destroying the physical copy of the book.\u201D","It seems that with this backlash, the proposal to burn the book is unlikely to catch hold. Xatarrer <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Xatarrer\/status\/1483064469718650880\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>, \u201CIt says (optional) in the proposal and so far the sentiment is quite negative, so I don't think you need to worry about the book.\u201D","So, at least this time, the rare artifact should be safe.","But perhaps it's the idea of burning rare items like books \u2014 in the hope of making a bit of extra cash \u2014 that should be destroyed instead.","© 2023 The Block.
