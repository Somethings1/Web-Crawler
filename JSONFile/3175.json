The feature will allow subnets to share data and crypto assets with each other in an effort to make the Avalanche blockchain ecosystem more useful for developers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Before the upgrade, Avalanche already allowed developers to write custom blockchains or subnets for different use cases in the Go and Rust programming languages. However these subnets couldn\u2019t communicate with each other until now without the use of complex bridge systems, meaning they largely remained isolated from one another. This is where Banff 5 comes in with Avalanche Warp Messaging to enable what\u2019s described as \u201Cseamless native communication\u201D between subnets to transfer assets or data across different subnets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The upgrade eliminates the need for individual subnet projects to deploy and manage their own bridges. The mechanism also holds the potential to open the door for new use cases such as cross-chain staking of tokens, the Avalanche team said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAvalanche Warp Messaging (AWM) is the catalyst that will spark a Cambrian explosion of Avalanche subnet development,\u201D said Patrick O\u2019Grady, head of engineering at Ava Labs. \u201CWith this release, you can launch your own Go- or Rust-based blockchain and reward any node that stakes your own token for validating it, all while natively interoperating with an ecosystem of other builders doing the same thing.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The subnet messaging employs the use of an advanced cryptographic tool called \u201C<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/crypto.stanford.edu\/~dabo\/pubs\/papers\/BLSmultisig.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BLS multi signatures\u201D<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to verify messages and data across chains. To make use of the protocol, the security validators of any subnet can generate a BLS signature which attests the request to send assets or data over to another subnet. The very same message can be verified by any other subnets in the Avalanche ecosystem to initiate the native transfer of data or assets. Ava Labs said it made the first native subnet-to-subnet message on Thursday. <\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
