This NFT is signed by Berners-Lee and contains his original time stamped files.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhy an NFT? Well, it's a natural thing to do as when you're a computer scientist and when you write code and have been for many years. It feels right to digitally sign my autograph on a completely digital artefact,\u201D he added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The NFT has a few other elements: an animated visualization of the code, a letter Berners-Lee wrote about the code and his process of creating it, a digital \u201Cposter\u201D of the entire code from the original files using Python, which also includes a graphic of his physical signature, and all of it is digitally signed.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The files referenced by the NFT contain about 9,555 lines of code, which include parts of the three languages and one protocol Berners-Lee invented: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and URLs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThree decades ago, I created something which, with the subsequent help of a huge number of collaborators across the world, has been a powerful tool for humanity,\u201D said Berners-Lee in a statement. \u201CNFTs, be they artworks or a digital artefact like this, are the latest playful creations in this realm, and the most appropriate means of ownership that exists. They are the ideal way to package the origins behind the web.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">All proceeds of the sale will go to initiatives that Berners-Lee and his wife support.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The sale marks Sotheby\u2019s third auction involving NFTs.
