The move is part of an effort by the administration to unify the many federal departments and agencies that touch cryptocurrency.","The White House is \u201Claying the groundwork for a thoughtful, comprehensive approach to mitigating digital assets\u2019 acute risks and\u2014where proven\u2014harnessing their benefits,\u201D top White House economic policy advisor Brian Deese said in a statement on Friday.","\u201CWe remain committed to working with allies, partners, and the broader digital asset community to shape the future of this ecosystem,\u201D said Deese, the director of the National Economic Council.","But much of the digital asset community Deese referenced panned the effort, saying it fell short of providing a clear path forward on U.S. policy towards digital assets, at least for now. The reaction is unsurprising, given the administration\u2019s call for regulators to \u201Caggressively pursue\u201D enforcement actions within the industry.","Officials coordinating the reports, who asked not to be directly identified during the briefing portion of a Thursday press call, said existing laws governing the financial sector were sufficient to regulate digital assets. That\u2019s the exact opposite of the message from industry groups in Washington, though senior officials speaking to press expressed that clearer guidance should be issued around the still-nascent asset class.","The Blockchain Association, one of the largest digital asset industry groups, said the new reports lack \u201Csubstantive recommendations.\u201D","Executive Director Kristin Smith called the reports \u201Ca missed opportunity to cement U.S. crypto leadership\u201D in a statement, and criticized them as focused too much on the risks of cryptocurrencies.","The reports were \u201Coutdated and unbalanced\u201D in the eyes of Crypto Council for Innovation CEO Sheila Warren, who in her own statement criticized what she saw as a lack of clear policy recommendations. <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/strong>","At least one company in the industry cheered the new reports.","\u201CWe are pleased that the administration is directing federal agencies to better enforce existing laws on the books,\u201D said Ben Gray, the general counsel and chief compliance offer at Paxos Trust Company, in a statement.","Rep. Jim Himes, a crypto-friendly lawmaker who has proposed legislation for a digital dollar, also praised the reports during a telephone interview with The Block.","\u201CI\u2019m glad for the momentum,\u201D said Himes. \u201CI didn\u2019t come away with an awful lot in the way of specific recommendations.\u201D","On the other side of the aisle, senior Republicans were unimpressed.","Rep. Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, knocked the reports for not providing more specific actions.","\u201CReports are not a substitute for legislative clarity,\u201D McHenry said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/myemail.constantcontact.com\/McHenry-Statement-on-Biden-Administration-s-Digital-Assets-Reports.html?soid=1133131444985&amp;aid=Zc4ZLeZUsqU\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/a>. \u201CWith clear rules of the road, this innovative technology can revolutionize our financial markets, modernize our payments system infrastructure, and provide new opportunities to consumers.\u201D","McHenry\u2019s Republican counterpart in the Senate echoed the criticism.","\u201CWhile I appreciate the Biden administration\u2019s engagement on digital assets, true regulatory clarity will require much more than just reports,\u201D Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. \u201CWhat\u2019s clearly needed is a comprehensive, tailored framework that allows these new technologies to thrive with appropriate guardrails for consumers.\u201D","Both Toomey and McHenry also took aim at the administration\u2019s decision not to support stablecoin legislation.","\u201CGlaringly absent from these reports is any significant acknowledgment of the benefits that stablecoins\u2014if issued under a clear regulatory framework\u2014can provide to our payments system and consumers,\u201D McHenry said.","McHenry blasted the decision to form an interagency working group to prepare for a possible digital dollar, should the Federal Reserve choose to create one.","\u201CRepublicans have consistently said the benefits of a potential U.S. CBDC must outweigh the risks\u2014these reports fail to make the case,\u201D said McHenry.&nbsp;","A proponent of a digital dollar, Himes felt differently. But like McHenry and Toomey, he saw Congress playing a bigger role than the reports might indicate.","\u201CI continue to believe that the real action is in the Congress right now,\u201D he said.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kollen Post contributed to this report.&nbsp;<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
