Most striking are Blockchain.com and ConsenSys, who have shares on offer at discounts of 74% and 71%, respectively, to their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/137740\/consensys-raises-450-million-series-d-at-7-billion-valuation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">latest funding rounds<\/a>. Chainalysis shares are up for sale at a 61% discount, OpenSea stock is available at a 51% discount and a CoinDCX block is listed at a 47% discount. The Alchemy, Blockdaemon and Kraken shares are discounted by 31%, 30% and 9%, respectively.","Spokespeople for Chainalysis, OpenSea and Blockdaemon declined to comment. The other companies mentioned did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Not every crypto company listed on Birel.io is trading at a discount. Shares in the Bitcoin infrastructure firm Bitfury, for example, are listed at a small premium.","Shares changing hands on Birel.io should not be confused with so-called \u201Cdown rounds\u201D \u2014 when startups raise fresh capital at a lower valuation than they achieved previously. Secondary transactions instead involve existing shareholders selling their shares to new investors.","Nevertheless, they are an indication of investor appetite. Shares in startups in the AI sector, conversely, are generally trading at the price of those firms\u2019 last fundraise or even at a premium, according to Freemanson.","\u201CI cannot say that such discounts speak of commensurate negative results of companies. Discounts are associated with the absence of buyers at higher price levels,\u201D he said of the crypto startup discounts. \u201CBuyers are not active because the results of these companies partially depend on the price of the main cryptocurrency, the movement of which is now difficult to predict. And sellers do not always sell their entire volume, they exit partially for diversification.\u201D","As shown by an email extract sent to a prominent venture capital firm in the U.S. and obtained by The Block, brokers have been proactively reaching out to investors in the crypto sector about the availability of discounted shares.","Ian Wittkopp, COO and head of investment at Sino Global Capital, confirmed that OTC brokers \u201Chave been quite active reaching out to funds to get a range of valuations for large equity fund positions.\u201D Thomas Braziel, a partner at 507 Capital, said he\u2019s \u201Cseeing shares of all kinds of things floating around.\u201D","But Wittkopp added \u2014 in light of the numerous bankruptcies that have shaken up the crypto sector of late \u2014 that the discounts on offer are not necessarily an indictment of the startups prospects and could \u201Csay more about the seller than the position being sold.\u201D","Braziel agrees. \u201CI think it\u2019s really about the current owners \u2014 you know, hedge funds \u2014 needing liquidity,\u201D he said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
