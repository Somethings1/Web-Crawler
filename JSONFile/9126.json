The technology is based on the Diem payments network, which Aptos\u2019 founders worked on while at Meta, formerly known as Facebook.","Glazer and her firm Swoon Capital have been fighting for up to $1 billion from Matonee, also known as Aptos Labs, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/575065054\/650956-2022-Shari-Glazer-Et-Al-v-Mohammad-Shaikh-Et-Al-SUMMONS-COMPLAINT-1-1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">complaint filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York<\/a> in March.&nbsp;","Glazer and Swoon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/147991\/aptos-ceo-faces-billion-dollar-lawsuit-by-glazer-family-member-over-equity\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claimed<\/a> that a \u201Cfraudulent scheme\u201D implemented by Shaikh deprived her of her rightful share of a partnership in a \u201Cblockchain technology venture.\u201D","The latest development in the case has seen a motion to dismiss the lawsuit denied, according to a court transcript <a href=\"https:\/\/iapps.courts.state.ny.us\/nyscef\/ViewDocument?docIndex=lxq6CfSRLeXFO60xen_PLUS_GmA==\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">published on Monday,<\/a> as the judge cast uncertainty on how the dispute would culminate.","\"I can't emphasize enough that both parties here should have significant uncertainty in terms of how this case unwinds,\" said Justice Jennifer Schecter. \"It would behoove the parties to enter into some type of negotiation where they can work something out, limit the uncertainty and acknowledge the roles that everybody have played in connection with this transaction,\" she added.","The court dismissed four legal claims, including fraud, but allowed three others to proceed and be hashed out between the pair\u2014for breach of agreement, unjust enrichment, and Glazer\u2019s entitlement to a 50% stake in Matonee.","\u201CWe are pleased with the court\u2019s ruling in which the majority of Ms. Glazer\u2019s claims were dismissed outright \u2014 despite a high legal standard at this phase of litigation that requires giving Ms. Glazer nearly every benefit of the doubt and requires accepting Ms. Glazer\u2019s allegations at face value,\" an Aptos spokesperson told The Block in an emailed statement.","\"As the facts will show, the claims in Ms. Glazer\u2019s lawsuit are meritless, and we will continue to fight them. We will not allow this lawsuit to distract us from achieving our mission and we will continue to build for the benefit of all.\u201D","The dispute comes as Aptos gears up to launch its blockchain mainnet.","The tech provider has garnered a host of heavyweight backers since its inception.
