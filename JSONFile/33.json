This means users will no longer be able to buy, bid for, or list NFTs on the marketplace, and existing orders will be canceled at that time. Binance also advised users to withdraw their Bitcoin NFTs before 12 a.m. UTC on May 18.","Explicitly referring to Bitcoin-based Runestone NFTs, Binance said users who met the conditions for the recent Runestone airdrop had been distributed the NFTs by April 4 but advised them to withdraw them by April 10 \u201Cto ensure they still have the opportunity to receive any associated tokens, utilities, and benefits.\u201D Binance added that the trading of Runestone NFTs will not be supported during this period.","Bitcoin became the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233265\/binance-adds-bitcoin-nfts-to-its-marketplace-one-day-after-sec-lawsuit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fourth blockchain<\/a> supported by Binance\u2019s NFT marketplace in June 2023.
