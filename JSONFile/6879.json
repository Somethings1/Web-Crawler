And for crypto to really fulfill its destiny, but \u2014 we\u2019ve got to get the U.S. engaged. And so I am, by no means going to flip the middle finger at the regulator. We are trying to engage with politicians and regulators every single day to get to a good place.\u201D<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Novogratz was also asked about a draft <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232983\/republican-draft-bill-would-create-new-definition-of-decentralized-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bill<\/span><\/a> that is trying to provide a pathway for when a token can go from being treated as a security to a commodity, which has lower disclosure requirements.
