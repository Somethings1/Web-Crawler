The higher-than-expected fees on Arbitrum were caused by increased user activity.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The heightened activity has, in part, resulted from an incentivized campaign called Arbitrum Odyssey, a 2-month promotional campaign. In this, Offchain Labs, Arbitrum's development firm, promised NFT rewards to users who interact with various Arbitrum-based DeFi protocols. Airdrop farmers \u2014 those who try to be qualified for future airdrops \u2014 are speculating that these NFTs will later give access to a token airdrop, but this is by no means guaranteed.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Arbitrum team has now paused Odyssey to manage increased congestion and bring down the gas fees. In a Twitter post, the team said that Odyssey will remain halted until Arbitrum deploys Nitro, a new update that will increase its computational capacity. The fees on Arbitrum have since come back down and are now sitting at around the $2 mark at the time of this article.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Per its official blockchain explorer called Arbiscan, the Layer 2 network experienced a 45% increase in daily transactions in the last few weeks.
