The program will be available in all 50 U.S. states, including New York.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gemini.com\/earn\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gemini Earn<\/a> supports all 26 crypto assets the exchange supports on its trading platform, including decentralized finance (DeFi) coins, such as Uniswap and Aave.","The highest yield (7.4%), however, is only available on Filecoin. For the rest of the supported coins, the interest rate ranges from 1.54% to 5.83%.","The most popular cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), each yield 3.05%.","Gemini rival BlockFi, on the other hand, <a href=\"https:\/\/blockfi.com\/rates\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">offers up to 6% interest rate<\/a> on bitcoin deposits and 5.25% for ether deposits. BlockFi's feature, however, supports limited coins and is not available for users based in New York.","Gemini Earn, on the other hand, appears to be riskier. \"Loans made through the Program are unsecured.
