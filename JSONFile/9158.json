Validators that supported the proposal included Game, Informal, Iqlusion, Stakecito, P2P, Polkachu, Pryzm, IrisNet, Leap and more.","This latest proposal followed the accepted Proposal 848, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264683\/cosmos-community-approves-capping-atom-inflation-rate-at-10?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">set a cap<\/a> on the maximum inflation rate at 10%, down from the previous 20%, to regulate token emissions.","On Cosmos, validators vote in addition to building blocks, and voters can delegate their stake to them.","The inflation rate on Cosmos Hub has been a subject of significant discussion for the last year. Some Cosmos contributors want it to be as minimal as possible, which they believe optimizes fresh emissions.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
