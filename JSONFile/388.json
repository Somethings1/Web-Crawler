The thing that caught my eye was that it involved a lawyer who (judging from the pleadings and exhibits) maybe was in slightly deeper waters than she should have been. &nbsp;In short, she was supposed to be an intermediary for a bitcoin transaction and got sent cash, which she forwarded to a third party, but \u2026 never \u2026 got \u2026 the bitcoin. This of course made the buyer really not very happy, and they filed a not very happy lawsuit in federal court in Georgia.","It's been a few months, so I thought I\u2019d check back with our friends and see where, if anything this case had gotten and as far as I can tell it\u2019s still winding its way through the litigation process. &nbsp;There have been multiple discovery fights and there\u2019s a motion to dismiss that is pending. Now what caught my eye about this case is one of the arguments in the motion to dismiss pleadings where I think the plaintiff (that is, the people who paid their money but got no bitoin) made an argument about why their securities fraud claim shouldn\u2019t be dismissed.","They argue that their contract to purchase bitcoin was an investment contract under the Howey Test in part because it \u201Cwas based on the efforts of Valkyrie to mine or otherwise obtain the Bitcoin for sale to GSR Markets for investment purposes.\u201D They aso note that \u201CBitcoin\u201D changes in value quickly, \u201Cunlike a commodity such as money\u201D (which doesn\u2019t actually make sense, I don\u2019t think).","The facts are bad enough in this case that if they\u2019re as alleged I imagine that the Court will find the defendants liable without having to fit a bitcoin escrow contract gone bad into an investment contract. &nbsp;Still, there\u2019s a saying among lawyers that bad cases make bad law \u2014 one hopes that the waters don\u2019t get so muddy that the Court here decides that bitcoin is an investment contract or that a bitcoin escrow is an investment contract but, whelp, one of the funny things about a common law system of judge made law is \u2026 sometimes you never know until the motion is decided.","<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Crypto Caselaw Minute is provided for educational purposes only by Stephen Palley (@stephendpalley) and Nelson Rosario (@nelsonmrosario). &nbsp;These summaries are not legal advice.
