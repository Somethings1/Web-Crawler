Miners will operate this chain separately from the proof-of-stake one. While an official announcement of the fork hasn\u2019t happened yet, here are the key details of what might take place.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The discussion for this miner-led fork started in July with<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/160462\/as-the-ethereum-merge-approaches-a-key-miner-is-pushing-a-proof-of-work-fork\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Chandler Guo<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, an influential Chinese miner, who proposed a hard fork the main Ethereum chain. \u201CI fork Ethereum once, I will fork it again,\u201D Guo <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChandlerGuo\/status\/1552384442580312071\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote <\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on Twitter. The fork, he claimed, would allow miners to continue operations even after Ethereum\u2019s transition rather than be forced to move to other chains.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reportedly, Guo and his supporters \u2014 who are largely <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EthereumPoW\/status\/1564295584701612032\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">remaining anonymous<\/a> \u2014 have been working to carry out this fork of the Ethereum network.

It has tweaked the Ethereum client software Geth to remove the \"difficulty bomb.\" This mechanism was designed by Ethereum core developers to make it much harder to mine blocks, preventing miners from interrupting The Merge.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In addition, the team has launched a testnet called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EthereumPoW\/status\/1563104108457779200\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Iceberg<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> for testing the fork code. It has <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">created a chain ID and remote call procedure (RPC) servers for app frontends to function and connect to the blockchain. Finally, the team <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EthereumPoW\/status\/1561815027169931266\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claims<\/a> to have added replay protection, reducing the risk of transactions applying equally on both chains \u2014 something that would have been a big security risk.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the coming fork, anyone who owns tokens on the Ethereum blockchain will have a version of ether tokens on both blockchains. That doesn't mean the tokens will have equal value \u2014 they may well be worthless on one of the chains. This will include NFTs.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The forked chain will contain all smart contracts copied from the mainnet at the time of the fork, which, in practice, may allow its developers to recreate Ethereum-based applications. But the fork won't bring along any of the developers that built these applications, nor will they be there to maintain them.
