And what role can blockchain play?","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reduce, Protect, Remove <\/strong>","The VCM allows corporations to complement their decarbonization efforts by buying carbon credits voluntarily, each usually representing one tonne of greenhouse gas emissions that has been avoided, reduced or removed (e.g. from reforestation to engineered carbon dioxide removal and sequestration). This flow of capital enables these climate positive activities to scale.","Corporations, asset managers and investors are starting to recognize carbon and ecological assets as a new, diverse and promising asset class.","The quality and price of a carbon credit are influenced by a number of criteria including project type, size, permanence and additional co-benefits. These attributes can be hard to evaluate and de-risk. Due diligence is often complex, time consuming and expensive.","Today's VCM lacks the infrastructure to deliver the necessary levels of transparency, trust, efficiency, liquidity, value and fair pricing for buyers and suppliers. The status quo is inhibiting the growth required to truly help meet climate goals.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">How Can Blockchain Help?<\/strong>","Blockchain technology won\u2019t solve all these issues but can offer a path forward.
