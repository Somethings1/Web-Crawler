Together, these groups represent more than 350 companies.","The FATF <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/109687\/fatf-defers-finalizing-its-crypto-guidance-until-october-industry-players-celebrate-short-term-win\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recently revealed<\/a> that just 58 out of 128 reporting jurisdictions have adopted its standards for regulating crypto firms.&nbsp;","In its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fatf-gafi.org\/publications\/fatfrecommendations\/documents\/second-12-month-review-virtual-assets-vasps.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">second 12-month review<\/a> of the progress made by national regulators, published July 5, the intergovernmental organization stated that \u201Cmany jurisdictions have continued to make progress\u201D implementing its revised standards \u2014 which make so-called Virtual Asset Services Providers (VASPs) subject to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) rules.","Of the 58 regulators that have adopted the standards, 52 are now regulating VASPs and six have banned such operators entirely. 70 jurisdictions are yet to act on the recommendations.","\u201CThese gaps in implementation mean that there is not yet a global regime to prevent the misuse of virtual assets and VASPs for money laundering or terrorist financing,\u201D the FATF stated in a press release.","The FATF has, however, hailed progress in terms of introducing systems to help crypto firms implement its infamous \u2018travel rule\u2019 \u2014 which is technically still in draft form, with finalized guidance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/109687\/fatf-defers-finalizing-its-crypto-guidance-until-october-industry-players-celebrate-short-term-win\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">expected in October,<\/a> following a recent delay.

Why? Because as the Global DeFi Coalition points out in its letter, \u201CDeFi protocols allow individuals to perform a variety of financial transactions electronically on a non-custodial basis without the participation of an intermediary.\u201D","The coalition\u2019s six proposals are outlined in full below."],"hashtag":[]}
