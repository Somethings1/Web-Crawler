Previously, xSushi holders received 0.05% of each swap, 10% of which was directed to the SushiSwap treasury wallet. After the proposal is implemented, the fee ratio has increased from 10% to 100%, leaving no more token rewards for xSushi holders.","This is called Kanpai, SushiSwap\u2019s fee-diversion protocol. It enables the DAO to determine how much of the exchange\u2019s trading fees can be sent to the treasury.&nbsp;","The new Kanpai ratio will last for one year or until the DAO adopts a new tokenomics model. The date of the previous signal vote \u2014 Dec. 19, 2022 \u2014 was chosen as the effective starting date for the new ratio. As such, the Kanpai ratio should revert to its original form on Dec. 19, 2023, unless a new tokenomics model is adopted before then.

Grey stated that diverting fees to the treasury is a better solution than selling sushi tokens to raise funds for the team.","Sushi DAO\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xe94b5eec1fa96ceecbd33ef5baa8d00e4493f4f3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">treasury<\/a> holds $17 million worth of crypto tokens in its reserves. The bulk of this sum \u2014 $16.6 million worth \u2014 is in its native sushi token. The DAO also holds significant amounts of ether and USDC.","Monday\u2019s vote ended with almost unanimous approval from participants, <a href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/sushigov.eth\/proposal\/0x64c5c6cdb74a1ebafe8e808ba69bd51ff70938b7db791ca8a05b37736541d147\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to Snapshot data. The voting page shows 747 wallets participated in the polls, with 99% in support of the move.","GoldenChain, the digital investment arm of venture capital outfit Golden Tree, was largely responsible for the success of the plan.

The signal vote that preceded Monday\u2019s implementation vote turned out to be a whale tussle within the DAO. In the end, GoldenChain and another major voter believed to be owned by crypto trading firm Cumberland were responsible for swaying the polls.","The wallets belonging to the major opposition during the previous signal vote did not participate this time around.","Â© 2023 The Block.
