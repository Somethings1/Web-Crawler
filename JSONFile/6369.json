Validators maximize the chance the canonical chain (the accepted chain that users interact with and post transaction blocks to) can be detected while also defending against potential attacks.","The reason why having multiple validators is important is because it makes it much more difficult and game-theoretically improbable for an attacker to coordinate an attack via miner (or staker) collusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Jump Crypto will propose significant upgrades to Solana\u2019s open-source core software along with building a second and new open-source validator client using the C++ programming language, separate from the one built by Solana Labs. The process will be overseen by Jump Crypto\u2019s chief science officer, Kevin Bowers.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
