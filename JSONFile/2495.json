Proposal asks if Curve should protect its IP","category":["DEFI"],"content":["A <a href=\"https:\/\/gov.curve.fi\/t\/cip-xx-enforce-curves-ip-rights\/1890\/3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">new proposal<\/a> on the Curve governance forum asks whether the decentralized finance (DeFi) project should try to enforce its intellectual property in court.","Not only does the proposal consider whether the IP should be enforced more broadly, but it considers a specific example of Saddle Finance, which the proposer claims has been accused of copying Curve\u2019s code.","\u201CI propose Curve engage competent counsel both in the USA and (to the extent Saddle or other infringers or their VC\u2019s have identifiable assets abroad) other relevant jurisdictions,\u201D the proposal states.&nbsp;","Curve is a decentralized exchange running on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform is managed by a core team but it has a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that is able to propose and vote for ways it should be changed, using Curve\u2019s governance token CRV.","The key questions are whether Curve <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">can<\/i> enforce its IP \u2014 since the organization itself is largely decentralized \u2014 and also whether it should, something that would be new to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/the-logbook-licensing-in-defi-58449\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">largely open-source<\/a> and unregulated DeFi industry.","As noted in the proposal, Curve\u2019s code has a license that states, \u201Cno license, right of reproduction or distribution or other right with respect thereto is granted or implied.\u201D","In January, some members of the Curve community alleged that Saddle Finance\u2019s code was based on Curve\u2019s. According to an audit by Quantstamp, Saddle Finance\u2019s implementation of StableSwap was ported from Curve Finance\u2019s contracts. And when asked the difference between Curve and Saddle, the official Curve Twitter account <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CurveFinance\/status\/1351564385957924864\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>, \u201CFor now, seems like exactly the same math but with VCs. Will see how it plays out.\u201D","The proposal argues that Curve\u2019s governance forum should review proposals from law firms and put them to a vote. And if a lawsuit results in a proposal of a settlement, that would also go to a vote.","\u201CThis will also set an important precedent in DAO\u2019s and DeFi that decentralization does not mean that VC\u2019s get to steal from communities,\u201D the proposal states.","The comments section shows a mixed reaction to the proposal.&nbsp;","Curve team member Julien Bouteloup argues that it\u2019s a \u201Cvery good proposal\u201D that may have the result of disincentivizing other projects to impede on Curve\u2019s IP.","Others were concerned, however, that this might bring regulatory scrutiny to the project and its token.&nbsp;","\u201CIt all makes a lot of sense, just afraid this would make CRV and veCRV a security and bring a lot of pain to everyone, more than non enforcing IP rights,\u201D writes Daniele Sesta, a self-proclaimed \u201CChief Rug Puller\u201D at Popsicle Finance.","An anonymous user writes that it could raise questions in court about Curve\u2019s lack of a money transmitting license, while reiterating concerns over the tokens being deemed unregistered securities.","Â© 2023 The Block.
