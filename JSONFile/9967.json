Hence, they would be subject to \"more stringent requirements\" regarding capital, investor rights, and supervision. The proposal is in line with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/77858\/european-commission-draft-proposal-on-crypto-assets-has-stablecoins-in-its-crosshairs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">leaked version<\/a> from last week.","The commission has today proposed a \"bespoke\" regime for crypto-assets and stablecoins. \"The bespoke regime for crypto-assets will ensure a high level of consumer and investor protection and market integrity, by regulating the main activities related to crypto-assets,\" said the commission. The main activities include such as crypto exchange and wallet services.","\"By imposing requirements (such as governance, operational requirements) on the main crypto-asset service providers and issuers operating in the EU, the proposal is likely to reduce the amounts of fraud and theft of crypto-assets,\" said the commission, adding:","\"The bespoke regime will introduce specific requirements on e-money tokens, significant e-money tokens, asset-referenced tokens and significant asset-referenced tokens in order to address the potential risks to financial stability and monetary policy transmission these can present. Finally, it will address market fragmentation issues arising from the different national approaches across the EU.\"","The commission has today also proposed a regulatory sandbox to allow companies to test blockchain technology in trade and settlement processes.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe proposals are part of the commission's newly adopted Digital Finance Package. The package will \"boost Europe's competitiveness and innovation in the financial sector, paving the way for Europe to become a global standard-setter,\" said the commission. \"It will give consumers more choice and opportunities in financial services and modern payments, while at the same time ensuring consumer protection and financial stability.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
