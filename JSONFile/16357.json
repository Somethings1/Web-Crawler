Just this year, the asset has jumped a staggering 62-fold.","The LUNA token from Terra, another smart-contract blockchain, also nearly tripled in price in August, pushing its market capitalization to about $13 billion.","Among the CoinDesk 20, a curated roster of digital assets, the top performer was Cardano\u2019s ADA token, which doubled in price during the month, followed by Polkadot\u2019s DOT with a 75% return.","All of these top performers in August were members of a group dubbed \u201CEthereum killers\u201D \u2013 so-called layer 1 blockchains offering low fees, enhanced scalability and fast transaction times designed to support applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) as well as trading in non-fungible tokens (NFT).","The intense speculation comes as Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain overall after Bitcoin, prepares to undergo a major upgrade over the coming year known as Ethereum 2.0.","\u201CWe have enormous respect for the Ethereum developer community\u2019s spirit,\u201D Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko, told CoinDesk. \u201CIt\u2019s been an inspiration to watch, and in many ways laid the blueprint for disintermediating all of the world\u2019s marketplaces, starting with DeFi. We are in the same fight.\u201D","Solana also launched its global five-week Ignition Hackathon on Aug. 31, which will focus on Web 3.0 development, DeFi, gaming and NFTs. While some traders and commenters on Twitter had speculated that the Ignition event implied that a token-burning announcement was imminent, a spokesperson for Solana said the rumor was false.","Solana, backed by investors including Andresseen Horowitz (a16z) and Polychain Capital, was founded in 2017 by Yakovenko and has garnered interest from investors because of its perceived scalability, low transaction costs and fast processing speed.","Ethereum is home to the most active development community among smart-contract blockchains and DeFi activity, as well as the fast-growing OpenSea NFT marketplace. But the network has struggled with congestion and high fees.","\u201CETH has experienced growing transaction fees amid the NFT frenzy, possibly attracting more users to other chains,\u201D according to a report by Arcane Research. \u201CHowever, in the DeFi ecosystem overall, Ethereum remains the clear leader, and it seems unlikely that any other protocol will dethrone Ethereum\u2019s position in the near future.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"$108","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Yakovenko","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cardano\u2019s ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"75%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Arcane Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$33.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Messari","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aug. 31","content":"DATE"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Polychain Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"195%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Terra","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Andresseen Horowitz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Anatoly Yakovenko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$13 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Markets","Cryptocurrency Markets","Solana","Cardano","Terra","Polkadot"],"authors":["Tracy Wang"]}
