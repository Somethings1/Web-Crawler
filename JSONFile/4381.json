The goal is to grow the amount of solana locked on the Marinade platform by 40 million SOL, the team <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MarinadeFinance\/status\/1617944711154794496\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> on Twitter.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Liquid staking allows users to receive a token that represents their staked assets. These tokens, in this case mSOL, can then be used in other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or for trading, but must be returned to unlock the original staked assets. This approach to staking allows users to free up liquidity and generate extra yield on assets that are being staked.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, less than 3% of all SOL is used for liquid staking, according to Marinade's <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MarinadeFinance\/status\/1617944715403603975\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">estimates<\/a>. However, as more users make use of liquid staking, this is expected to change. The team behind Marinade believes that a growth in liquid staking will have a significant impact to boost liquidity across various protocols in the Solana ecosystem.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
