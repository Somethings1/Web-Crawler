When asked why he left Coinbase, Cortright said in an interview that he wasn\u2019t growing much as an engineer and wanted to build a platform for human-readable blockchain data to help bring the next billion users in crypto.","Coherent is working on APIs that will allow developers to build applications and offer new features using its data. The firm is focusing on three types of data \u2014 on-chain transaction history, non-fungible token (NFT) data and credentials \u2014 according to Cortright.","\u201CWe will be like Plaid for crypto. Like how Plaid allows you to connect a bank account and then get all the transactions from that bank account to their API. We will allow you to connect to a wallet address and get all of the information about that address easily in a very digestible way,\u201D said Cortright.","Coherent is not the only startup building APIs for blockchain data. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/99202\/blockchain-data-provider-covalent-2-million-decentralize-platform\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Covalent<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/146260\/web3-development-platform-moralis-reels-in-40-million-in-series-a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moralis<\/a> are two of its closest competitors, but Coherent has a specific focus on user data, said Cortright.","\"A lot of similar startups are going really broad, like they're trying to build APIs for everything. We are very much narrowed down on identity and user data,\" said Cortright.","Coherent\u2019s product is currently in a testing phase and is expected to launch in September.","There are currently five people working for Coherent and Cortright plans to hire two more engineers in the near future.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updates to include Coherent's other co-founder Ellen Choi&nbsp;<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
