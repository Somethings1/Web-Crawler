The company aims to be an infrastructure partner in developing \"resilient\" cities.","\"Paolo will begin his tenure by focusing on technological advancements, supporting peer-to-peer projects, and participating in bitcoin mining initiatives,\" the spokesperson said. \"This broader technological and industry advancement strategy may also include collaboration with regulators to establish clearer guidelines and foster greater compliance within the cryptocurrency space.\"","Tether has been venturing into new business lines over the past year.","In June 2022, Tether's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/159423\/bitfinex-tether-video-calling-app-keet-holepunch-hypercore?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Holepunch<\/a> launched a peer-to-peer encrypted video-calling app called Keet.
