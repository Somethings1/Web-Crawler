For instance, MakerDAO lets users<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> deposit cryptocurrency-denominated collateral to take out loans denominated in U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, called DAI.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But participation in DeFi today is limited because it requires that users have purely crypto-native assets, says Vogelsang. \u201CHow do we pull new users into this? One way to do that is to allow them to use the assets they already have,\u201D he says.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To that end, today Centrifuge is rolling out an Ethereum Dapp called Tinlake, which lets users turn real-world assets into securities against which interest-bearing ERC20 tokens can be issued. These tokens can be used to gain further access to DeFi services.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Imagine you hold assets, like car loans, trade invoices, or music streaming royalties \u2014 legal documents that entitle you to cash at some point. As an \u201Casset originator,\u201D you can use Tinlake to turn these assets into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with all of the necessary legal documentation attached, create an asset pool (called \u201Csecuritization\u201D in traditional finance), and then issue <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/centrifuge\/a-tale-of-two-tokens-introducing-tin-drop-our-two-investment-tokens-d4c7342c799a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">two kinds of ERC20 tokens<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, explains Vogelsang. Centrifuge calls them Tin tokens and Drop tokens.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vogelsang says the process is akin to issuing a \u201Cjunior tranche\u201D and a \u201Csenior tranche\u201D of securities \u2014 a common approach in traditional finance. The junior tranche (Tin) is riskier \u2014 if losses occur, holders of this token are first in line to cover them \u2014 but can pay a higher return. The senior tranch (Drop) is more stable and less risky.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Asset originators will hold some amount Tin tokens themselves \u2014 to have some \u201Cskin in the game,\u201D says Vogelsang. Other Tin investors will probably be sophisticated traders who understand the particular real-world asset class well and want to have leveraged exposure, he says.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Drop tokens, meanwhile, are meant for further use in the DeFi world.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For example, Centrifuge is teaming with trade finance startup <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.consolfreight.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ConsolFreight<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to tokenize <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/tinlake.centrifuge.io\/0xf8b4ef7781ba8e1b3df6370f71d526d00aad1ee2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">freight shipping invoices<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In a similar project, Centrifuge has teamed with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/paperchain.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Paperchain<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, a startup that helps its customers access their music streaming royalties early, to tokenize such royalties.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In each case, the project\u2019s leaders have also entered <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposals<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to the MakerDAO community to accept their Drop tokens as collateral for stablecoin loans. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This would make it possible for businesses to use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/forum.makerdao.com\/t\/cf-drop-mip6-application-consolfreight-drop-tokenized-freight-shipping-invoices\/2214\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tokenized freight invoices<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/forum.makerdao.com\/t\/pc-drop-mip6-application-paperchain-drop-tokenized-music-streaming-invoices\/2215\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">music streaming royalties<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> as collateral for cash loans, a practice that in traditional finance is called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/i\/invoice-financing.asp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">invoice factoring<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vogelsang and three of his co-founders at Centrifuge previously worked at a company called Taulia, which built software that customers would use to give their suppliers various financing options on their invoices. He says that experience revealed opportunities to serve certain groups \u2014 for instance, businesses who hold trade invoices or music streaming royalty deals \u2014 that want to use this kind of financial service but that for whatever reason doesn\u2019t have access.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This opportunity won\u2019t be open to just anyone, though. ConsolFreight and Paperchain, for instance, are based in the U.S. and thus subject to U.S. securities law. That means if you are a U.S. person, you have to be an accredited investor or you will be locked out.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That\u2019s the flip side of bringing real-world assets on-chain, says Vogelsang: \u201CThese assets are only worth something if you have a legal claim against the underlying collateral.\u201D To achieve this, Centrifuge has set it up so that each asset pool is associated with a legal entity, called a special purpose vehicle (SPV), that acts as the issuer of the Tin and Drop tokens. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe\u2019re working super hard on making this SPV as powerless as possible, delegating as much as we can to the smart contract,\u201D he says.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Some may still see that as a single point of failure, but Vogelsang sees it as a necessary tradeoff. \u201CDeFi really needs new assets to be able to grow more,\u201D he says. \u201CReal-world assets, I think, must be this opportunity.\u201D<\/span>"],"hashtag":[]}
