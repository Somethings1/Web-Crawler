The new grant&nbsp;brought the foundation\u2019s total commitment to Nimbus to $1.65 million.","Since the start of testing, developers have found a number of bugs in the system and are working to address them, Ratsimbazafy told The Block. To uncover additional deficiencies, he said, the team needs to implement fuzzing, a testing technique that sends random inputs into the network to trigger corner cases.","Moreover, while testing has been mostly focused on Eth2 specifications up to this point, a fully-featured client needs to make sure that other elements \u2013 peer discovery and handling, monitoring, performance, automation, etc. \u2013 are robust as well.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Right now, Nimbus' eth2 client is running the latest specification of the Beacon Chain in preparation for integration with other clients in the near future, Ratsimbazafy said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe team\u2019s priorities for 2020 are to deliver and participate in a multiclient testnet with both desktop and mobile nodes, to audit and secure the client, to start implementing phase 1 and phase 2 of Ethereum 2,\u201D he said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mobile-first client<\/strong>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nimbus is a mobile-first project. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Ratsimbazafy, the team hopes to ensure that Eth2 is built with mobile constraints from the ground up since a huge part of the world is accessing the Web through mobile devices rather than desktop computers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf we want to reach those communities, blockchain needs to be mobile,\u201D he said. \u201CThis is even more important as often there is distrust in the centralized services and actors in those parts of the world.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While running the client in a mobile environment offers improved accessibility, it brings additional challenges regarding data consumption, battery drain, and dealing with ephemeral presence.
