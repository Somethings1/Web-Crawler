The firm recently launched a beta version of its exchange processing gateway to enable large crypto exchanges to process credit and debit cards for a reduced fee, Carbon CEO Sam Trautwein told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Right now, the firm mainly works with clients within the E.U. With its Wyre partnership, however, Carbon will gain access to Wyre\u2019s core infrastructure and start bringing its product to U.S. users.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Trautwein, users expect more options when it comes to crypto payment, and developers should make sure that their applications support as many assets, countries, and rails as possible.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CHistorically, most of the money in crypto is moved by money wire, but most consumers globally have never sent a money wire,\u201D he said. \u201CIn terms of building an API and a widget that supports a variety of rails and jurisdictions, there aren\u2019t many groups with a robust offering.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Trautwein sees its partnership with Wyre as a stepping stone towards massively reducing the amount of friction and cost for blockchain developers to onboard users. Specifically, he believes that for the sector to keep growing, fees have to come down.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf you look at the cost for buying crypto via credit cards, it shouldn\u2019t be anywhere close to 10%,\u201D he said. \u201COur credit card processing fees are 3% and we guarantee that our price will be within 3% of spot.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But Carbon does not plan on limiting its future businesses to the crypto market.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In Oct. 2019, the startup was accepted as a member of Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 batch and is now building new products alongside non-crypto payment firms like Stripe and Brex. According to Trautwein, Carbon\u2019s next product will leverage the team\u2019s experience and tech stack to target a market outside of crypto.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI don\u2019t think that the company that dominates crypto payments will only be doing crypto in five years,\u201D he said. \u201CWe have a lot of respect for Y Combinator\u2019s role in helping build companies like Stripe, Brex, and Plaid. We could benefit from having people around us who have helped scale very large payment companies.\u201D<\/span>","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
