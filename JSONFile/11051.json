It also expressed concerns about the sentiment in the section saying that ether was not a security. It said that if Hinman wanted to make a blanket statement that ether is not a security, this would need further internal discussion.","In December 2020, the SEC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/89560\/ripple-response-sec-lawsuit-xrp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">initiated<\/a> a high-profile lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alleging that the company raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered digital asset securities offering with its cryptocurrency, XRP. William Hinman later emerged as a key figure in this lawsuit. The documents were released per the order of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.","This statement had been frequently cited by Ripple Labs throughout the ongoing legal proceedings. Ripple argued that Hinman\u2019s remarks, particularly regarding the status of ETH, contradict the SEC\u2019s claim that XRP is a security.","Ripple has been seeking these documents since late 2021. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple\u2019s CEO and a key defendant in the case, said \u2014 ahead of the release of the documents \u2014 that the wait would be worth it.","\"Wish I could go in depth now, but we\u2019ve waited this long (18+ months), I don\u2019t want to overstep\u2026 suffice it to say,\u2019 Brad Garlinghouse <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bgarlinghouse\/status\/1668361426187218945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> in response to a post by crypto YouTuber Jungle Inc. \"Stuart Alderoty [chief legal officer at Ripple] and I believe the documents were well worth the wait,\" he added.","The public release of the Hinman documents may ignite a significant debate about the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities, especially during these challenging times for the industry. Recently, the SEC filed lawsuits against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance, accusing them of selling unregistered securities. In the legal complaint against Coinbase, the SEC listed at least 13 crypto assets that the agency claimed Coinbase made available to customers, including solana (SOL) and cardano (ADA).","Today will be a momentous day for legal issues in the crypto space, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/iampaulgrewal\/status\/1668431316453343239?s=46&amp;t=oHf46otX4Di1EPF3Xc_kDA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to Paul Grewal<\/a>, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer. Besides the release of the Hinman documents, there are two other significant developments: a federal court hearing on the SEC\u2019s motion to seize Binance\u2019s assets in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and the SEC\u2019s expected response to a rulemaking petition from Coinbase. Submitted in April, the petition argues that the current regulations are ill-suited for the crypto sector. The response is anticipated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
