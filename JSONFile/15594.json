As a \u201Cblockchain optimized for high throughput, de minimis costs and native scalability,\u201D it represents a \u201Clegitimately differentiated approach within the layer 1 landscape,\u201D he added.","Coinbase says given the ecosystem\u2019s relative strength in terms of network activity with regards to transactions, users and development, Solana is well positioned to reassert itself as a genuine layer 1 competitor. A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure, of a blockchain.","Activity on Solana compares favorably to that on Ethereum at present, suggesting the solana (SOL) token may be undervalued relative to ether (ETH), the note said.","Furthermore, solana\u2019s market capitalization is only about 4.3% of ether\u2019s, while the amount of daily active users on the blockchain represents around 43.7% of Ethereum\u2019s daily active user base. It also processes around 17 times the amount of daily transactions processed by Ethereum, the note added.","Read more: Citi Says Solana Blockchain Activity Remains High"],"entity":[{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"43.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"4.3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Anatoly Yakovenko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brian Cubellis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Citi Says Solana Blockchain Activity Remains High","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Solana","Blockchains","layer 1"],"authors":["Will Canny"]}
