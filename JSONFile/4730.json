Mike Flood, R-Neb., Tom Emmer, R-Minn., Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y. and Wiley Nickel, D-N.C., urged Gensler to allow those listings, arguing a regulated spot bitcoin ETF would increase investor protection by making access to bitcoin more transparent and safer, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/flood.house.gov\/sites\/evo-subsites\/flood.house.gov\/files\/evo-media-document\/sec-bitcoin-spot-etf-letter-signature-check.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter<\/span><\/a> sent Tuesday.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Congress has a duty to ensure the SEC approves investment products that meet the requirements set out by Congress,\" they said. \"To that end, we urge you to approve the listing of spot-bitcoin ETPs immediately.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Last month, Grayscale Investments <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247947\/bitcoin-price-soars-after-grayscale-win-in-dispute-with-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">secured a win<\/a> when three judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the SEC had to re-review its bid for a spot bitcoin ETF. This came after Grayscale sued the agency last year after its proposal for spot bitcoin ETF was rejected.<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The court specifically addressed the SEC's differential treatment of spot bitcoin ETFs and similar funds based on futures contracts, which the regulator has approved.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The Court\u2019s finding underscores the fundamental point,\" the lawmakers said. \"A spot bitcoin ETP is indistinguishable from a bitcoin futures ETP. Thus, the SEC\u2019s current posture is untenable moving forward.\"<\/span>","Gensler will respond to members of Congress directly, not through the media, an SEC spokesperson said.&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC has not yet greenlit a spot bitcoin ETF, although big name players including BlackRock and Fidelity have submitted applications for funds over the past several months.&nbsp;<\/span>","Separately on Tuesday, Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., sent a letter to Gensler and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority President Robert Cook over concerns that both agencies allow registered broker-dealers with ownership ties to the Chinese Community Party to operate in the U.S.&nbsp;","Luetkemeyer argued guidance was too narrow and insufficient to address concerns regarding non-China based U.S. firms with ties to the CCP, citing broker-dealers, including Prometheum Inc, Webull Financial, LLC and Moomoo, Inc.&nbsp;","\"The SEC's limited effort in this regard is particularly troubling given the important role registered broker-dealers play in our financial markets, including the fact that many of these firms provide (or intend to provide) products and services directly to retail investors, which requires the collection of substantial amounts of customers' personal information,\" the lawmaker said.&nbsp;","Luetkemeyer posed questions asking Gensler about the agency's data security concerns on ties to the CCP, among others. The deadline for Cook and Gensler to respond is Oct. 26.&nbsp;","The SEC, Moomoo and Webull did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;","FINRA said it planned to respond to the letter. Prometheum declined to comment on this specific letter.
