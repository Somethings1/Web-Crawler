The legal framework also recognizes the internal governance processes of these organizations, including voting on proposals and tokenization.","As part of the newly passed law, the government has also created a registry process for these crypto communities. The Marshall Islands DAO, or MIDAO, will helm this registry, according to the announcement. MIDAO will be responsible for onboarding crypto and blockchain communities that wish to register as LLCs in the island nation.","The DAO law is an extension of the island nation\u2019s experience in international business registration and compliance, Finance Minister Brensen Wase stated in the release.","\u201CWith this adoption of the DAO Act of 2022, The Marshall Islands commits its courts and its resources to the burgeoning world of decentralization, and recognizes the unique place that decentralized autonomous organizations can hold not just in the blockchain space, but in the broader economy as well,\u201D said Wase.","Â© 2023 The Block.
