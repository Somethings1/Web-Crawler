However, since Convex Finance contracts are immutable and non-upgradeable, a new contract had to be deployed. The new vlCVX contract has implemented a fix for this potential bug going forward,\u201D the team wrote in a blog post.","It\u2019s the latest example of the perilously experimental nature of decentralized finance (DeFi), a $200 billion industry where supply shocks, smart contract bugs and volatile prices are often the norm.","Convex\u2019s vote locking mechanism is key to the project\u2019s token economy, one that allows for users to collect \u201Cbribes\u201D from protocols and direct liquidity deposits into another protocol, Curve Finance, but only if users lock their tokens for 16 weeks.","This mechanism plays a key part in the complex, multilayered battle to control voting power in another protocol\u2019s token, Curve Finance\u2019s CRV, colloquially known as the \u201CCurve Wars.\u201D","Read more: CRV Extends Rally as \u2018Curve Wars\u2019 Intensify","The vote locking mechanism also plays a key role in managing CVX\u2019s circulating supply, with over 72% of the supply locked earlier on Friday. Frequent CVX traders often track major unlock dates, as they can lead to supply and price fluctuations.","As such, the sudden, unexpected unlock of millions of tokens has led to a significant supply shock on Friday.","Prices fell as much as 20% from $19.10 to $15.22 in a matter of hours.","However, large holders have stepped in to add to their positions, and many users have opted to re-lock their tokens rather than take the opportunity to sell, even during a time of macroeconomic uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine.","While volatile, prices have been rebounding throughout the afternoon, as CVX currently sits at $16.55, down 15% on the day."],"entity":[{"type":"CVX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$200 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"72%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Convex Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CRV Extends Rally as \u2018Curve Wars\u2019 Intensify","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Curve Finance\u2019s CRV","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$15.22","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$16.55","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$19.10","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"afternoon","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Ukraine","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["DeFi","Convex Finance","Bugs","smart contracts"],"authors":["Andrew Thurman"]}
