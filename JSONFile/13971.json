It has now moved $72 million worth of value across both blockchains via the Ren BTC Gateway, a crypto bridge used to move transfer tokens from one network to another.","The main FTX drainer wallet held 250,000 ether ($302 million at the time) on Saturday after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/188565\/ftx-drainer-consolidates-ether-holdings-to-reach-302-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">consolidating<\/a> ether holdings from other wallets.

This process usually involved sending a batch of ether to a new wallet before swapping for bitcoin, which was done by trading ether for renBTC, a tokenized version of bitcoin issued by Ren. After the swap, the hacker bridges the renBTC to the Bitcoin blockchain using Ren\u2019s crypto bridge service.","The individual or entity in question swapped 20,000 ETH ($22.4 million) for 1,023 renBTC ($16.3 million) on Monday.
