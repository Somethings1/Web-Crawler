The team also includes Arnaud Droz as Chief Operating Officer and Cameron McIntosh as Chief Marketing Officer.","Within the next 18 months or so, Bubblemaps hopes to add three main features to the platform. The first is to follow token distribution all the way back to when it was first created and held in a single wallet before dispersing, which Vaimon called \"Code Name: Big Bang.\"","Second, to give users the ability to create any Bubblemap of wallets they choose, creating visual representations of curated wallets as opposed to spreadsheets. \"Bubble Labs,\" as the feature is called, will be aimed at supporting on-chain sleuths, marketing agencies and others who want to draw specific conclusions from certain wallets.&nbsp;","The third would be to integrate AI that can explain the meaning behind certain wallet clusters on Bubblemaps, designed to help crypto beginners understand the on-chain transactions.&nbsp;","The firm likely will not fundraise again until completing these milestones.","\"We really want to focus on actually achieving this inner road map that we have, this way of spending what we've raised, and then look into, of course, raising again,\" McIntosh told The Block in an interview.","\"It's all well and good receiving funds, but we want to do it accordingly,\" he added. \"We want to make sure we're building the product people want.\"&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["SEED &AMP; PRE-SEED"]}
