Zuckerberg notably spoke less about the metaverse \u2014 Meta's virtual reality gambit on which it has spent billions of dollars \u2014 and more about artificial intelligence.&nbsp;","Still, Zuckerberg sought to counter the idea that Meta is backing away from the metaverse in spite of a $4 billion Q1 loss in its metaverse division.&nbsp;","\"A narrative has developed that we're somehow moving away from focusing on the metaverse vision.
