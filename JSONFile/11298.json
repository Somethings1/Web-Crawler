Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Rep. Peter Meijer (R-Mich.) in the House of Representatives.&nbsp;","In statements upon the bill's introduction, the three congressmen cited inflation and \"fiscal uncertainty\" as motivation for expanding retirement investment options. They also note that far more Americans rely on 401(k)s than traditional pensions for their retirements, but criticize limits on 401(k) investments as reducing overall returns compared to those traditional pensions.","<span lang=\"en-US\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COur legislation will provide the millions of American savers invested in defined contribution plans with the option to enhance their retirement savings through access to the same wide range of alternative assets currently available to savers with defined benefit pension plans,\" said Toomey in a release touting the bill.<\/span>","The bill is broader than digital assets, but Toomey in particular has established an image as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/164082\/senator-claims-the-fdic-is-stonewalling-banks-that-try-to-work-with-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">leading crypto advocate<\/a> on the Hill. But many in government \u2014 notably the Department of Labor, which regulates retirement plans \u2014 are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/144303\/labor-department-has-grave-concerns-over-fidelitys-401k-bitcoin-plans\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">skeptical to the inclusion of crypto<\/a> in retirement plans.&nbsp;","With midterms coming at the beginning of November, legislative action has largely stalled. Toomey is not running for re-election, and Meijer lost his primary election to Republican challenger John Gibbs, so he won't be returning to the next congressional session. However, the bill's authors may look to insert their bill into a broader end-of-year tax bill.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
