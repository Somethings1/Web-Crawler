While some of the whales have sold some holdings, they still hold over 176 trillion ladys coins, or around 20% of its total supply, per the onchain data.","The profits result from simple math. The whales paid a weighted average price of $0.0000000037604 per token, and the current price of the coin is around $0.00000012. That's a lot of zeros, but it adds up to a gain of 3,091%, according to CoinGecko data.","","","Realizing profits may not come easy for these whales, given the low liquidity. \u201CThere is about $3 million worth of liquidity, spread over Uniswap v2 and v3. If these whales want to close down their position, they should either take into account huge slippage, or they need to wind down the position slowly over time,\u201D said Simon Cousaert, director of data at The Block.","Memecoin trading volumes are soaring, led by ladys and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230279\/elon-musk-milady-price-twitter-meme\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pepe<\/a>.
