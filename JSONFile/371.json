At Binance, Tam lead the exchange's VIP coverage and over-the-counter trading operations.&nbsp;In his new position, Tam will have a broad mandate, leading the expansion of the firm into new territories as well as new products.&nbsp;","Tam has 15 years of experience in the financial services space, having previously led Bank of Merrill Lynch Hong Kong's institutional client group.&nbsp;","Launched in early 2019, CoinFLEX markets itself as the first physically-delivered cryptocurrency futures exchange and commands 8.6% of the marketshare for BTC futures, according to data compiled by The Block. By comparison, Binance owns 9.9% of the BTC futures market.&nbsp;","&nbsp;","","","Chief executive Mark Lamb told The Block that CoinFLEX will expand its cryptocurrency trading-based competitions, such as its so-called Bracket Order Battle. The competition, according to CoinFLEX's website, offers a way for traders to win cash prizes by placing trades with the new order type.","Lamb said the last competition brought in $80 million in volume during a 2-hour period. In 2020, the firm is looking to conduct competitions every week.&nbsp;","CoinFLEX's bid to dangle financial carrots to its traders represents a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market: gamified trading experiences. Rival ByBit recently announced the launch of its BTC Brawl competition, which offers participants a pool of more than 100 bitcoin in prizes. CoinFLEX earlier this year announced a market maker incentive program that would offer qualified traders a rebate if CoinFLEX volumes topped OKEx across all products or if its bitcoin contract topped BitMEX's similar perpetual swap.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["BINANCE","DERIVATIVES"]}
