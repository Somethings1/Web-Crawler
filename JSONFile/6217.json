It will utilize Neo\u2019s native GAS token for both governance and utility functions.","The team claims the objective behind the sidechain is to provide an MEV-resistant platform for EVM compatible dapps.","Founded in 2014 and initially known as AntShares, Neo is one of the oldest smart contract platforms originally based out of China. The Neo mainnet has been running in stable capacity since Oct. 2016.","The Neo virtual machine (Neo-VM), the network\u2019s computing framework, provides a multi-language development environment to give developers the ability to write smart contracts in their preferred languages.","Utilizing sidechains, which are parallel blockchains, is emerging as a prevalent approach to integrate Ethereum-based smart contracts with blockchains that lack native support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.","Apart from Neo, developers on blockchain networks such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177686\/the-xrp-ledger-tests-first-sidechain-compatible-with-ethereum-apps\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">XRP Ledger<\/a>, Horizen, and <a href=\"https:\/\/iohk.io\/en\/blog\/posts\/2022\/07\/06\/introducing-the-cardano-evm-sidechain\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cardano<\/a> are in various stages of developing or have already implemented EVM-compatible sidechains to accommodate Ethereum dapps.","Â© 2023 The Block.
