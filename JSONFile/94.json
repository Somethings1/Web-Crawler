However, they continue to earn additional transaction fee rewards for each block mined as usual.","There have been three halving events in Bitcoin's history, reducing its block subsidy inflation from 50 BTC to 25 BTC in 2012, then to 12.5 BTC in 2016, and 6.25 BTC at the last halving on May 11, 2020. In the long term, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence.","The halving events will continue until the last bitcoin is expected to be mined around the year 2140. After this, miners will only earn from transaction fees.","Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been associated with significant fluctuations in the cryptocurrency's price.
