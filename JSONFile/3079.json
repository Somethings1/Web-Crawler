We will finally offer end users a one-stop portal to navigate the Internet of Blockchains. Our beta \u2014 launching this month \u2014 starts fulfilling this vision, with a focus on cross-chain DeFi,\u201D said Tendermint CEO Peng Zhong.","Tendermint is a core contributor to the Cosmos network, a set of multiple interconnecting blockchains. It provides blockchain software as well as development kits, both used by blockchain projects in the Cosmos ecosystem.","The beta launch of Emeris will begin as a non-custodial dashboard \u2014 meaning that users maintain control over their own funds \u2014 for dapps in the Cosmos ecosystem. It will start with a core focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.","When the beta goes live, it will have support for the Gravity DEX protocol, a decentralized exchange for trading tokens across blockchains. It will start by supporting several Cosmos blockchains, such as Cosmos Hub, Crypto.com and Akash Network.","But the plan is for Emeris to go beyond the Cosmos ecosystem. The goal will be for it to support multiple other blockchains, beginning with Ethereum.","\u201CUltimately, Emeris will give access to the best crypto apps, no matter what blockchain they run on,\u201D said Zhong.","It will also grow beyond the dashboard. Tendermint hopes to build a mobile application and a browser extension wallet to provide wider access.","Tendermint isn\u2019t the only company planning to provide a unified access point to the crypto ecosystem. Crypto exchange Coinbase, which recently revealed that it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/109889\/coinbase-ceo-we-plan-to-list-every-crypto-asset-where-legally-viable\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wants to add all cryptocurrencies<\/a> where legally viable to its exchange, also plans to build a crypto app store.","Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in a blog post that the exchange wants to build \u201Cthe\u201D crypto app store, citing Apple\u2019s success in doing so for centralized apps.&nbsp;","\u201CThere is now 10s of billions of dollars of economic activity running on [dapps], and a new trend coming out every three months. We\u2019ll work to give our users easy access to all of this from the main Coinbase product,\u201D he said.","Coinbase already offers access to dapps through Coinbase Wallet, its non-custodial wallet app. This has an in-app web browser that shows a range of dapps on a Coinbase website. Users who click on these dapps are taken to the respective websites to access them directly.","The difference between that and a crypto app store is that the dapps would be natively built within the store, providing for a much more seamless experience.","Â© 2023 The Block.
