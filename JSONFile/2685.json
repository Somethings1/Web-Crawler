ApeCoin owners think otherwise","category":["GAMING AND METAVERSE"],"content":["The Bored Ape community has voted to keep building within the Ethereum ecosystem, rather than move the ApeCoin token its own blockchain as creator Yuga Labs had suggested.","According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/apecoin.eth\/proposal\/0x367eecaffc20976a4f913154eceb61279793b06ac0ad93ab948d2d3b207ff860\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">snapshot vote<\/a> that ended today, the ApeCoin governance mechanism \u2014 known as the ApeCoin DAO \u2014 voted 53.6% in favor of staying within the Ethereum ecosystem. The vote was close, with 3.8 million APE voting for the proposal and 3.3 million APE voting against it.","\u201CMigrating to a different chain is a costly, risky, and complex endeavor with many moving parts that may, if not thoughtfully considered, result in catastrophic loss, or at worst, abandonment by Yuga Labs,\u201D said the <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.apecoin.com\/t\/aip-41-keep-apecoin-within-the-ethereum-ecosystem-process\/5664\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal<\/a>.","Some large token holders that voted had a big impact. One investor who came out against the proposal did so with 1.2 million APE, representing 17% of the total vote. The top 13 voting holders controlled 56% of tokens in the poll.","The vote came about after Yuga Labs \u2014 creator of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) \u2014 kicked off discussion over the future of its native token ApeCoin, which is currently running on the Ethereum blockchain. After it sold parcels of land in its yet-to-be-built Otherside metaverse for $317 million in April, it blamed the Ethereum network for not being able to cope with demand.&nbsp;","\u201CIt seems abundantly clear that ApeCoin will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale. We'd like to encourage the DAO to start thinking in this direction,\u201D Yuga Labs <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yugalabs\/status\/1520612362986078208\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> on Twitter at the time.","This led to a flurry of proposals from other blockchain projects that ApeCoin \u2014 and even the entire Otherside metaverse \u2014 should migrate to their ecosystems.&nbsp;","The first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/148591\/avalanche-proposes-to-apecoin-dao-about-creating-an-otherside-subnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal<\/a> was by Ava Labs, the team behind Avalanche. It said Otherside and ApeCoin should be launched on an Avalanche subnet, a type of blockchain running on the Avalanche network. This would let it use its own token for transaction fees as well as control its level of decentralization and security.","The second <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/149623\/immutable-proposes-the-otherside-metaverse-should-be-built-on-its-layer-2-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal<\/a> was by Immutable X, an Ethereum-based platform that\u2019s designed for creating and trading NFTs. It suggested that using its platform would provide for a faster and smoother experience, while remaining in the Ethereum ecosystem.","Neither of these proposals have gone to a vote as of yet. It\u2019s also worth noting that ApeCoin DAO only has direct control over ApeCoin itself, while Yuga Labs remains in control of its other projects like Otherside \u2014 alongside partners like Animoca Brands. While the DAO may be able to influence Yuga Labs\u2019 decision-making process, it isn\u2019t able to force its hand.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
