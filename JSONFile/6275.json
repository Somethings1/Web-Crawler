Earlier in the week we notified users in Ontario that they did not need to close their accounts by December 31, 2021 following discussions with the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada and the Alberta Securities Commission regarding registration across Canada. However, we did not meet directly with the Ontario Securities Commission about our intentions, which was clearly an error that we are correcting.
