Estimates by The Block Research suggest Grayscale has brought in more than $109 million year-to-date.&nbsp;","In addition to new hires, the firm has a plan for upgrading its GBTC product to an exchange-traded fund should the regulators ultimately approve such a product.&nbsp;","\"We spent the better part of 2017 in SEC registration for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust,\" Sonnenshein told The Block. \"And we made a lot of progress with the commission and ultimately realized the regulatory environment wasn't ready for a bitcoin ETF and we pulled out of that process.\"","He added:","\"But we hope in the future, like we were planning to in 2017, to register and uplift GBTC onto a national securities exchange as a bonafide ETF.\"","Still, competition is mounting, with BlockFi and Osprey recently rolling out new funds. There's also Bitwise, which has seen its assets under management climb towards $1 billion in recent months.&nbsp;","In this episode of The Scoop, Sonnenshein breaks down its hiring goals for 2021 as well as the following:","© 2023 The Block.
