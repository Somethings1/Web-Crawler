Microsoft and Deloitte were said to be participating at the time of launch.","According to Bloomberg, this recent test is one of the most extensive experiments of its kind. Simulated assets were used during the test, also according to the report.","\"Participants executed more than 350 simulated transactions on blockchain for tokenized assets, fund registry, digital cash, repo, securities lending and margin management,\" the report said. \"The goal is to explore potential benefits, including reducing counterparty and settlement risks and optimizing capital.\"","The report suggested that the test demonstrates \"growing momentum\" among traditional financial institutions to use cases for blockchain technology \"after a decade\" of experimentation.","Traditional financial firms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281965\/blackrock-ibit-spot-bitcoin-etf-200000-btc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlackRock<\/a> and Fidelity launching spot bitcoin ETFs in January have also been viewed by many as legitimizing not just blockchain, but cryptocurrencies.
