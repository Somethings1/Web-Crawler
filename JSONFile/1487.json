The app officially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abra.com\/blog\/stock-and-etf-investing\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">went live<\/a> in May.","The app allows users to invest in stocks such as Tesla, Uber, Alibaba and Facebook, as well as ETFs like the gold SPDR with bitcoin. Tuesday\u2019s report showed that Tesla stock is the number one choice of investors followed by Amazon, Apple and Google.","The median investment amount in Tesla is also 191% higher at $71.64 as compared to the overall median investment on Abra at $24.65, per the report. The minimum investment amount via the app is $5.&nbsp;","\u201CWe think this is a reflection of the new millennial investor that puts their money where their beliefs are. And it\u2019s clear they believe in the vision that Elon Musk is building,\u201D Abra CEO, Bill Barhydt, told The Block.","South Africa (Musk\u2019s home country), France, Argentina, Austria and the Philippines are the top five nations going big on Tesla, according to the report.","It is important to note that the equity investing feature in Abra app is currently not available in the U.S.&nbsp; Abra wanted to roll it out in the country, but was held up due to regulations. Many market observers said at the time that Abra was offering the feature as the issuance of an equity derivative, which is a financial product and must be regulated with U.S. authorities.","Interestingly, Australia and Canada by contrast seem to be betting on gold as an investment, per the report. \u201CWe were surprised by some of the early trends too. We thought there may be a correlation with users in more distressed economies investing in gold but it\u2019s not playing out that way so far,\u201D Barhydt told The Block.","The preliminary results confirm that there is \u201Cindeed a market for decentralized finance, and that Bitcoin can deliver on the promise of global financial inclusion,\u201D Barhydt added.&nbsp;","He further said that the results are \u201Cso compelling\u201D that Abra will be publishing the report every quarter starting later this year.","Â© 2023 The Block.
