That work was powered by food.","About a million years ago, humans stumbled across fire. As a result, the energy available to us increased because now we could keep warm not just from what we ate but also from burning. So this added energy usage improved our standard of living.","Some thousands of years ago, our energy usage increased still further when we domesticated animals. Animals could labor in our place. Those new laborers also had to be fed. Large amounts of food were required to meet the energy demand, and our prosperity increased alongside.","In the last few hundred years, we built great machines. Those mechanized machines produced work, first from sources like water &amp; wind, and then the cheaper sources like coal and gas, and now from nuclear sources (fission\/fusion). Both machines and nature produce work through the utilization of energy. We have an economy based not on money, but on work and energy.","All things in our lives are closely linked to the price of energy. Purifying water requires energy. Transporting products requires energy. Manufacturing products requires energy. Cooking requires energy. Refrigerators and freezers require energy. In a free market, the cost of any good largely reflects the energy used in producing that good. Because free markets encourage the lowest priced goods, the energy used in producing any good is minimized. Money, which is the representation of the work required to generate goods and services, can also be viewed as stored energy.","&nbsp;","In the early 20th century, industry leaders like Henry Ford and Thomas Edison were interested in replacing gold or the dollar with \u201Cthe energy dollar\u201D or \u201Cunits of energy\u201D (commodity\/energy currency). The concept was popular due to its sound money characteristics, including: a well-defined unit of account, easy measurement\/not easily counterfeited, divisibility into smaller units, and fungibility (that these units would be equivalent to any other unit). However, energy money was flawed\u200A\u2014\u200Ait could not be transmitted or stored easily.","Fast forward to October 31, 2008\u200A\u2014\u200ASatoshi publishes the Bitcoin whitepaper.

Only later did Satoshi adapt it to be used in digital cash. What PoW mining does under the hood, is use dedicated machines (ASICs) to convert electricity into Bitcoins (via block reward).

The solution to the puzzle proves that the miner spent energy in the form of ASICs and electricity, a proof that a miner put in work.

As efficiency gains slow we can expect an increase in manufacturer competition as margins narrow.","All-in mining cost will shift from the upfront accessibility cost of ASIC hardware (capex) to the ongoing energy costs to operate (opex). Since the physical location of mining centers is not important to the Bitcoin network (they are movable), miners flock to areas generating surplus electricity for the lowest marginal costs. In the long-run, this has the potential to produce more efficient worldwide energy markets with Bitcoin miners performing an arbitrage of electricity between global centers. The cost of Bitcoin mining becomes the lowest (excess) value of electricity.

Nature is showing the way, powering the whole universe with nuclear fusion (stars). Humans are in the process of emulating nature by building fusion reactors. It is estimated that it will take ~$80B in research over decades to finally unlock nuclear fusion. The fuel for fusion (primarily deuterium) exists abundantly in the Earth\u2019s ocean which could potentially supply the world\u2019s energy needs for millions of years. Fusion power has many of the benefits of renewable energy sources, such as being a long-term energy supply and emitting no greenhouse gases or air pollution. Fusion could provide very high power-generation density and uninterrupted power delivery.
