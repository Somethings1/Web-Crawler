It also further decentralizes the cryptocurrency by removing the supply which was allocated to the Kin Foundation during the initial distribution. Now that the burn has been approved, the Kin Foundation can be closed and Kin will become truly decentralized \u2014 with no centralized entity (given an initial allocation) driving the value of the currency.\"","(<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updates with comment from Kin community member.<\/em>)","© 2023 The Block.
