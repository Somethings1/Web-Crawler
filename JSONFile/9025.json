Rather, the very object of each token was to facilitate activity on the underlying platforms and, in so doing, enable each network to develop and grow,\u201D the lawyers said. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC charged Ishan Wahi, the former Coinbase product manager, in July for insider trading. The agency alleges Ishan Wahi tipped off his friend and brother, Nikhil Wahi, about which tokens were going to be listed for trading on Coinbase \u2014 and in the process made over $1 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The lawyers say the digital assets in question were sold on the secondary market and add that there is not an investment in money \u2014 all pointing to those nine assets not being securities. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC uses the Howey Test, a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case, to help determine whether cryptocurrencies are securities. The ruling established that \u201C<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an investment contract exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others,\u201D SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The lawyers argue that the SEC\u2019s moves could have broader implications.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIn addition to holding Ishan and Nikhil Wahi liable for actions nobody could have anticipated would violate the securities laws \u2014 indeed, even Ishan\u2019s publicly traded employer was convinced these tokens were not securities \u2014 it would establish sweeping SEC jurisdiction over an industry without any input from Congress,\u201D the lawyers said. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC also did not \u201Cadequately allege scienter,\u201D the lawyers continued. Scienter is the intent or knowledge of wrongdoing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If the SEC shows the tokens satisfies the Howey definition, its complaint \u201Cfails to adequately allege scienter,\u201D the lawyers said. <\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CBecause the SEC cannot establish that the Wahis had the culpable state of mind necessary to commit securities fraud, the amended complaint must be dismissed,\u201D they said. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If the judge denies the motion to dismiss then the case would proceed, unless there is a settlement.&nbsp;<\/span>","The motion to dismiss was jointly filed by attorneys from Greenberg Traurig LLP, Harris St. Laurent &amp; Wechsler LLP, Jones Day, Chaudhry Law PLLC and Allen Hansen Maybrown &amp; Offenbecher in the U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington.","Â© 2023 The Block.
