According to current estimates, the halving is expected to take place on May 12.","Bitcoin's price has seen significant action since a sharp fall in mid-March, with the cryptocurrency appreciating ~33% since the day the S&amp;P500 bottomed on March 23, according to data from The Block Research.&nbsp;","","","\"Now it is true that bitcoin price was hit in the March risk-off, declining by 57% from US$9,184 to US$3,915 in the week to 13 March (see Exhibit 11),\" Wood noted of the sell-off. \"Still this does not necessarily mean to GREED &amp; fear that Bitcoin is just another high beta asset.\"","Wood went on to write:","\"In this respect, GREED &amp; fear continues to believe that investors should own both gold and Bitcoin in the sense that they are not mutually exclusive, though clearly attitudes to both vary according to the demographic profile of the investor.\"","Furthermore, Wood contended that bitcoin could add a degree of diversity to an investment portfolio.","\"It also should be a source of diversification in a portfolio, as is gold, precisely because of its truly decentralised nature,\" he said. \"It is this feature, combined with the fixed supply, which makes it a hedge against central bank manipulated fiat money.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
