This community vote also greenlit the use of the USDC and USDT stablecoins for deposit and withdrawal operations through an interoperability bridge with Ethereum.","From today, Vega Protocol will offer users the ability to create decentralized and permissionless markets. To start with, the network will only support cash-settled futures markets but it has plans to add spot, perpetual, and other types of markets in future stages.","Beyond its trading capabilities, the core team plans to introduce a browser wallet, allowing users direct in-browser access to the full Vega ecosystem. Additionally, the team plans to incorporate a software feature named Wendy, designed to provide Miner Extractable Value (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/224482\/ethereum-mev-bots-lose-over-25-million-in-sophisticated-attack\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MEV<\/a>) protection to on-chain traders.","After an extensive research and development phase spanning nearly five years, Vega launched on mainnet on May 10.
