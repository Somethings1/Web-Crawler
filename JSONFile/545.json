This comes months after the municipal government started its first giveaway campaign of 40 million digital yuan in February.&nbsp;","But instead of issuing free digital yuan to lucky citizens that they can use wherever the e-CNY payment is supported, the latest test comes with a theme called \"low carbon summer transportation\" that gives away the e-CNY as allowances to encourage citizens to take more public transportations.","As such, the free e-CNY will arrive with a pre-programed utility for paying for subway and bus tickets through Chengdu's Tianfutong mobile app or for shared bikes on the Meituan mobile app.&nbsp;","This appears to be the first time that the Chinese government is testing the programability of the e-CNY, which is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/81710\/china-digital-currency-patents\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">technology advancement<\/a> on traceability and ensuring a certain fund in the e-CNY form can only be spent on intended purposes.","According to the government's blog post, local residents can register for the lottery starting from July 3 and choose either a \"subway+bike\" or \"bus+bike\" package.","Lottery winners will still need to download and activate a standalone e-CNY mobile app like in previous tests. But different to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/107407\/china-expands-digital-yuan-reach-with-its-latest-giveaway-trial-in-shanghai\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ten tests<\/a> that have been done throughout six Chinese cities so far, the free digital yuan in the latest test won't be given out to lottery winners' e-CNY mobile app wallets.","Rather, the free digital yuan will be credited to a user's Tianfutong or Meituan mobile app as coupons. By activating their e-CNY wallet apps using the same mobile number they have signed in with on Tianfutong or Meituan, users can then activate the coupons and the e-CNY payment option from within the two mobile apps.","To take mass transportation rides, lottery winers in Chengdu will first pay with the e-CNY coupon, which will cover only parts of the fees. They will need to pay the remaining fees from within their e-CNY mobile apps after topping up the balances through their bank accounts.","But it appears users won't be able to convert the values of the e-CNY coupons for taking rides into the general purpose e-CNY stored in their digital yuan wallets.&nbsp;","Earlier this week, it was reported that other Chinese cities are also integrating the e-CNY payment option within their mass transportation systems.&nbsp;","Residents in the Chinese capital city of Beijing who have already activated the e-CNY standalone apps in previous lottery campaigns can now pay for subway fees using the e-CNY across all 24 lines in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/110057\/beijing-suzhou-china-digital-yuan-cny-subway\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Beijing railway system<\/a>, which covers 428 stations.","Â© 2023 The Block.
