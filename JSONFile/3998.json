The digital asset has stayed within a narrow range between around $29,000 and $31,500 for over a month.&nbsp;","Post the Federal Open Market Committee's&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents\/pressreleases\/monetary20230726a.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announcement<\/a>, Bitcoin and major altcoins traded flat. The decision to raise rates to between 5.25% and 5.50% resulted in a subdued crypto market performance. The total cryptocurrency market cap stands at $1.24 trillion \u2014 up by 1.6% in the last 24 hours \u2014 according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinGecko<\/a>.","Fed officials announced inflation data is below expectations after June\u2019s yearly CPI declined to 3%.","Chief economist at BTCM Youwei Yang said this makes a September interest rate hike much less probable and that overall rate hikes may become less aggressive. \"However, the Fed is cautious enough and still kept the door open for some possible additional interest rate hikes, aiming to maintain the current high rate for a longer period, stating that future decisions will highly depend on economic data,\" he told The Block","Yang sees the inflation reading as encouraging in the short term and \"already stimulating emerging assets, including crypto.\"","However, he argued the impact of Fed rate decisions on the crypto market has decayed incrementally. \"The market is now looking for new exciting or worrying indicators to move, and I suspect earnings, regulations, or banking credit liquidity might be the next movers,\" he added.","Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/newsevents.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a press conference<\/a> following the FOMC meeting that further rate hikes could come in September if warranted. \"I would also say it's possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting.
