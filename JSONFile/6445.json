He also confirmed yesterday that the company had explored markets outside the U.S. for an IPO, but any such plans are now on hold.","\u201CWe have looked at other jurisdictions that have clear rules of the road, but honestly, a lot of people go public because they need to raise capital,\u201D Garlinghouse said. \u201CRipple is not really in a place where we need to raise capital, and so it is not a short term priority. We're obviously keeping that option open and we\u2019ll evaluate it as time continues and we\u2019ll evaluate again as we have new regulators sitting at the United States SEC.\u201D","Garlinghouse also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/video\/2024\/01\/16\/ripple-ceo-calls-sec-chair-gary-gensler-a-political-liability.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">referred<\/a> to the current SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, as a \u201Cpolitical liability,\u201D adding that at some point there will be a new chair, which would be a \u201Cgood thing for the American people.\u201D","However, Garlinghouse didn\u2019t see a potential future IPO as an exit for investors. \u201CI don't think about an IPO as an exit. I think about an IPO as a step in the journey,\u201D he said. \u201CShareholder liquidity is important to me. We have investors that first invested in Ripple in 2012, so they've been in this deal for eleven and a half years.\u201D","Garlinghouse added that Ripple had been cash flow positive for the last couple of years, enabling it to invest in the firm\u2019s operations and external acquisitions. Last week, Ripple initiated a $285 million share buyback that valued the company at $11 billion. \u201CAnd so we want to provide that liquidity, which is one of the reasons why we've done these tender offers and now repurchased over a billion dollars of stock,\u201D Garlinghouse said on Tuesday.","In July, a federal district judge sent the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235926\/sec-lawsuit-over-whether-xrp-is-a-security-will-go-to-trial\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple<\/a> to trial, refusing to grant a summary judgment on the status of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248352\/xrp-xrp-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">XRP<\/a> as an unregistered security.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Judge Analisa Torres ruled that <span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248352\/xrp-xrp-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/xrp-symbol-white-128.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">XRP<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -1.72%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span> was not a security on the secondary market but would be a security when sold as part of an investment contract to institutional investors.

Murphy. An outright win for the SEC, with the judge dismissing Coinbase's motion, would be a \"low bar,\" Murphy said, as the SEC merely has to show their claim is plausible. Coinbase has one shot at an outright victory: the judge granting Coinbase's motion with prejudice, meaning the SEC must appeal at a higher court to continue the case, he said.&nbsp;","Coinbase could also secure a narrower victory if the judge grants the motion concerning the tokens but denies it for the staking service. The final unlikely outcome is if the judge grants Coinbase's motion but allows the SEC to amend certain deficiencies, Murphy said.","If Coinbase's motion is dismissed, either in whole or in part, the case will move on to discovery for about a year, Murphy estimated, before a motion for summary judgment. Murphy added he does not expect a ruling in the case at this time.","The SEC did not immediately return a request for comment from The Block.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
