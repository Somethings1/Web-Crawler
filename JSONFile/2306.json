But before Q1 2023 rolls around, here are the top 6 most common PEGA Pool questions answered.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mining pools are collective communities of crypto miners who collaborate and combine their computational resources. The goal is to increase their likelihood of finding new crypto blocks and earning rewards for contributing to Bitcoin mining rounds.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the benefits of adding a block to the blockchain go beyond getting rewarded for their energy and time. BTC miners can also pat themselves on the back for making the crypto-verse an even safer, more secure place for us all. BTC miners help to create unalterable records to prevent fraud and unauthorised activity online.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While Bitcoin (BTC) mining is crucial for growing and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain, it\u2019s also wreaking havoc on the environment. The extensive computational resources of BTC miners consume an incredibly high amount of electricity, which relies on the burning of fossil fuels.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, a primary contributor to global warming.

However, a few trees aren\u2019t enough \u2013 we\u2019d need at least 300 million new trees planted to see a noticeable CO2 offset.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">PEGA Pool is rewarding BTC miners who have already switched gears to renewable energy, in the form of a 50% reduction on pool fees.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the eco-friendly mining pool\u2019s fee reduction is only available to clients who mine BTC using renewable energy, their doors are open to anyone interested in lighting a torch, joining the PEGA Pool army, and blazing the path towards a more sustainable crypto industry.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Not only is PEGA Pool 100% British-owned and -operated, but the eco-friendly mining pool was also ranked as the 13<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">th<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> largest mining pool on the planet by BTC.com.
