With a put call ratio of 0.38, there are likely more than two and half more calls outstanding than puts, according to Luuk Strijers, the chief commercial officer of the crypto futures and options exchange.","There are roughly 700,000 contracts for ethereum options valued at $1.3 billion that are also set to expire, he added.","The dollar amount of the options set to expire is sizable, but that doesn't mean the market has a reason to panic, said Strijers.","\"Implied volume remains at rock bottom level with DVOL trading at 50 for bitcoin and ethereum and shorter-dated even lower but climbing slightly,\" he said. \"Bitcoin and ethereum levels are the same which is historically rare.\"","\"We saw a similar rock bottom IV situation in January this year followed by a big spike afterwards,\" Strijers added.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n",""],"hashtag":[]}
