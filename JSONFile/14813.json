A validator is responsible for processing transactions and creating new blocks on the blockchain.","The attack has the potential to transform the MEV ecosystem because MEV extractors will be wonder \"which Ethereum validators are malicious,\" former Ethereum Foundation member Hudson Jameson said in a tweet.","MEV flashbots use a technique called \"sandwich attacks\" to steal value from users by sending transactions just before and after a victim sends his or her own. This is a malicious way of manipulating the underlying price of the asset so that the bot can steal the price difference from the user.","In this case, OtterSec added that the validator responsible for causing the attack had funded his wallet more than two weeks ago from privacy layer Aztec Network, suggesting that it was a planned attack.","Blockchain sleuth Peckshield revealed that the $20 million in stolen funds are spread across three wallets, with eight linked addresses being originally funded from Indian crypto exchange KuCoin.","Edited by Sheldon Reback and Mark Nacinovich."],"entity":[{"type":"Aztec Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$20 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hudson Jameson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mark Nacinovich","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","MEV","DeFi","Bots","Attacks"],"authors":["Oliver Knight"]}
