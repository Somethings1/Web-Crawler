On the first count, Garlinghouse indicated that Ripple is still pursuing the settlement route.","\"Can't get into specifics, but know we tried \u2014 and will continue to try with the new administration \u2014 to resolve this in a way so the XRP community can continue innovating, consumers are protected and orderly markets are preserved,\" he tweeted.","As for exchanges, he did not clarify whether or not Ripple incentivized venues to list XRP,&nbsp; but said because XRP is decentralized, Ripple has no power over which venues list or delist the asset. In the days since the SEC suit was made public, many venues have halted transactions or delisted XRP.","On the consumer side, he said Ripple lawfully incentivized some customers and first movers to use the network, which according to Garlinghouse is \"building a payments network 101.\"","Garlinghouse also touched on the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/90135\/ripple-series-c-lead-investor-tetragon-sues-the-company\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lawsuit<\/a> from Ripple investor Tetragon, which led the firm's Series C round. Tetragon has filed to require Ripple to redeem its Series C preferred stock.&nbsp;","\"We're disappointed that Tetragon (who owns 1.5% of Ripple) is seeking to unfairly advantage itself through the SEC's allegations,\" said Garlinghouse.","Meanwhile, the SEC's case against Ripple will move forward in February, when both parties meet for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/89634\/sec-ripple-case-initial-pretrial-conference-february-22-xrp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pretrial conference<\/a> on Feb. 22.
