Way back in 2013, FinCEN issued guidance setting forth its view that administrators and exchangers of convertible virtual currency were engaged in money transmission and were required to register with the agency as a money services business (MSB). MSBs have to register with FinCEN, implement a plan to prevent money laundering and file various kinds of reports with the Treasury. Shortly after the guidance was published, the Feds took down Liberty Reserve. They relied on the FinCEN guidance again in 2017 when they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/enforcement_action\/2017-07-26\/Assessment%20for%20BTCeVinnik%20FINAL%20SignDate%2007.26.17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">took action against virtual currency exchange BTC-e<\/a>. Other than those matters, however, FinCEN has been content to leave the regulatory limelight to its more prolific cousin, the SEC. Until last week.","On April 18th, FinCEN made public an \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/enforcement_action\/2019-04-18\/Assessment%20Eric%20Powers%20Final%20for%20Posting%2004.18.19_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">assessment of civil money penalty<\/a>\u201D (meaning a fine, but done in an administrative action by the agency and not in a criminal case filed in court) against Eric Powers for being an unregistered MSB and not having a written anti-money laundering plan and reporting suspicious transactions as required by the MSB regulations. Mr. Powers ran a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange, conducting 1700 transactions over 21 months, and traded millions of dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoin with a number of customers, including people doing business on\u200A\u2014\u200Acue ominous music\u200A\u2014\u200Athe Silk Road. According to FinCEN, Mr. Powers was engaged in money transmission but he wasn\u2019t following the rules.","In case your mind is all full of \u201Cwhen is crypto a security?\u201D and you\u2019ve forgotten all about \u201Cwhen is crypto money transmission?\u201D let\u2019s do a quick refresher. For FinCEN purposes, money transmission is the acceptance of currency or something that substitutes for currency and the transmission of that currency or substitute to another person or location. Currency is broadly defined to include paper money, funds or other value that substitutes for money and thus includes virtual currencies that can be converted into real money. To be a money transmitter, you must both accept value and transmit that value to another person or another location. In a peer-to-peer transaction, the exchange is trading bitcoin with an individual customer and there is no \u201Canother person\u201D to receive the currency substitute. That means for FinCEN to go after a peer-to-peer exchanger like Powers, it has to believe that he is transmitting bitcoin to \u201Canother location.\u201D","FinCEN doesn\u2019t explain what it thinks transmitting virtual currency to another location means, but in its 2013 guidance, it did say that an exchange that accepts dollars and then transmits value to the customer\u2019s virtual currency account is engaged in transmission to another location. And last year, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/coincenter.org\/files\/2018-03\/fincen-ico-letter-march-2018-coin-center.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter to Sen. Ron Wyden<\/a>, the agency stated that a developer who sells virtual currency, including in the form of ICO tokens, in exchange for dollars or other cryptocurrency, in engaged in money transmission. Those examples are interesting, but they don\u2019t really mirror what\u2019s going on with Powers. Nothing in regulations or the guidance makes it clear why exchanging dollars for bitcoin should be viewed as transmitting money to another location. Nothing in the enforcement action lays out which actions by Powers constitute the prohibited behavior. Until FinCEN or a court publishes a definitive philosophical explanation of where a bitcoin is located, assuming geolocation is even a meaningful attribute of a virtual currency, the law in this area is going to remain a bit murky. You didn\u2019t really expect it to get clearer, did you?","There are lots of people operating as peer-to-peer exchanges. Why did FinCEN go after this guy? Pure speculation, but the fact that lots of his customers operated on the Silk Road probably means that he was known to law enforcement and thus became a target. FinCEN also cites to Power\u2019s \u201Cextensive cooperation\u201D which probably explains why he\u2019s not being prosecuted criminally. Should we expect more enforcement actions like this one? Yes. I\u2019ll just point out that last fall FinCEN <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/careers\/enforcement-division\/sat-09082018-0800-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">advertised to hire a Virtual Currency Enforcement Specialist<\/a>. They gotta find something for that person to do.","Finally, on a side note, as it seems to be the norm in virtual currency enforcement actions, FinCEN uses Powers\u2019 internet postings\u200A\u2014\u200Aspecifically statements that he could help people avoid restrictions designed to deter money laundering\u200A\u2014\u200Aagainst him. I refer you to Mr. Palley\u2019s numerous prior admonitions about documenting your crimes on social media.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
