This substantial loan drew attention due to the size of the collateral, which represents <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234138\/curve-finance-michael-egorov-aave\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">over 30%<\/a> of the total circulating supply of CRV.","Gauntlet argued that the proposed freeze on Aave v2 could incentivize Egorov to decrease his borrowing or diversify his collateral types, thereby safeguarding Aave from the accumulation of bad debt resulting from a potential decline in the liquidity of CRV tokens. The firm added that a CRV freeze would encourage the migration of the aforementioned loan position to Aave version 3, which is designed for better risk management.&nbsp;","Egorov's loan account has maintained a <a href=\"https:\/\/debank.com\/profile\/0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">health factor<\/a> above 1.6, indicating no immediate bad debt risk to Aave.","Â© 2023 The Block.
