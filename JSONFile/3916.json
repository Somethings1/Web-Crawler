If the Stoner Cats show was successful, the price of the NFTs could rise and so could the amount of royalties,\u201D the agency said.&nbsp;<\/span>","Stoner Cats 2 did not admit or deny the SEC's findings and agreed to pay $1 million and destroy all NFTs in its possession.","Stoner Cats was one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/113239\/stoner-cats-nft-sale-rakes-in-over-8-million-despite-technical-cat-astrophes\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">first television shows<\/a> to be fully funded by NFTs.
