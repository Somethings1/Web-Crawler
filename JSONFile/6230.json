Claims onboarding and trading are not yet live, Lamb added.","The exchange is the brainchild of the sullied hedge fund investors behind now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital, which was among the most notable victims of crypto's 2022 credit crisis. The former classmates teamed up with Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb to launch the venture via a rebranding of the erstwhile derivatives venue. CEO Leslie Lamb is his wife.","The exchange intends to support trading in bankruptcy claims tied to failed exchanges, like Sam Bankman-Fried's now-bankrupt FTX.","Coinflex rebranded to Open Exchange last month with FLEX as the exchange token. FLEX was trading at $1.97 by 12:10 p.m. EST, down 27% over the past almost 24 hours, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/flex-coin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinGecko<\/a>.","","","OPNX <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/224781\/su-zhu-opnx-launches-token-giveaway\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> on Tuesday along with a giveaway of its native token FLEX as a \"token of our appreciation.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
