Alameda Research has since been shut down.","\"We don't yet have a full picture of what went wrong, and we are following the news online as it unfolds,\" the FTX Future Fund team wrote in the post, adding: \"But to the extent that the leadership of FTX may have engaged in deception or dishonesty, we condemn that behavior in the strongest possible terms.\"","The FTX Foundation also runs FTX Climate and FTX Community philanthropic projects.
