Rather than acting as cryptocurrencies, these tokens represent assets and inventory within companies that can be traced on the Nightfall blockchain. Data and transactions made by OpsChain users will be much cheaper and faster since they're not taking place on the main Ethereum blockchain itself, but on a layer above it.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OpsChain leverages Nightfall's zero-knowledge (ZK)-proofs, a technology that allows for faster and cheaper blockchain transactions while also ensuring privacy.
