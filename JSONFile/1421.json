Such protocols can often be infallible especially when there\u2019s large amounts of funds moving through them in identifiable patterns or clusters of transactions.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ZachXBT found that after Railgun, the funds were consolidated into specific addresses, and moved to three exchanges: Huobi, Binance and OKX, likely in an attempt to convert the assets into fiat money.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At least one centralized exchange has frozen a portion of these assets.
