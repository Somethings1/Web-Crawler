This marks the beginning of a partnership between WhaleFin Technologies and Strata Global which will facilitate Amber Group\u2019s market entry into the UK.","\"Securing the FCA\u2019s approval as an AR is a significant milestone for Amber Group in the UK - a market that is synonymous with a sophisticated financial and regulatory ecosystem, global connectedness, and an intuitive base for crypto demand and innovation in the region,\u201D said Amber Group's Global CEO Michael Wu. \u201CAs we continue to innovate and bring our regulated services to more markets, we are committed to upholding the highest regulatory compliance standards.\u201D","Amber Group first put down its roots in the UK in September 2021, having observed the digital assets market potential in the UK. An FCA study on crypto-assets ownership estimated that there are currently up to 2.3M crypto users in the UK in 2021, an increase from 1.9M in 2020. The study also found that there has been a fundamental attitudinal shift towards cryptocurrency adoption, with more than half of UK users expressing their intention to invest more in crypto-assets as an alternative or in tandem with mainstream investments.","\u201CWe are thrilled to be making inroads into the UK alongside our well-established partner, Strata Global Limited. Together, we look forward to strengthening Amber Group\u2019s foothold in one of the world\u2019s leading financial markets while upholding the standards and trust expected of an FCA-approved institution,\u201D added Wu.","\u201CIt is an incredibly exciting time for us as we support Amber Group in building a business in one of their key markets from the ground up. We are looking forward to a long and successful partnership,\u201D said Strata Global\u2019s co-founder Nick Andrews.","As an AR for an FCA-authorised firm, WhaleFin Technologies will be able to introduce regulated services compliant with the UK financial market regulations. Furthermore, WhaleFin Technologies is in the midst of applying to the FCA for an e-money licence and registering with the FCA's Cryptoasset AML\/CFT regime. Once granted, WhaleFin Technologies will be able to offer an even wider range of services such as debit cards, cryptocurrency trading and digital asset trading to both institutional and retail clients.","Olaf Ammermann, Managing Director of WhaleFin Technologies UK, concluded: \"We are taking a firm step towards becoming a fully regulated and authorised financial services firm in the UK, and to that end, we are committed to building an integrated digital finance company that meets the needs of the UK market for the long term.\u201D","&nbsp;","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About Amber Group<\/strong><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAmber Group is a leading digital asset platform operating globally with offices in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.
