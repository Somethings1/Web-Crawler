The wallet is still able to make other transactions.","Researchers earlier reported that Ledger ConnectKit library, a code repository used by the hardware wallet provider Ledger, was hacked and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/267614\/ledger-connectkit-library-security-flaw-dapps-compromised\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">injected with a malicious code<\/a> draining victims' wallets.

The company said its former employee fell victim to a phishing attack, which enabled the attacker to gain access to their account and add new code.","\"The attacker published a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit (affecting versions 1.1.5, 1.1.6, and 1.1.7). The malicious code used a rogue WalletConnect project to reroute funds to a hacker wallet,\" the ledger team wrote, adding that the company was alerted of the incident and deployed a fix within 40 minutes.","\"The malicious file was live for around 5 hours, however we believe the window where funds were drained was limited to a period of less than two hours,\" Ledger wrote, thanking WalletConnect service, Tether, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis and on-chain sleuth ZachXBT for help.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
