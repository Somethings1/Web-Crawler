Representatives for the U.S. Trustee, an office within the Justice Department that represents the U.S. government in bankruptcy proceedings and helps formalize such committees, said earlier this week that forming this one had been difficult due to the highly international nature of FTX\u2019s customer base.","While U.S. government lawyers have pushed for more transparency in identifying large businesses that FTX owes money to, the collapsed exchange, under its new leadership, has argued to keep that information under seal on the grounds that its client list is a valuable company asset that could be sold to help recoup money. The formation of a creditor committee will allow the matter to move to a conclusion, as the judge presiding over the case had wanted to wait until the committee was formed and able to express its view before making a decision on the matter.","Friction also remains over the fate of the Bahamas arm of FTX's group of companies, FTX Digital Markets.
