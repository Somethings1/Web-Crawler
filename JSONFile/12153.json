A put-call options ratio below one indicates that the call volume exceeds the put volume, signifying bullish sentiment in the market. According to data from The Block dashboard, today's put-call ratio on Deribit is 0.49.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/options\/btc-put-call-ratio\/embed\" title=\"BTC Put\/Call Ratio\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Strijers added that an even more important metric was Friday's elevated skew for call prices compared to puts. \"This means calls are relatively more expensive and driven by increased demand, another bullish signal. Finally, we see the basis, difference between futures and spot, increasing as well.

A call option gives the right to buy and a put offers the right to sell. It is assumed that a trader who buys call options is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
