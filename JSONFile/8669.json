This week we look at three new complaints, one involving lost crypto and a demand for a fork (the software kind), another that says that pre-sold mining hardware contracts were actually securities, and last but not least artificial intelligence on the blockchain (but not so much, it turns out).

According to plaintiffs in this new lawsuit, the answer is yes. Whether a court agrees with that position remains to be seen of course.","This putative class action was first filed in state court in California and removed to federal court on December 28, 2018. (What\u2019s this whole removal thing about? We\u2019ve written about previously, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/crypto-caselaw-minute\/crypto-caselaw-minute-10-18-2018-3a996f24ec8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as in this earlier post<\/a>\u200A\u2014\u200Asee in particular the discussion <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Greenwald v. Ripple Labs<\/em>).","At issue is mining equipment to be used for the Siacoin and Decred cryptocurrencies. Plaintiffs say that the lawsuit \u201Carises out of a scheme by Defendants to raise millions of dollars through the unregistered sale of Mining Appliance Preorders to retail investors\u201D in violation of state consumer protection and securities laws.","According to the lawsuit, defendants sold preorders to the plaintiffs for specialized mining hardware that were advertised as (1) meeting specifications that would allow buyers to make a lot of money once delivered and (2) having a money-back guarantee if they weren\u2019t delivered on time or didn\u2019t meet specifications. This all took place against a backdrop of the cryptocurrency bull-market in 2017.","Plaintiffs say that the equipment wasn\u2019t delivered on time and when it finally arrived didn\u2019t meet specifications in that the actual hash rates (the speed at which computations are performed) were too low to allow the buyers to make any money mining. In spite of this, refunds were refused, plaintiffs allege.","The lawsuit alleges that the presale was really an unregistered securities offering under both California and Massachusetts law, and that defendants also violated consumer protection laws of both states.","With respect to the securities claim, plaintiffs say they","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201Cprovided consideration \u2026 in exchange for their Preorders. Preorder purchasers reasonably expected to derive profits from their Preorders of the Mining Appliances, and Defendants themselves have frequently highlighted this profit motive. Finally the development of the Mining Appliances, and the profits that investors expected to derive therefrom, were, and are, based entirely on the technical, managerial, and entrepeneurial efforts of Defendants[.]\"<\/em>","Plaintiffs later explicitly allege that the pre-sale contracts were securities (using the Howey Test) that should have been registered as such and weren\u2019t. (You might wonder\u200A\u2014\u200Awe did\u200A\u2014\u200Awhy if this alleges California state court securities law violations they didn\u2019t use the more flexible risk capital test, which is California law. I don\u2019t know either).","Plaintiffs also allege violations of consumer protection laws related to the alleged failure to deliver equipment on time and per specification, or to provide refunds when asked. The Complaint is full of written promises to provide refunds, including a statement by one of the defendant that if they failed to meet a specific deadline they were \u201Clegally required to provide a refund.\u201D","If I am handicapping this lawsuit, the consumer protection claims look like they may have more teeth and might be more likely to survive motion practice. The securities claim looks more vulnerable to attack and is a place where I\u2019d expect defense counsel to focus. It may survive motion to dismiss, but pre-selling mining equipment on its face sounds somewhat far afield from an investment contract).","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is delighted to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
