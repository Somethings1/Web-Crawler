Such a deal makes sense, given ICE's desire to innovate in new nascent asset classes.&nbsp;","\"Is there a marketplace for swords and sickles that are on a video game?\" he noted.","\"We aren't crazy, we didn't lose our minds,\" Sprecher said, answering a question about its conversations with eBay. \"We feel really good about our ability to continue to find more asset classes.\"","Following the close of the deal, which is expected to occur later this quarter, Bridge2 will be incorporated into Bakkt.&nbsp;","Bakkt will leverage Bridge2 Solution's merchant relationships to build out its consumer facing application, which will offer a wallet for users to store an array of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and loyalty rewards.","Already, Bridge2 manages loyalty rewards platforms for merchants and financial institutions with a combined total of $60 billion worth of rewards points, as reported by <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2020\/02\/05\/bakkt-rewards-points-bitcoin-cash-wallet\/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE&amp;utm_campaign=fortunemagazine\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fortune<\/a>. It is also working on a pilot called Loyalty Pay, which will allow companies to issue credit cards tied to rewards.&nbsp;","A spokesperson for ICE told The Block the application will be available in the first half of the year, adding that \"users will be able to pay with Bakkt at any merchant through a variety of direct and indirect integrations.\"","The app will also allow users to convert between bitcoin, loyalty points, and in-game rewards in real time. Loyalty Pay will be integrated into the app, but will remain a stand-alone solution, a spokesman said.&nbsp;","Elsewhere, Bakkt is seeing the continued growth of its bitcoin futures product, which launched in September of 2019.&nbsp;","The one-month contract's open interest hit a new all-time high $12.6 million on February 5th, according to data provided by Skew. Volume stood at $16.4 million, bringing the total trading volume for the product to more than $1 billion since launch.&nbsp;","","","The firm also recently launched an option tied to its physically-delivered futures contract.","The contract, which has been less successful than the futures contract, went ten days without trading at the end of January, as The Block previously <a href=\"http:\/\/theblockcrypto.com\/post\/54294\/bakkts-bitcoin-options-saw-zero-volume-last-week\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a>.&nbsp;","Open interest for the contract stood at $0.2 million on February 5th.
