It added that Gem would be gaining access to OpenSea's infrastructure, resources and distribution channels.","For its part OpenSea said, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/blog\/announcements\/opensea-acquires-gem-to-invest-in-pro-experience\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blog post<\/a>, that it will be able to \"learn from Gem\u2019s expertise and intuition about the advanced NFT community.\"","OpenSea added that during the due diligence for the acquisition, it uncovered allegations against a now-former member of Gem's leadership team who goes by the pseudonym Neso.
