Binance.com has been available in Italian <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/support\/announcement\/360006973192\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">since 2018<\/a>.","\u201CWe are aware of the notice from CONSOB and can confirm that Binance.com does not operate out of Italy. This has no direct impact on the services provided on Binance.com,\" a Binance spokesperson told The Block when contacted.","\u201CWe take a collaborative approach in working with regulators and we take our compliance obligations very seriously. We are actively keeping abreast of changing policies, rules and laws in this new space.\u201D","Consob's warning is similar to other regulators' notices and actions against Binance in recent weeks. It all started when the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/109766\/uk-fca-bans-crypto-exchange-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">banned<\/a> Binance Markets Limited (BML) \u2014 Binance's U.K. entity \u2014 saying that the firm is not authorized to operate in the country.","The notice also said that no other entity in the Binance Group was authorized to operate in the U.K. but since Binance's main exchange isn't based in the U.K., it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/109841\/uk-fca-binance-ban-derivatives-spot-trading\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">likely falls outside<\/a> of the cryptoasset regime.","However, the FCA's warning appears to have already impacted Binance's business. The exchange is losing fiat onramps as several British banks, including Santander UK and Barclays, have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/110818\/santander-uk-block-payments-binance-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">moved to block<\/a> user payments to Binance.com.","Binance itself had to suspend customer deposits via the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) due to \"events beyond our control.\" The SEPA network allows customers to send euros across 36 countries.","Besides in Italy and the U.K., regulators of other countries, including the U.S., Japan, Thailand, Poland, and the Cayman Islands, have all either issued warnings or taken action against the exchange recently."],"hashtag":["BINANCE"]}
