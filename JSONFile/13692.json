The five-day streak of net outflows is the longest seen thus far, besting a four-day streak from January of this year.&nbsp;","The strong outflows were matched by weak inflows. Blackrock's IBIT, which captures almost half the market, saw record-low inflows of $49.3 million on Wednesday, March 20, only for that record to be broken on Friday, when IBIT received only $18.9 million in new capital. Fidelity's FBTC, the third-largest spot bitcoin ETF, also saw record-low inflows this week, with merely $2.9 million on Thursday, March 21.&nbsp;","While the strong outflows correspond with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/283323\/grayscale-gbtc-spot-bitcoin-etf-record-outflow\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pullback<\/a> in bitcoin's price, other factors may explain the large outflows: Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284295\/much-of-gbtcs-outflows-come-from-genesis-selling-shares-says-analyst\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> that Grayscale's unusually large outflows may be the result of digital financial firm Genesis's trading.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/cumulative-spot-bitcoin-etf-volumes\/embed\" title=\"Cumulative Spot Bitcoin ETF Volumes\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","And while inflows were net negative, trading volumes were still significant, if slightly lower than recent weeks.
