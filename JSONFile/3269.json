The DeFi protocol currently has a total value locked of $23.4 million, down significantly from a peak of $2.3 billion in February 2021, according to DefiLlama <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/badger-dao?tokenVolume=false&amp;tvl=true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a>.","Lido, Ethereum\u2019s largest liquid staking solution, has a current TVL of <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/lido\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$35.1 billion<\/a>, per DefiLlama, with the market capitalization of stETH ranking among the top ten cryptocurrencies.","\"The eBTC protocol introduces an exceptional new use case for Lido Staked ETH, leveraging the power of staking rewards to provide a more capital-efficient borrowing option for bitcoin on Ethereum,\u201D Lido\u2019s DeFiYaco said.","Users can deposit ether in various forms to borrow over-collateralized eBTC without incurring initiation fees, repayment fees or interest charges typical in DeFi lending protocols. The eBTC protocol then stakes the ether with Lido as stETH, allowing users to earn on their collateral instead of paying fees to borrow.","The protocol generates revenue by taking a percentage of accrued staking yield from the total system collateral, known as the \"protocol yield share.\"","BadgerDAO unveiled a \"purple paper\" for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241431\/badgerdao-purple-paper-ebtc-steth\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">eBTC Protocol<\/a> in July 2023, designed to be a trustless synthetic version of bitcoin in DeFi, adopting a minimized governance mechanism.","The approach ensures the protocol remains non-custodial and censorship-resistant while retaining some flexibility to alter parameters related to fee competitiveness, peg stability, risk management and economic and technical security to adapt to market developments, the team said at the time.","This contrasts with popular wrapped bitcoin tokens like wBTC, which rely on custodial services to manage the bitcoin backing the token, and eliminates the requirement to use cross-chain bridges \u2014 which remain one of the most prominent attack vectors in DeFi.","To ensure the system's solvency, eBTC employs a liquidation mechanism \u2014 meaning that if the collateral ratio of a collateralized debt position falls below a minimum of 110%, the debt position becomes eligible for liquidation. \u201CThe outstanding debt can be repaid by any market participant in exchange for some surplus collateral and the gas stipend as an incentive,\u201D the team said last year.","In cases where a debt position is not liquidated despite its collateral ratio dropping below 103%, the protocol considers this under-collateralized and implements debt redistribution. Liquidators can receive the outstanding collateral at a 3% fixed discount, and any outstanding debt gets redistributed among active collateralized debt positions.","In December 2021, BadgerDAO was exploited for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/126072\/defi-protocol-badgerdao-exploited-for-120-million-in-front-end-attack\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$120 million<\/a> in a front-end attack.
