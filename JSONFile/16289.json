Bloomberg reported that it plans to launch the service as soon as 2024.","Previously, bankrupt crypto exchange FTX\u2019s U.S. arm offered stock trading for its users. Robinhood (HOOD) and Wealthsimple are among the traditional trading platforms currently offering trading of some crypto tokens.","The exchange plans on using a service built by a new division, Kraken Securities, which already acquired the necessary regulatory permits in the U.K. and has yet to be approved in the U.S., the person told Bloomberg.","Kraken declined to comment on the potential for a stock trading platform to CoinDesk. \u201CKraken is always exploring how it can power the global adoption of cryptocurrencies.
