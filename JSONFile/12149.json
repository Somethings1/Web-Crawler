The aim is to enhance privacy protections by addressing the issue of metadata leakage for users.<\/span>","The integration process involves embedding Nym\u2019s mixnet within the Zcash light client libraries developed by the Electric Coin Company. This will enable developers of Zcash wallets to optionally implement the mixnet\u2019s privacy features. Nym has received a $150,000 community grant from Zcash for this.","\u201CI\u2019m extremely pleased to see Nym come to life on the Zcash network. Network-level privacy has been a missing piece since Zcash\u2019s inception,\u201D said Josh Swihart, CEO of Electric Coin Company.","Nym\u2019s team highlighted the pervasive risk of metadata leaks across all online interactions \u2014 positioning its mixnet as a solution to protect this type of data from potential surveillance.","Zcash, known for its optional privacy features through an \u201Cauto-shielding\u201D function, distinguishes itself from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum by complicating the linkage of transactions. Despite these measures, Nym notes that the metadata associated with user transactions remains traceable. Auto-shielding automatically moves funds from a transparent Zcash address to the latest shielded ZEC pool supported by the wallet.","However, should an adversary gain access to a user\u2019s transaction address, they could potentially monitor the user\u2019s wallet activities \u2014 including IP measurements \u2014 over time, as explained by Nym.","While traditional privacy tools like VPNs and Tor are available, Nym asserts that its mixnet solution provides a more comprehensive approach to safeguarding metadata privacy for cryptocurrency transactions.","Nym\u2019s mixnet technology encrypts user-generated data into packets of identical size, then routes these packets through a network of mix nodes globally at randomized intervals. By incorporating dummy \u2018cover\u2019 traffic into this process, the mixnet aims to further obfuscate user data \u2014 making the identification of metadata patterns exceedingly difficult, as claimed by Nym.","Such a strategy brings Zcash into alignment with other crypto projects like Monero, Aztec, and Near, that have previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/260369\/nym-privacy-protections-near-ecosystem\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">collaborated<\/a> with Nym on its mixnet technology.","Recently, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies including Monero and Zcash, have encountered potential delisting threats from centralized exchanges amid regulatory pressures. Notably, Binance has proceeded to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/276176\/binance-delisting-monero?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">delist<\/a> Monero.","Meanwhile, Nym clarified that its metadata encryption through a VPN-like product is not subject to these same regulatory challenges. \u201CExchanges are obviously not a big fan of on-chain privacy, and we hope issues can be resolved. Note that as NYM is a transparent token that provides access to a VPN-like service, this is not an issue for the NYM token itself,\u201D said Harry Halpin, co-founder and CEO of Nym.","Nym Technologies raised $13 million in a 2021 funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), at a valuation of $270 million.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
