Since Validiums encrypt data before adding it to the blockchain, it helps protect users from front-running and <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">market manipulation, Matter Labs said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">zkSync has opened the door to new use cases with platforms like GRVT, a Matter Labs spokesperson told The Block. \"There is nothing like GRVT being built, not in the zkSync ecosystem nor outside of it,\" they said. \"By being able to design and deploy custom hyperchains connected through hyperbridges, teams like GRVT's can build entirely new use cases,\" they added.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The hybrid crypto exchange is expected to launch its closed alpha version next month and mainnet in the first quarter of next year. It aims to offer a transaction speed of up to 600,000 trades per second with less than two milliseconds of latency with zkSync's \"horizontally scaling\" infrastructure.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Horizontally scaling means to deploy additional underlying pairs as new hyperchains,\" GRVT co-founder and CEO Hong Yea told The Block. \"Say BTC\/USDT perpetual futures is one hyperchain and so on. And we can look to add other infrastructure components like this as new hyperchains to scale throughout, as they can interoperate. This allows high-frequency traders to trade more efficiently with high transactions per second similar to a central exchange,\" Yea said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">GRVT is backed by Matter Labs, CMS Holdings and other investors.
