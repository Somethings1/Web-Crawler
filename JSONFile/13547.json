Her social security pension after decades of service, about ten dollars a month, wasn\u2019t enough to consider shopping in the more efficient parallel market.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The texts came from the Fatherland System. The first one informed her that her pension had just been deposited. She sighed.

Seniors with mostly low technology proficiency were compelled to figure out a clunky digital interface just to cash out their money.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But then she got the second message, which informed her of something far more insidious. The state had decided, with no prior warning, to withdraw the money she\u2019d gotten a few hours earlier and place it under a new account, stealthily created on her behalf. The message cheerfully said she was now participating in the \u201Cpetro savings\u201D program.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Remember the petro?

To this date, however, petro buyers haven\u2019t received tradeable tokens. The petro cryptocurrency remains an obscure proof of concept, now a Dash clone whose miners are in secret government locations. With no working wallets to speak of, nobody knows how to make transactions. There are no working exchanges to the hyperinflating local currency, the bolívar, or to any other currency, fiat or crypto. Nothing.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The text, however, made a reference about actual money, money that people were counting on, being sent en masse to new petro accounts.

As far as we can tell, they exist only in a central government database, the very same one that powers the Fatherland System. There is a name for such an architecture.
