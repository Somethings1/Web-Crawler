But this appears to be the first sale worth more than a million dollars at the time of purchase.","This marks a shift in the development of NFTs across the blockchain ecosystem. Since their inception, they have typically been created and sold on the Ethereum blockchain, where the majority of value and interest remains today. But with high fees becoming a growing issue, some investors have looked to other platforms \u2014 such as Solana, Cardano and Tezos \u2014 to experiment at lower costs.","YouTuber-turned-boxer KSI noted this trend, picking up a Solana Monkey Business NFT on Thursday before he was later granted an honorary Degen Ape.","On Friday, he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ksicrypto\/status\/1435046322906832897\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a>, \"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum fees are too high atm so man is moving onto Solana.

TV presenter Steve Harvey changed his Twitter profile photo to a Solana Monkey Business NFT last Thursday.","Within the Solana ecosystem, the building blocks for NFTs have been growing in number during the last few weeks.","There have been the launches of new marketplaces, such as Digital Eyes and SolSea, which are attempting to keep up with the rapidly increasing number of NFT mints. Plus, since the Aurory launch, projects have started using Metaplex's Candy Machine to handle the minting process, which has made for a smoother ride.","On the other hand, the multiplication of the number of NFT projects on Solana has started to dilute the value among the collections \u2014 despite high demand for earlier projects like the degenerate apes. Many projects have seen their floor prices slide in recent days, with some mints not selling out and a number of projects selling below minting price.","At the same time, the price of Solana's native token, SOL, has been rocketing up, rising from $100 to briefly break $200 in little over a week \u2014 propelling it into the top 10 coins by market cap. To reflect this rise, NFT projects have started lowering their mint prices, to keep them affordable.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The price of Solana has rallied over the last 30 days.

Upcoming snake-themed NFT project Sneks revised its prices from 2.25 SOL to 0 SOL, following a failed launch, while Lit Jesus is handing its NFTs (and physical copies) out for free.
