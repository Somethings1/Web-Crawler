For context, when CurioNFT mints an NFT it generates carbon emissions equivalent to sending approximately 17 emails with attachments. Committed to carbon neutrality, CurioNFT has offset emissions by planting over 12,000 trees and counting. As of September, CurioNFT\u2019s environmental efforts have offset over 300% of the carbon created by NFT sales.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The partnership has also pledged to donate 10% of sales to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/tumo.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TUMO<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.
