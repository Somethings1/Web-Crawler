The new techniques are explored in&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/a16zcrypto.com\/posts\/article\/introducing-lasso-and-jolt\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">two research papers<\/a> that a16z crypto research partner Justin Thaler and the engineering team have developed.","Zero-knowledge protocols enable one party to affirm the truth of a statement to another party without revealing anything beyond the fact itself. This technology is vital in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162098\/zk-rollups-likely-to-be-main-layer-2-solution-for-ethereum-says-vitalik-buterin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ZK-rollups<\/a>, a prevalent Layer 2 scaling solution within the blockchain domain.","Lasso, a16z\u2019s main innovation of the two research papers, employs a \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/a16zcrypto.com\/posts\/article\/introducing-lasso-and-jolt\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lookup argument<\/a>\u201D mechanism that facilitates quicker zero-knowledge proofs. It matches specific inputs with corresponding outputs without disclosing extra information. \u201CLasso introduces a streamlined approach to verifying SNARKs, avoiding tedious hand-optimized circuits by performing lookups against massive structured tables,\u201D the team noted.","The research team at a16z crypto said that Lasso could significantly increase the overall speed of SNARK provers, attaining a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/a16z\/Lasso\/blob\/master\/src\/benches\/m1_16gb_parallel_benches.log\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tenfold<\/a> performance increase compared to tools like the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/privacy-scaling-explorations\/halo2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Halo2<\/a> toolchain \u2014 thereby being useful in developing faster ZK-rollups.&nbsp;","SNARKs help scale blockchains, like Ethereum, by allowing applications to produce receipts for costly computations off-chain. Despite this, the technology may remain slow and intricate for developers. Lasso seeks to enhance the efficiency of SNARKs, making them potentially more practical compared to current solutions.","Benchmark results shared by the firm highlight Lasso\u2019s significant performance enhancement over current solutions. The team pointed to a potential \u201C10x speedup,\u201D with continuing optimizations that could lead to \u201C40x\u201D improvements. Consequently, the team has suggested that Lasso\u2019s prover technology will outpace all existing zero-knowledge SNARK prover techniques employed by major Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions.","Along with Lasso, a16z crypto released Jolt, a framework designed for Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible roll-ups. It\u2019s described as a novel method to build SNARK VMs \u2014 a virtual machine execution proved via a SNARK \u2014 that utilizes Lasso. This could allow developers to create quicker SNARK-based Layer 2 rollups using their preferred programming languages, the team added.","The Lasso codebase, written in Rust, has been made available on GitHub.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
