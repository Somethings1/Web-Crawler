Many people in crypto believe that because some market platforms can exist in a completely decentralized way that they are therefore immune to regulation or impossible to regulate via law. That\u2019s not so, Behnam said.","\u201CIt\u2019s easy to suggest, \u2018Oh there\u2019s no institution, there\u2019s no individual, it\u2019s just code, you can\u2019t regulate that, it\u2019s self-effectuating,\u2019 but that really is the wrong set of questions. It\u2019s really about what are U.S. customers being offered and exposed to? And who is either the individual or group of individuals who set up that entity, that code, to offer those products?\u201D he said.","\u201CWe\u2019ll continue bringing bad actors to account here,\u201D he added.","He did suggest there is one area where crypto will be lightly regulated by the CFTC: markets where tokens exist purely as a cash substitute and not as any other kind of asset, because the CFTC doesn\u2019t regulate cash markets. \u201CI don\u2019t have legal authority to police cash crypto markets. We do have this very limited authority within the CFTC to police cash markets if there is fraud or manipulation,\u201D he said.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/223015\/cftc-sues-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The CFTC made headlines in March when it sued Binance<\/a>, a centralized exchange, for allegedly doing business in the U.S. without registering as a commodities exchange. It also accused Binance of turning a blind eye to financial crime and money laundering occurring on its platform. Binance denies the allegations.","Odd Lots host Tracy Alloway suggested listeners should read the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/223143\/binance-details-from-cftc-complaint\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CFTC's complaint<\/a> for its entertainment value because of the number of internal messages it cites in which Binance executives appear to admit they are engaged in wrongdoing.","\u201CIt was not our intent to entertain,\u201D Behnam said, while adding, \u201Cnothing surprises me anymore\u2026 we know there\u2019s a lot of individuals out there who don\u2019t want to comply with the law, choose to evade the law or don\u2019t know about the law \u2014 and sometimes they will do things that are surprising, including writing stuff down.\u201D","He went further to dispel the notion that crypto is in some way not currently covered by U.S. law.","\u201CWe have to drive our legal analysis from legal precedent,\u201D he said, referring to the Howey Test which defines whether a contract involves a security. \u201CAnd that, for better or for worse, is the driving force that sits as the foundation of our legal analysis to this day for digital assets when we think about that question of securities versus commodities.\u201D","He did suggest that there was one undecided area of law around crypto: The question of whether a token can be launched as a security (if for instance the company launching it makes promises about its future utility or value) that might later devolve into a commodity when it becomes traded on decentralized exchanges purely as a cash substitute.","\u201CThere are many characteristics about the digital financial assets which are common to traditional financial assets but there are certainly many characteristics which are unique and, I think, demand a unique set of thoughts and policy ideas about how and whether we should regulate it,\u201D he said.","A new token might initially involve the \u201Cpooling of capital to start a project,\u201D which would make it look like a security, he said. But it\u2019s an open question as to what happens when such a token \u201Cflips from being a security to being a commodity due to decentralization.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
