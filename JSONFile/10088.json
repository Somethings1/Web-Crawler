At its core, cryptocurrencies offer unique features that have only just been made possible, with immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization and scarcity \u2014 fundamentally different from CBDCs.\u201D","\u201CThe digitization of money is the future, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before CBDCs are integrated into existing payment systems,\u201D he added. \u201CHowever, if the U.S. government decides to establish a CBDC, it should be solely based on its technological advantages and merits.\u201D","Mahendra cited examples in other countries such as Project Rosalind in the UK, where companies like Quant Network were selected to collaborate with the Bank for International Settlements and Bank of England to develop APIs for CBDCs and bring the concept closer to reality.","The portfolio manager believes that \u201Ccash and cryptocurrencies can co-exist alongside a government-issued currency.\u201D However, \u201Cindividuals should have the freedom to choose their preferred payment methods, including the choice not to solely use a CBDC,\u201D he added.","Mahendra suggested that CBDCs could help over 7 million unbanked Americans, plus billions globally, while reducing criminal activity and cross-border fees.","\u201CIt\u2019s been proposed that CBDCs will help over 7 million Americans, on top of billions of individuals across the globe who are unbanked, as well as reduce criminal activity by allowing the government to easily track payments. By improving the cross-border payment system that burdens immigrants with excessive fees, it could really make a difference in day-to-day lives,\u201D he said.","The latest pledge by the U.S. presidential candidate, made at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?529323-7\/gov-ron-desantis-speaks-2023-family-leadership-summit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Family Leadership Summit<\/a> in Iowa on Friday, follows a similar move in March \u2014 when DeSantis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221281\/desantis-touts-bill-that-would-ban-use-of-cbdcs-in-florida\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">touted<\/a> a bill to ban any use of a Fed-backed digital currency in Florida, where he is currently Governor.","In early May, DeSantis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229539\/they-want-to-get-rid-of-crypto-florida-governor-ron-desantis-warns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claimed<\/a> the Biden administration wants \u201Cto get rid of crypto,\u201D and previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221281\/desantis-touts-bill-that-would-ban-use-of-cbdcs-in-florida\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">accused<\/a> President Joe Biden of eyeing the technology for \u201Csurveillance and control.\u201D While the Republican is an avid critic of centrally controlled digital currencies, he has expressed support for decentralized cryptocurrencies that the government has no control over.","On May 24, DeSantis officially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232135\/desantis-promises-to-protect-bitcoin-in-presidential-campaign-launch-event\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> his presidential campaign in a Twitter Spaces event with Elon Musk, promising to protect bitcoin if he is elected next year. \"I just do not have an itch to have to control everything that people may be doing in this space, and I think the current regime, clearly, they have it out for bitcoin, and if it continues for another four years, they'll probably end up killing it,\" DeSantis said at the time.","Â© 2023 The Block.
