The solution for web3 to realize its true multichain potential, connecting all liquidities, assets and users of the many chains, seems to be through a uniquely designed \u201Cself verifying\u201D cross-chain infrastructure that has been gaining a lot of traction lately among the layer-1s \u2013 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplabs.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MAP Protocol<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What is MAP Protocol<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Built on Light Client and Zero-Knowledge (\u201Czk\u201D) technologies and fully open source, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.maplabs.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MAP Protocol<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> spent 4 years in engineering the unique \u201Cprovably secure\u201D cross-chain infrastructure with a \u201Cself verification\u201D<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mechanism, supporting both EVM and non-EVM chains, with instant confirmation time, which they called the \u201COmnichain Network\u201D.

The relay chain architecture allows for multi-chain scaling, and avoids the risk of insecure cross-chain messages. Further, the unique zero-knowledge-proof-based light client design reduces the difficulty of heterogeneous chain development, and ensures the security of cross-chain message transmission. Given Map Protocol's compatibility with almost all blockchains and its support for native deployment of DApps on relay chains, it will become an essential component of cross-chain applications and can very well become instrumental for cross-chain technologies\u2019 future.\u201D - <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yang Liu, professor, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University.<\/span><\/i>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSecurity is MAP Protocol\u2019s first priority which is why they chose Certik as their long term auditing partner.\u201D - <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jason Jian, CBO of Certik.<\/span><\/i>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf layer-2s gave birth to a new era of scalability, MAP Protocol\u2019s Omnichain Network is here to give birth to a new era of interoperability<\/span> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">- the Omnichain Era.
