To enhance scalability of Ethereum-based apps, Polygon employs two scaling techniques: a sidechain named Polygon PoS and a zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup network known as Polygon zkEVM.&nbsp;","zkEVM is the one that would particularly benefit from Dencun. Its&nbsp;co-founder and technical lead Jordi Baylina shared insights on the current challenges faced by ZK rollups (such as zkEVM), primarily centered on the cost of data availability. \u201CThe main challenge for ZK rollups right now is the cost of data availability,\u201D Baylina stated, underscoring the significance of EIP-4844 in potentially reshaping the capacity and gas fees landscape on Polygon zkEVM.","He further predicted a \u201Cthreefold increase in Ethereum\u2019s total data availability capacity\u201D following the implementation of EIP-4844 within the Dencun upgrade that would tremendously help ZK rollups, including Polygon zkEVM and others like Linea, Scroll, and zkSync. Baylina also provided projections on cost reductions, estimating \u201Ca potential cost reduction ranging from 10x to 50x when combining EIP-4844 with data compression,\u201D while also noting that \u201Cthe actual savings will depend on various factors.\u201D","Addressing the technical preparations for the upgrade, Baylina highlighted that while the transition to Dencun might be more straightforward for optimistic rollups (such as Optimism and Arbitrum), the integration of EIP-4844 into Polygon zkEVM, which utilizes ZK rollup technology, requires specific technical modifications. \u201CZK rollups are at a slight disadvantage compared to optimistic rollups because they must incorporate BLS pairings within their proofs,\u201D he explained. This necessitates a precompiled smart contract for these cryptographic pairings, which was introduced in the Etrog hard fork of Polygon zkEVM in February.","Looking ahead to the full integration of EIP-4844, Baylina noted the necessity of a new proof system on zkEVM that supports data compression in order to optimize the benefits of EIP-4844 for Polygon zkEVM. \u201CA new proof system is necessary, one that will facilitate data compression,\u201D he said, indicating that work is ongoing to develop such a system.","Baylina added that efforts are being diligently pursued to ensure that all necessary components are aligned with the activation of the Dencun hard fork on the mainnet.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
