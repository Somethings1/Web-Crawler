It's part of The9's ongoing effort to seek electricity and facilities in different regions to deploy its bitcoin mining equipment either through proprietary capacity or colocation providers.","Originally an online gaming firm listed on Nasdaq, The9 revealed its pivot into mining in January and began operating in February. As of the end of March, it owned about 126 BTC, per a regulatory filing in the U.S.&nbsp;","The bitcoin mining company is facing regulatory headwinds due to provincial governments in China handing down orders to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/110499\/a-timeline-of-chinas-bitcoin-mining-crackdown-and-how-it-goes-beyond-environmental-concerns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cut off energy supplies<\/a> for bitcoin mining facilities in June.","The 15 megawatts reserved so far at BitRiver appears to be far from enough, however, for housing all of the equipment that The9 purchased earlier this year, based on the tech specification of these purchases.","Based on its 2020 annual report <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001296774\/000110465921043144\/tm211771d1_20f.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">released<\/a> in March, The9 issued several rounds of new equity in Q1 to raise money for purchasing an older generation of bitcoin mining equipment when there was a supply crunch for the newest generation of machines.","Between January and March, The9 bought over 35,000 old bitcoin ASIC miners with a combined hashing power of 745 petahashes per second.","It deployed the majority of them in Chinese provinces including Sichuan, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and Gansu, the company said in the annual report.","In March, The9 further <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/98796\/bitcoin-miners-150-million-the9-blockcap\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">signed<\/a> a purchase agreement with Bitmain to buy 24,000 new models of Bitmain's flagship AntMiner S19j for $82 million.
