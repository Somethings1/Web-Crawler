This system allows Robinhood to offer commission-free trading, but the system is not without its critics. This routes orders through a handful of large electronic trading firms that are paying the broker, and some argue that retail traders don't get the best price in this system.","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There has been an ongoing argument over<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> whether the U.S. business model for low-cost trading apps like Robinhood is ethical, Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told The Block on Thursday. <\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The SEC\u2019s latest decision to allow the payment for order flow model these platforms use is a major milestone in the argument, but it\u2019s certainly not the end,\" she said.&nbsp;<\/span>","Hoy went on to say this practice has been banned in many countries, and while the SEC has<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;stopped short of doing that, the regulator still has space to make the practice a bit less lucrative. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COver the next few months, we\u2019re likely to hear just how the SEC will tackle the issue, which could add to the volatility that stocks like Robinhood have experienced of late,\" she said. \"After a pandemic-fueled boom, the industry\u2019s been in the hot seat as rising interest rates make trading stocks look less appealing, so any attack on the underlying business model could see the recent gains erased.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","Robinhood shares spiked 9% after the open on Thursday, having surged throughout pre-market trading.
