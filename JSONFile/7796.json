GrainChain hopes that, with blockchain, farmers\u2019 compliance activities to all of these requirements can be registered in a trustworthy way and reduce costs.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COur platform provides guarantees and visibility through the entire process, which empowers growers and vendors while reducing risk to bankers and buyers,\u201D said GrainChain CEO Luis Macias.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When farmers' compliance practices are audited, GrainChain\u2019s system will also automatically reward them with small loans deposited into their digital wallets. These loans are provided by banks GrainChain partners with and many recipients are previously unbanked due to a lack of credit history, said Macias. Farmers can use these loans to purchase farming supplies from vendors. According to Macias, a portion of the credits in the digital wallets can also be redeemed for fiat currencies.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meanwhile, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sales of fair trade-certified goods are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/unctad.org\/en\/pages\/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2197\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">growing<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> fast while the fair trade and organic certification models are facing <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">public <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ssir.org\/articles\/entry\/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">scrutiny<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.
