BlackRock\u2019s IBIT, Grayscale\u2019s GBTC and Fidelity\u2019s FBTC funds have been the leading contributors to this volume, with IBIT and FBTC also leading in inflows. GBTC, on the other hand, has seen over $11 billion worth of outflows to date, according to BitMEX Research <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BitMEXResearch\/status\/1767451778054807797\/photo\/1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data.<\/a>","Earlier this year, JPMorgan analysts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/272099\/jpmorgan-spot-bitcoin-etfs-36-billion-inflows\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">projected<\/a> that GBTC could see outflows of up to $13 billion in 2024, largely attributed to its 1.5% fees, which are quite high compared to other spot bitcoin ETFs. They also anticipated a surge in popularity for spot bitcoin ETFs among retail investors, with institutional investors potentially transitioning from futures-based ETFs and GBTC to spot bitcoin ETFs. The current 90% daily volume market share of spot bitcoin ETFs appears to align with the analysts' prediction.","The price of bitcoin has skyrocketed this year, currently trading at around $72,150, according to The Block\u2019s prices page. Bitcoin has been setting new records as more money flows into spot bitcoin ETFs due to the cryptocurrency's price surge, not the other way around, according to FalconX\u2019s head of research, David Lawant. \"If until about one week ago spot ETF inflows were driving prices, I have the impression that more recently prices are, at least to some extent, starting to also drive inflows,\" Lawant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.falconx.io\/newsroom\/crypto-markets-surge-widespread-gains-beyond-majors-btc-and-eth\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> on Friday.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
