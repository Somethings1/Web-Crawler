Per White Rock Management's calculations, it recycles approximately 82 million cubic feet of natural gas per megawatt.","\u201CThe Brazos Valley mine is the first of several grid-independent facilities we are planning in Texas that will utilize by-product natural gas from active oil wells, turning waste into a reliable, non-grid energy source,\u201D said Andy Long, CEO of White Rock Management.","The company is also considering expanding to North America, Europe and Latin America, as well as&nbsp;mergers and acquisitions.","\"We are also seeking potential M&amp;A opportunities within the bitcoin mining industry, as the current market environment is conducive to both M&amp;A and strategic partnerships,\" said founder Serhiy Tron.","The company's other existing bitcoin mining facility is in Sweden and has a capacity of 30 megawatts.","Â© 2023 The Block.
