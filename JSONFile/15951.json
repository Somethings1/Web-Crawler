The company said the test could help \u201Creduce spam, manipulation of our platform and bot activity,\u201D as any new user will be charged to use critical functions including posting, replying and liking.","However, previous efforts to charge users have seemingly failed to entirely prevent phishing scams by verified accounts on the platform. X\u2019s premium service \u2013 which costs $8 a month and rewards a blue tick to users \u2013 is seemingly extensively used by crypto-focused bot armies and scammers.","Such phishing bots are ever-present on posts made by verified accounts. Replies to several different CoinDesk posts show the blue-tick verified bots ploy their trade \u2013 hoping to capture the attention of an unsuspecting user, who clicks on the link only to discover their wallet has been fully drained a few minutes later.","Market observers working in crypto security services believe that while the charge may help dissuade some bots, other measures are far more likely to create an impact.","\"While this new program is well-intentioned, it may be more effective to enhance reporting measures to resolve existing issues,\u201D explained Veronica Wong, CEO of crypto wallet SafePal. \u201CDespite having dedicated team members reporting bot and scam accounts to safeguard our users, it is a never-ending battle as the process takes time and new X accounts are always popping up.\u201D","\u201CUsers may still be vulnerable to bot accounts with blue and gold checkmarks since those are unaffected, and stringent vetting to deny scam ads will be more crucial to mitigate this,\u201D Wong added.","Wong, however, noted that X\u2019s premium service for businesses, which rewards a gold checkmark to accounts made it \u201Cnoticeably harder for bots and impersonators to execute malicious attacks.\u201D","Meanwhile, some crypto funds say using blockchain could quell the extensive bots menace.","\u201CThe pervasive issue of botting stands as a formidable challenge, casting a long shadow of doubt upon the industry's reputation,\u201D shared DFG Founder and CEO James Wo. \u201CThe ill-gotten gains from perpetrating these scams substantially outweigh any associated expenses.\u201D","\u201CAttempts to quell this issue with a mere $1 annual fee appear insufficient in the face of determined groups. As a solution, we think that Web2 platforms will need to consider implementing Proof of Personhood and Decentralized Identity (DID) methods to deal with bot problem effectively,\u201D Wo added.","A decentralized identifier (DID) identifies a user without relying on a centralized company or organization.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"New Zealand","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"the Philippines","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"DFG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$8","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Wong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Veronica Wong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["scam","Elon Musk"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
