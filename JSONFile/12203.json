However, this also brings about the issues of fragmented user experience and liquidity.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Taking the Liquid Staking (LS) sector as an example, most Liquid Staking protocols, such as the largest, Lido, deploy instances on multiple chains to support cross-chain Liquid Staking. However, these instances are independent of each other and lack interoperability. These Liquid Staking Token (LST) assets created by these instances can only circulate within their respective native chains and cannot be integrated into the multi-chain ecosystem.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Recently, Bifrost has launched a new Liquid Staking Dapp. Through this Dapp, users can remotely stake, redeem and swap any LST of Bifrost. For example, users can directly stake vDOT, Bifrost LST for staked DOT on various EVM Parachains such as Moonbeam and Astar, without having to cross-chain and transfer it to the EVM chain.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">You can visit the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/omni.ls\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Omni LS Dapp<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to experience it, directly.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The functionalities of the Omni LS Dapp are achieved through the use of a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/forum.polkadot.network\/t\/slpx-the-omni-chain-liquid-staking-vision-via-xcm\/3836\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cross-chain Architecture<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The Bifrost Staking Liquidity Protocol (SLP) module is built on this architecture, where the staking and redeeming of the LST is performed on a unified chain, on Bifrost. As a result, the liquidity hubs of these LSTs are aggregated and originate on this \u201Cheadquarter\u201D chain. Other chains have lightweight remote \u201Cbranch\u201D modules to support users and Dapps in remotely accessing the SLP module, tapping in and utilizing this liquidity.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As a result, users can stake, redeem and swap Bifrost LSTs through remote calls, regardless of the chain they are on, just like operating locally without experiencing the underlying cross-chain process. Furthermore, users don't need to worry about which chain their assets are on; they can use Bifrost's services anytime, anywhere.
