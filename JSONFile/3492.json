Not only is this process \"cumbersome,\" but it can also expose investors to counterparty risk, Arwen CEO Sharon Goldberg told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arwen develops a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arwen.io\/whitepaper.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Layer 2 protocol<\/a> that is similar to the Lightning Network but works across different blockchains. Under the protocol, every trade will first require two escrows funded by the two counterparties. After the trade is finalized, an atomic swap will be performed, switching ownership of the escrowed funds and automatically completing the settlement process.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThat whole process of checking and manually doing a lot of these bilateral trades is very slow, cumbersome, and unautomated. That's where we are focusing on, to make sure the settlement is more efficient,\u201D said Goldberg.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arwen launched its mainnet in April 2019. At the time, the firm primarily catered to retail investors and partnered with centralized exchange KuCoin to allow users to trade on the platform without conceding autonomy over their private keys. The protocol currently supports trading of bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), and ether (ETH).&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CTrading efficiency, liquidity, and ease of use are critical for markets to adopt new technologies and new processes.
