But the case was <a href=\"http:\/\/coindesk.com\/inside-bitewei-the-20-million-bitcoin-miner-being-hailed-as-a-bitmain-rival\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dismissed<\/a> by the Beijing IP Court in 2018, which also revoked Bitmain's authorized patent altogether.&nbsp;","But it seems <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/10159\/hashpower-share-operated-by-bitmain-dwindles-to-a-16-month-low\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain<\/a> still hasn't given up, with the new civil case demanding a damage claim of as much as 99 million yuan, or $15 million, from MicroBT.","The new case again puts the spotlight to the long-time rivalry between the two firms, as MicroBT's growth since 2019 has significantly eroded Bitmain's dominance in the bitcoin mining hardware market.","According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ipeconomy.cn\/index.php\/mobile\/news\/magazine_details\/id\/2592.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IPEconomy<\/a>, the Beijing IP Court notified Bitmain that it has received the complaint and will proceed accordingly. It's unclear when the first hearing will be scheduled.","Per the report, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/17279\/bitmains-ipo-application-expires-company-appoints-new-ceo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain<\/a> has accused Yang of stealing corporate secrets after he completed the research and development for Bitmain's once flagship mining equipment the AntMiner S7 and S9 in May 2016. Bitmain further argued that Yang founded MicroBT to launch a rival product in July before he officially left Bitmain.","Yet Yang's <a href=\"http:\/\/coindesk.com\/inside-bitewei-the-20-million-bitcoin-miner-being-hailed-as-a-bitmain-rival\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recount of the history<\/a>, outlined in a 2018 profile published by CoinDesk, tells a different story.","The history of the feud dates back to 2014 when Yang joined ASICMiner, a bitcoin mining hardware maker founded in 2012 by Jiang Xinyu \u2013 also known as Friedcat on bitcointalk.org.","Shortly after Friedcat's mysterious disappearance in early 2015, Yang said he joined <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/2084\/bitmain-releases-firmware-to-enable-overt-asicboost\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain<\/a> after having presented his full-custom chip design technology to Micree Zhan, Bitmain's co-founder and chairman.","But Yang said he was on a part-time gig designing chips for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/2234\/coindesk-bitmain-misled-investors-in-pre-ipo-funding-round\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain's<\/a> S7 in Shanghai as he didn't initially fit in with Bitmain's \"working environment\" and \"didn't feel respected.\"","Bitmain rolled out the S7 in August 2015 and Yang said he subsequently had several rounds of equity negotiations while designing the S9, which was launched a year later.&nbsp;","Per Yang's recount, the talks didn't go well. Although <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/2875\/bitmain-announces-new-sha256-7nm-miners\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain's<\/a> other co-founder, Jihan Wu, was willing to offer two percent of equity, Zhan was said to only comfortable with 0.5 percent.","As the talks fell through, Yang said he ended his contract with Bitmain in June 2016 and launched MicroBT a month later.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the success of the AntMiner S7 and S9 brought Bitmain some $1 billion in net profits during the 2017 bull market, with millions of units sold in one year.","The dispute also brought to the fore some of Yang's recent legal troubles. Bitmain's second lawsuit comes months after the Shenzhen prosecutor released Yang from a criminal charge, which was believed to be reported by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/3003\/bitmain-rushes-to-deploy-90000-miners-ahead-of-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain<\/a>.","Yang was arrested in December 2019 by the police in Shenzhen under a charge of embezzlement but was released on parole at least as of August 2020, per an <a href=\"http:\/\/static.sse.com.cn\/stock\/information\/c\/202009\/34f0f0454eed43b7a5390f4d99a4d96e.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IPO filing<\/a> to the Shanghai Stock Exchange by a MicroBT supplier, whose main revenue came from testing chips for the manufacturer.","The arrest came at the back of MicroBT's growth period in 2019. Per the supplier's IPO filing, MicroBT's revenues grew from $62 million in 2017, to $230 million in 2018 and $626 million in 2019.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
