Stake DAO, another DeFi platform, is lined up to build yield generation strategies using Aave and Curve\u2019s upcoming deployments on the network.","In the first phase of the program, AVAX \u2013 the network\u2019s native currency \u2013 will be used as a liquidity mining incentive for Aave and Curve users over a three-month period. The foundation has set aside $20 million worth of AVAX for Aave users and $7 million for Curve users. Further allocations are planned for the second phase of the scheme over the coming months.","\u201CThis is an allocation for effectively a fund that will be disbursed over time, not all of that amount has been allocated,\u201D said Luigi D\u2019Onorio DeMeo, a director at Ava Labs. \u201CThis is really our effort to showcase what Avalanche can do as a Layer 1 technology and bring over some of the largest protocols that exist.\u201D","The foundation is an organization distinct from Ava Labs; whereas the latter is a software development company (akin to ConsenSys in the context of the Ethereum), the foundation plays a broader support role for the ecosystem at large.","Avalanche, a proof-of-stake protocol, touts its smart contracts platform as the fastest in the blockchain space. Launched in September 2020, the protocol today underpins more than 225 projects, including Tether, Chainlink, Circle and The Graph.","The Avalanche Rush incentive scheme follows the launch of a new cross-chain bridge project that enables the smooth transfer of assets between blockchains.","In February, the team behind Avalanche <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/94159\/bridge-avalanche-ethereum-defi-networks\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">unveiled a new bridge<\/a> connecting it with the Ethereum network \u2013 allowing DeFi users to transfer assets over. But that first bridge did not work particularly well, according to Emin Gün Sirer, director at the Avalanche Foundation. It proved expensive to use and offered a poor user experience \u201Con days when Ethereum had hiccups,\u201D he explained.","\u201CWe recently got a new bridge, a lot of this was predicated on the bridge. We were waiting for a bridge technology that was easy to use and cheap for bringing assets over,\u201D Gün Sirer continued.","With the better bridge, the incentive scheme up and running, and some of DeFi\u2019s best-known protocols involved, Avalanche\u2019s claims of superior speed will be put to the test.","\u201CI think every one of these new launches is both a challenge and an opportunity for us and it\u2019s always going to be a testament to just how scalable the underlying technology is,\u201D said Gün Sirer."],"hashtag":["AAVE","AVALANCHE"]}
