The website does not provide any other details, except that it was acquired in 2019.","Genesis CTO, Pat DeFrancesco, said that the firm will add Qu Capital\u2019s tools, which incorporate machine learning and other advanced technologies, into its existing technology stack and new product offerings.","While the firm did not disclose any details on the new offerings, Moro recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/29627\/genesis-global-trading-hires-4-new-executives-expands-into-europe\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told The Block<\/a> that Genesis could be building an integrated platform where trading and lending can be accessed through one clickable graphical user interface. The CEO hinted at users being able to get lending rates via an application programming interface so that customers won\u2019t have to call or email the firm.","Genesis, a Digital Currency Group company, has been taking significant steps in its development.
