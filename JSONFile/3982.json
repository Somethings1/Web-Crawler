Gewal says Coinbase is just looking for consistency.","\u201CWe\u2019re not saying we don\u2019t want to be regulated. We\u2019re just saying that regulation all ought to occur under the rule of law that is in a manner that\u2019s consistent with what Congress wrote,\u201D he added.","One particular inconsistency Grewal points out is how the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s request for crypto exchanges to register as national securities exchanges clashes with Coinbase's explicit policy of not listing securities:","\u201CFor there to be no distinction drawn between the products that are securities and the products that aren\u2019t, is effectively saying that we would have to agree that the rule of law doesn\u2019t matter and that even though Congress limited the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction to securities and securities alone, we should come in and register anyway,\u201D Grewal said.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro and Grewal also discuss:<\/em>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"http:\/\/Circle.com\/Scoop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Circle<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/railgun.app.link\/thescoop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Railgun<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/flare.network\/?utm_source=TDE&amp;utm_medium=Podcast&amp;utm_campaign=TheBlock\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Flare Network<\/a><\/i><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/em><\/b><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAbout Circle<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/strong><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Circle is a global financial technology company helping money move at internet speed.
