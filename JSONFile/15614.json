A judge still needs to sign off on the agreement.","\"We\u2019re pleased to have been able to reach a result, with the assistance of Judge Goldblatt, that allows BlockFi\u2019s claims against FTX for the full value of loans to Alameda and assets on the FTX exchange, waives \u201Cclawback\u201D claims by FTX that could diminish those claims, and provides BlockFi with a partially secured claim,\" Kenneth Aulet, partner at Brown Rudnick, which represented the Committee of Unsecured Creditors, said in an emailed statement. \"[It is] an excellent outcome for BlockFi\u2019s customers and creditors.\"","FTX, Alameda, and BlockFi had a complicated and intertwined relationship. BlockFi received a $400 million line of credit from FTX, and FTX, under its legal name West Realm Shires, was one of BlockFi's largest creditors with a $275 million claim.","\"This negotiated agreement represents an excellent outcome for BlockFi and its customers \u2013 one better than could have been anticipated even on the effective date of the Plan,\" BlockFi's bankruptcy administrators wrote in the filing. \"[This Plan] ensures that money reserved for litigation with FTX is directed instead to customer distributions.\"","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"$275 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Committee of Unsecured Creditors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$250 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"West Realm Shires","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kenneth Aulet","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alameda","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$874.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Brown Rudnick","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Goldblatt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$400 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["BlockFi","FTX","FTX Collapse","Alameda Research","Zac Prince"],"authors":["Sam Reynolds"]}
