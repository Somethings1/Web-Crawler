These assets are distributed to node operators within Stader's network, with a share of their respective staking rewards accruing to the rsETH holders.","Restakers can then trade rsETH on decentralized exchanges, utilize rsETH on other DeFi applications and redeem the underlying assets at any time.","Despite the introduction of restaking solutions, selecting node operators on differing networks, complex reward structures involving various tokens, high transaction fees when claiming rewards, and the liquidity constraints of locked staked ether remain challenges and add risks, Stader noted.&nbsp;It argues rsETH addresses these issues by providing more straightforward access to restaking without the associated complexities.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234627\/eigenlayer-goes-live-on-ethereum-with-initial-17-million-deposit-limit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EigenLayer went live on Ethereum<\/a> in June with an initial $17 million deposit limit after raising <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222901\/eigenlayer-series-a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$50 million in Series A funding<\/a> in March.
