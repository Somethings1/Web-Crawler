They have many startup incubation schemes which are perfect for early-stage companies looking for a leg up,\" said Beauregard.","\"It's a strategic initiative to not only launch where our competition isn't but to domicile in a progressive country, where innovations like bitcoin are encouraged and not stymied by legal subpoenas from both state and federal levels struggling to understand what is evolving.\"","GoCoin plans to innovate in the bitcoin payment processing sector by opening its API and allowing eCommerce developers to fully integrate with it. In the spirit of open systems and the trust economy, GoCoin will keep \"no special powers\" and further provide a built-in reputation management system.","\"With bitcoin payments being final, we see the merchant rating system as critical to providing a fair gateway platform,\" Beauregard said.","The Singaporean bitcoin meetup he co-hosted last week was impressive in the number of attendees and, while it didn't have the \"big guns\" of the bitcoin ecosystem found at his Los Angeles gathering, he found the group had a passion and technological depth equivalent to those across the Pacific.","As a US citizen, Beauregard has been taken aback by international finance's newfound reluctance to deal with Americans. That reluctance has included both bitcoin exchanges and regular Asian banks.","\"I've now sent seven different ID documents to Mt. Gox and they still will not verify my account,\" he said. \"And the banks here in Singapore were quite open telling me to my face, 'We don't open accounts for American citizens.'\"","There's no guarantee that Singapore's own regulators will be any kinder to bitcoin in the long run. Indeed, just this week the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) warned bitcoin traders to \"be wary\" of the currency due to an inability to identify individuals behind transactions.","That warning sounds tame compared to other countries' pronouncements questioning bitcoin's very legality, however, and MAS has not yet announced any plans to regulate bitcoin.","In fact they have taken a more positive stance than their statement suggests, treating bitcoin like any closed virtual currency.","There is also the question of whether a jurisdiction so heavily associated with traditional financial services will embrace such a new form of currency or asset without any backlash.","Big government and big finance aside, the number of small traders accepting bitcoin in Singapore is growing thanks to its active IT sector.","GoCoin has signed up \"about a dozen\" merchants internationally for its initial private beta, mostly companies well familiar with bitcoin like mining hardware vendors, and also other hardware, software and gadget vendors.","\"They were some of the easiest software sales I've ever made, and I've been in this industry for 20 years,\" Beauregard said. \"We said 'minimal fees, no chargebacks,' and it was like 'where do I sign?'\"","Convincing other industries to jump on board may be as challenging as bringing the traditional financial sector into the bitcoin world.","\"It'll be a long grind I know, but I'd love to go after telcos, for that time in the future when you're all carrying bitcoin around on a mobile phone.\"","Feature image: gocoin.com"],"entity":[{"type":"April 2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Founder & CEO of GoCoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Steve Beauregard","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Unlike California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Los Angeles","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pacific","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"this week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$450 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"MAS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"summer","content":"DATE"},{"type":"GoCoin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Beauregard","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["GoCoin","Singapore","startups","News","Companies"],"authors":["Jon Southurst"]}
