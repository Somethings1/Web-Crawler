These meetings have prompted companies like Grayscale to adopt a creation and redemption model preferred by the SEC. This has resulted in issuers agreeing to disclose authorized participants in what the source described as an unusual step. Additionally, concerns regarding hard forks have also been addressed.<\/span>","In certain ETF structures, funds adhere to an \"in-kind\" redemption model, allowing investors to exchange shares for its underlying securities or commodities \u2014 typically to avoid tax penalties. In a cash model, the issuer must transfer the stored bitcoin and immediately sell it to provide cash. Companies like BlackRock have indicated their inclination towards adopting a cash model for their proposed spot bitcoin ETF, and Grayscale is the latest to follow suit.","\"The SEC asked everyone if you want to be in the first wave you have to be cash,\" the source said.","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Grayscale had been pushing for in-kind, but acquiesced to the SEC\u2019s desires, according to a source familiar. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In a meeting with the SEC ahead of the Christmas holiday, Grayscale argued it should offer both in-kind and cash create and redemption models. The U.S. ETF marketplace has 86 commodity ETFs, Grayscale said, of which 15 are \u201Ctrue, physically-backed commodity ETPs.\u201D All of those products have an in-kind redemption and creation model, it added.<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIn the 30-year history of the US ETP marketplace, all spot commodity ETPs have employed in-kind only primary market transactions,\u201D Grayscale said during the meeting, according to the source. \u201CCaution should be exercised before breaking with this convention, for the first time, as it relates to the approval of spot <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_positive\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      +1.05%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> ETPs.\u201D<\/span><\/span>","This argument did not persuade the agency to change its mind.

Notably, the Bitcoin network split into what's currently known as Bitcoin and another network known as Bitcoin Cash in 2017.","According to the source, discussions have revolved around establishing protocols to decide the course of action in the event of a fork. It has been agreed among issuers that trusts will relinquish any entitlements to a hard fork that diverges from the main chain, they said.","On Dec. 26, Grayscale amended its 3-S form to specify that its spot bitcoin ETF, if approved, would not receive any tokens through either a hard fork or an airdrop.","Exchanges have been busy meeting with the SEC this week as NYSE and Nasdaq met with the agency to discuss pending filings, according to two sources.","A person familiar with the matter said the SEC and Nasdaq met on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270181\/nasdaq-to-meet-with-sec-today-to-discuss-spot-bitcoin-etfs-source\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wednesday<\/a> to discuss a spot bitcoin ETF, among other topics.

They also couldn't comment on timing for when a spot bitcoin ETF would get the SEC's approval or disapproval.&nbsp;<\/span>","A high-placed executive at an issuer claimed that the notion of a spot ether ETF is still up in the air due to one overlooked reason.","The source said that the SEC's approval of futures-based bitcoin ETFs forced its hand to eventually approve a spot fund. This is because the agency disapproved previous proposals based on price manipulation, which issuers for a spot fund were able to address. It also provided a legal basis to fight for a spot fund, which was evident in Grayscale\u2019s fight with the SEC.","As for ETH, the SEC hasn\u2019t provided disapproval for such a fund and thereby has not back itself into a corner.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
