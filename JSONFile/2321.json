I grew up on a strict diet of cyberpunk scifi and it felt like something straight out of a Gibson or Sterling book\u2014I couldn\u2019t stop reading about how the protocol worked, how people were using it (shoutout SatoshiDice!) and what effects it might start to have on the global community.","Since then, as FinanceBros and other establishment critters descended on the space, a lot of what happened with Bitcoin was exciting to me an investor, but frankly boring as a child of the Neuromancer\/Snow Crash era of scifi.","In the course of exploring custody solutions for Primitive with Dovey, I learned about Shamir\u2019s secret sharing, an algorithm that allows you to take a secret string of text and split it into m pieces, of which n are required to reconstitute the original \u201Csecret.\u201D Invented by Adi Shamir (the \u201CS\u201D in \u201CRSA\u201D) in 1979, SSS is a time-tested piece of pretty simple cryptography, but it enables a lot of cool things. The more I played around with it, the more I wanted to use it as the basis for a game, an epic hunt for Bitcoin that would be spread around the world.","Long story short, we assembled an amazing team, and yesterday&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/email.mg2.substack.com\/c\/eJwlUMuOwyAM_JpyjDB5kQOHrdr9jYgGJ0VNIAKzVf5-nVbywdaMPeOZLOES02H2mEmUjGn0ziglda2EM40D3Wrh8zgnxM361VAqKPbyWP1kycdw8tuhFk_TN71Vg1aTBdDqIYdumkHJHpxt2tnxFmuMtjiPYUKDf5iOGFCs5km050v9c1G_XPT2RJiqKW48hUhLYjnMPGSyVM4GAHoNgwbZS6V71fad8EZJGGQDnQL2Lyuo5O1ag7x2907Wt0E1l0Zui6pyefCl6XVKiGQ2_8LKFWcz48v55Qf42KVjRxPwnVc8TQn6JsUBjMzZSvB0jBgsG3Tmu8KBNEPbSsEyLvK5YPYU4xznd0yvf_XtenE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/email.mg2.substack.com\/c\/eJwlUMuOwyAM_JpyjDB5kQOHrdr9jYgGJ0VNIAKzVf5-nVbywdaMPeOZLOES02H2mEmUjGn0ziglda2EM40D3Wrh8zgnxM361VAqKPbyWP1kycdw8tuhFk_TN71Vg1aTBdDqIYdumkHJHpxt2tnxFmuMtjiPYUKDf5iOGFCs5km050v9c1G_XPT2RJiqKW48hUhLYjnMPGSyVM4GAHoNgwbZS6V71fad8EZJGGQDnQL2Lyuo5O1ag7x2907Wt0E1l0Zui6pyefCl6XVKiGQ2_8LKFWcz48v55Qf42KVjRxPwnVc8TQn6JsUBjMzZSvB0jBgsG3Tmu8KBNEPbSsEyLvK5YPYU4xznd0yvf_XtenE&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1555665117772000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXPLOg8BNiu0od_YTeV3S8-Ri_Ww\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sent out the first clue<\/a>&nbsp;(via the Blockstream satellite, shoutout&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/email.mg2.substack.com\/c\/eJwlUMuugyAQ_ZqyNLy0smBxm_b-hkEYLVHBwHCNf3-xTWZzMmfOY6xBmGM69R4zkpIhDd5pzmkvOHFaOta3PfF5mBLAZvyqMRUgexlXbw36GC5-qwR5a6s4MAlC8ZYpdlcTFbbn0ty5HTuQHbk8BlOch2BBwx-kMwYgq34j7vkmfm78tw4eHhFSY-NWUYg4p2oHuQLiNadMUck6zmpG2rCGPh-C0Uf36qh4Ki5vkm4zb3IZMxq7XDIk6c0v0LjiTK77-WryWXwi4bmDDnDkFS5jgt9v1JJD5WwleDwHCKaGcPp7UktL1baUVBsXq1zQe4pxitMR0_IPHcly_g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/email.mg2.substack.com\/c\/eJwlUMuugyAQ_ZqyNLy0smBxm_b-hkEYLVHBwHCNf3-xTWZzMmfOY6xBmGM69R4zkpIhDd5pzmkvOHFaOta3PfF5mBLAZvyqMRUgexlXbw36GC5-qwR5a6s4MAlC8ZYpdlcTFbbn0ty5HTuQHbk8BlOch2BBwx-kMwYgq34j7vkmfm78tw4eHhFSY-NWUYg4p2oHuQLiNadMUck6zmpG2rCGPh-C0Uf36qh4Ki5vkm4zb3IZMxq7XDIk6c0v0LjiTK77-WryWXwi4bmDDnDkFS5jgt9v1JJD5WwleDwHCKaGcPp7UktL1baUVBsXq1zQe4pxitMR0_IPHcly_g&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1555665117773000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEj-invUCmLh7g8jrgyC3pZRAaBng\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@grubles<\/a>!) that kicked off a&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/email.mg2.substack.com\/c\/eJwlkEuOwyAQRE9jlhYf_1iwmCiZa1gY2jaKDRY0k_GcfnAi9a6qu-q10QhLiKc6QkKSE8TRWcU5HQQnVjWWDe1AXBrnCLBrtymMGciRp80ZjS74y99KQValpYV-5p1oGzlPAwUwHdWiB9nTdjADuTJGna0Db0DBD8QzeCCbWhGPSnxV_LtM0hjS6hJG0ClHqH_PP-IUp0zShnWclW60ZjW93wSjt-7RUXGXvKkaui-8TnlKqM2zNmEnUe3uCbXNVqeiLxfBW3hXwfMA5eGVNkCESPDzhQI3Fs-evcNzBK-nDaz6rBTYRrYtJSXGhnLOqyOGMIf5FeLzH6OUcZ0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=http:\/\/email.mg2.substack.com\/c\/eJwlkEuOwyAQRE9jlhYf_1iwmCiZa1gY2jaKDRY0k_GcfnAi9a6qu-q10QhLiKc6QkKSE8TRWcU5HQQnVjWWDe1AXBrnCLBrtymMGciRp80ZjS74y99KQValpYV-5p1oGzlPAwUwHdWiB9nTdjADuTJGna0Db0DBD8QzeCCbWhGPSnxV_LtM0hjS6hJG0ClHqH_PP-IUp0zShnWclW60ZjW93wSjt-7RUXGXvKkaui-8TnlKqM2zNmEnUe3uCbXNVqeiLxfBW3hXwfMA5eGVNkCESPDzhQI3Fs-evcNzBK-nDaz6rBTYRrYtJSXGhnLOqyOGMIf5FeLzH6OUcZ0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1555665117773000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfCF-yShqCqEAJubV1qrk1Dnkv4w\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">global hunt<\/a>&nbsp;for 1 million dollars in BTC.
