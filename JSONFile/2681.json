This is because they were the only people likely to have access to the liquidity in the pool; the hack happened very shortly after launch; it was an anonymous team and the team deleted all of the social media accounts and related websites moments after the event. As such, it's likely it was what's known as a \"rug pull\" \u2014 an event when a project's founders take all the money they can from their own project and abandon it.","The rug pull drained ether (ETH), looksrare (LOOKS), and USD Coin (USDC) tokens from the NFT exchange platform.

The platform\u2019s social media accounts and websites have also been taken offline, including its Medium blog page. There were several warnings on Twitter that SudoRare may be a scam project before the rug pull happened. Critics mostly pointed to the anonymous team as the reason for their suspicions.","SudoRare was supposed to be a combined fork of SudoSwap and LooksRare. Both are NFT marketplaces.
