Sources told The Block that Cheng would continue to operate as the CEO of Mysten Labs and that he is currently in conversations with both potential general partners and limited partners for the new fund.","\"There are a lot of web3 funds but [investors] are looking for something that\u2019s more not restricted to a particular ecosystem and that\u2019s very aligned with LPs, and also have the support of people who really, really fundamentally understand web3 technology and products,\" said Cheng on the podcast.","Cheng is one of those web3 tech experts.

All five of Mysten\u2019s founders worked on Meta\u2019s crypto initiatives.&nbsp;","Sui, Mysten Labs' Layer 1 blockchain, uses the Move programming language, which was developed at Meta. The blockchain has garnered significant interest from venture investors and raised a total of $336 million since late 2021, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/mysten-labs\/investor_financials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crunchbase data<\/a>. Yet it still hasn't launched and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/sui.io\/resources-sui\/testnet-wave-2-is-now-live\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">remains<\/a>&nbsp;in a testnet phase.","Cheng is adamant that if his venture capital plans come to fruition, they will not take the form of an ecosystem fund focused exclusively on the Sui blockchain.","\"This is going to be a fund that Mysten will be friendly with, but it\u2019s not a Mysten-only fund so to speak,\" said Cheng on the podcast.","\"From Mysten\u2019s perspective, this is also better aligned with LPs, as opposed to an ecosystem fund which tend to \u2018spray and pray,\u2019 almost like a grant program for anybody who wants to build on the platform,\" he said. \"So that\u2019s just a strategy we\u2019re pursuing.\"","Sui is just one of several chains competing for market share in an already crowded landscape of established blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche.
