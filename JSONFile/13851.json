Platforms like Uniswap have already made it possible for people to swap tokens freely. However, PointSwap is taking this a step further by integrating DeFi pricing models into e-commerce platforms, allowing for permissionless point swaps between brands. When a user swaps reward points from brand A for brand B, the points are first automatically swapped to PointSwap's platform token, which acts as a universal medium of exchange.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">New Medium Of Exchange Backed By Real-World Utility<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Just as Ethereum serves as the common medium of exchange in the world of DeFi, PointSwap's platform token will serve as the medium of exchange in the world of Web3 commerce. And once loyalty points can be easily exchanged with cryptocurrencies, the points become a more liquid asset while cryptocurrencies would gain an off-ramp into real-world commerce. PointSwap will be a crypto-to-real-world off-ramp and consumer portal to Web3.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">How DeFi Benefits Businesses And Consumers In The Real-World?<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The loyalty point exchange aims to create a win-win situation for consumers and brands issuing the reward points. When a user swaps reward points from one brand to another, both brands benefit. As the price of one reward point falls, it attracts cost-conscious consumers to buy the dip. And as the price of the other reward point rises, that brand gains new believers.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pointswap.cc\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">PointSwap<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> aims to create a strategic alliance among these brands in order to increase the use of reward points and drive new customer traffic.
