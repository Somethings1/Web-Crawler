This update will transition Starknet from using the costlier \"calldata\" method for data transactions to cost-efficient \"blobs\" transaction type, offering a direct path to fee reduction.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">These blob transactions, also called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/281258\/base-to-support-eip-4844-from-day-1-following-dencun-upgrade?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EIP-4844<\/a> (or proto-danksharding), are planned to go live on the Ethereum mainnet with the Dencun upgrade activated at epoch 269568 tomorrow at 13:55 UTC.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blobs will be an additive feature on the network, increasing data availability without impacting the existing Ethereum infrastructure, resulting in cheaper transactions across Layer 2 rollups such as Starknet.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMore than users on any other L2, they are expected to see Dencun directly cut fees. This is because Starknet fees have the highest proportion of Data Availability costs, where the savings are being made. But this is just the start,\u201D Diego Oliva, CEO of the Starknet Foundation, said.<\/span>","In addition to integrating EIP-4844, the Starknet Foundation plans to improve its shared prover (SHARP) infrastructure. For the uninitiated, STARK technology scales by producing a single proof for every block of transactions.","Instead of sending every block\u2019s proof to Ethereum, SHARP aggregates many proofs. Then, these are packed together in batches, known as \u201Ctrains.\u201D From this week and in a separate move, the size of these trains will gradually increase. In other words, the number of Starknet transactions that are jointly verified on Ethereum will rise, according to a statement.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
