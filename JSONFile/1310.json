The tools just haven't been made available to the public yet.","\"We are actively working to build and incorporate these types of tools into our creation pipeline for our community. We\u2019re not too far away from users being able to generate assets and entire worlds using AI inside Mona,\" he said.","AI-generated art is having a moment. While the technology is hardly new, it\u2019s only this year that generators usable by the average person have cropped up.","Generators like Stable Diffusion \u2014 whose database Mona is also using \u2014 and Midjourney work using \"prompts,\" which are text descriptions of the item users wish to create.&nbsp;","Examples of materials generated via Mona's tool. Source: Mona","The user bases for these tools are growing quickly. Midjourney launched its open beta in July this year and currently has over 3.2 million members on the Discord server where users submit their prompts.","Despite this growing audience, their use \u2014 particularly in the art world \u2014 is also controversial. Earlier this year, artist Jason M. Allen used Midjourney to create his winning entry for the Colorado State Fair\u2019s annual art competition in the emerging digital artists category. Despite making clear he had used the software, he faced severe backlash from other artists.","The creators of Mona believe that AI could play a pivotal role in how builders, architects and other users realize their visions in the metaverse. Building worlds on metaverse platforms is, after all, currently no easy feat.","\u201CImagine using AI to create your digital hangout space, home, or world. This is only the beginning of AI-human creative collaboration,\" co-founder and COO Matt Hoerl told The Block in an emailed statement.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
