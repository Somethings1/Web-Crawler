Specifically, the exploit was executed using an integer rounding issue, aided by a flash loan.","\u201CThe attacker took out a flash loan of a substantial amount of ETH, swapped it for PEPE, and donated it to a specific pool to manipulate the exchange rate. Subsequently, due to the so-called precision loss, the attacker was able to withdraw more of the underlying asset by burning fewer shares,\u201D Matthew Jiang, director of security services at BlockSec explained.","Jiang noted the attack was similar to the one carried out on <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hundred.finance\/15-04-23-hundred-finance-hack-post-mortem-d895b618cf33\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hundred Finance<\/a> last year.","This vulnerability originates from an older forked version of Compound V2, which Onyx incorporates into its underlying architecture.","The attacker has so far sent 700 ETH ($1.25 million) to the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x4c9c8661243e9e9a15a35b8873317eb881330c98\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on-chain data<\/a> shows.","Â© 2023 The Block.
