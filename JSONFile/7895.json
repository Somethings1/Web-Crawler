Tillemann is best known for his work in Washington, having worked for the White House and across U.S. Senate and Congressional campaigns, according to his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newamerica.org\/our-people\/tomicah-tillemann\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">biography<\/a>. He joined the State Department in 2009 as then served as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's speech writer.&nbsp;","Despite this change, he will maintain ties with Haun Ventures as an advisor, continuing to work with the firm's portfolio of companies through its Founder Advisory Network. For instance, Tillemann plans to conduct a founder day in D.C. early next year.","The firm disclosed three new members of this network to its portfolio founders. Joe Yum, formerly an FBI Special Agent, is joining the advisory network, boasting extensive experience leading investigations encompassing transnational organized crime, financial crime and national security threats. Ken Bagchi, another former special agent with the FBI, is joining the group after a two-decade career.&nbsp;","James Burnham, leveraging his background in supervising litigations of national importance for the government, recently advocated for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in support of Coinbase\u2019s lawsuit against the SEC, is also joining the group.","The inclusion of new policy-focused advisors within the venture firm's network coincides with specific legislators targeting the crypto market due to its close association with high-ranking figures in the national security realm.","Sen.

Letters were also sent to the Blockchain Association and Coinbase, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2023\/12\/19\/elizabeth-warren-cryptocurrency-washington-defense-00132409\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Politico<\/span><\/a>.&nbsp;<\/span>","Cryptocurrency companies have been bolstering their policy-focused teams and pouring resources into advocating for pro-crypto positions in Congress. Coinbase, most notably perhaps, launched a global advisory council to \"navigate the complex and evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency industry\" with members including former U.S. Senator Patrick Toomey, former congressman Tim Ryan, and former congressman Sean Patrick Maloney.&nbsp;","Still, Warren's assertions that cryptocurrencies are primarily used for illicit activities have been significantly challenged by industry participants and data.
