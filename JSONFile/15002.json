Investors will be able to mint and redeem OMMF on business days and collect interest daily in the form of new OMMF tokens, according to the company\u2019s blog post.","Read more: Ex-Goldman Sachs Traders Raise $4M for DeFi Risk Management Startup","Leading stablecoins such as Tether\u2019s USDT and Circle\u2019s USDC currently do not pay out interest to holders, even amid a rising-rate environment, because doing so would strengthen the case that such stablecoins are unregistered securities. Ondo says that\u2019s why the company is only targeting institutional investors designed as both accredited investors and qualified purchasers, a move that exempts Ondo from registering the product with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).","\u201CThere is no regulatory gray area with OMMF. We structured it as a security,\u201D Ondo Finance founder and CEO Nathan Allman told CoinDesk in an interview. \u201CStablecoins were not designed to be able to pay out interest in a way that is compatible with securities laws. They\u2019re a zero-interest rate phenomenon.\u201D","According to the project\u2019s website, OMMF lists an APY of 4.5%, in line with what publicly traded money market funds are currently yielding.","Stablecoins have also faced heat due to the fragility of their pegs. Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin UST collapsed in dramatic fashion last May, and even Circle\u2019s asset-backed stablecoin USDC depegged amid last month\u2019s Silicon Valley Bank crisis.","Read more: USDC's Depeg Laid Bare the Risks Traditional Finance Poses to Stablecoins","\u201CMoney market funds have a constant $1 NAV [net asset value],\u201D explained Allman. \u201CWe\u2019re also targeting holding a few percent of the fund\u2019s assets in stablecoins. That way, investors can get in and out.\u201D","Allman declined to give a specific launch date for Ondo\u2019s tokenized money market fund, saying it would go live \u201Csoon\u201D and that the company was currently \u201Cin the process of onboarding clients.\u201D","Security tokens like Ondo\u2019s OMMF have seen a surge in interest as startups and institutional investors alike are exploring ways to migrate traditional financial assets on-chain through tokenization. Crypto enthusiasts say innovations like smart contracts and blockchain technology can modernize outdated financial plumbing and democratize investing, but such innovations have also faced scrutiny by critics, who say such innovations are thinly-veiled attempts at skirting securities laws.","\u201CWe designed OMMF in a way that makes it composable with on-chain infrastructure,\u201D says Allman. \u201CBecause the token is composable with DeFi, you can lend against it permissionlessly.\u201D","Enter Flux Finance, a decentralized finance protocol backed by Ondo that functions as a permissionless touchpoint and, crucially, makes it accessible to retail investors. Allman says one way retail investors can access OMMF\u2019s yield without owning the security outright is by lending non-yield stablecoins like USDT and USDC into Flux, a protocol he describes as \u201Csimilar to Aave and Compound\u201D but without the overcollateralization. Then, whitelisted institutional clients can borrow the stablecoins in the Flux pool and mint OMMF, pocketing a small spread and paying out some yield to the protocol, which is passed onto retail investors.","\u201CIt\u2019s really just DeFi,\u201D added Allman. \u201CThis is what all of DeFi enables: the creation of financial services that are not operated by financial institutions.\u201D","Read more: Has Tokenization\u2019s Moment Finally Come?","Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."],"entity":[{"type":"Risks Traditional Finance Poses","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Allman","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nathan Allman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"US$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Allman","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"\u2019s Silicon Valley Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aoyon Ashraf","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Enter Flux Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sachs Traders Raise","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ondo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"last month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"DeFi Risk Management Startup","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ondo Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Stablecoins","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["DeFi","Stablecoin","USDT","USDC","Yield"],"authors":["Tracy Wang"]}
