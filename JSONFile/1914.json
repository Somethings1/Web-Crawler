This, in turn, would enable users to purchase cryptocurrencies with credit cards having base currency as JPY or CAD.","\u201CWe're not handling crypto directly ourselves but rather enable our partners to interact with the fiat world. We handle the fiat side of the purchase and our partners supply the crypto to the users,\u201D Simplex founder and CEO, Nimrod Lehavi, told The Block.","Simplex\u2019s addition of JPY and CAD doesn\u2019t mean its crypto clients will by default add support for the two currencies. \"Not all partners are going to add support for all currencies, but we see high demand for adding these and will roll out the service in the coming weeks with top exchanges,\u201D Lehavi told The Block, without disclosing names.","Simplex has already been supporting three fiat currencies on its platform - the U.S. dollar (USD), euro (EUR) and the British pound (GBP), said Lehavi, adding: \u201CCAD and JPY are just the first two currencies we are adding, with many more to come soon.\u201D","When asked for specific details, Lehavi said Simplex will add Russian rubles and Turkish lira \u201Cvery soon\u201D and will explore other \u201Chigh demand\u201D currencies as well during 2020.

When a Simplex user makes the purchase in his own card's base currency, like JPY for example, no forex fees will be added to the purchase, and simplex will handle the transaction,\u201D Lehavi told The Block.","Simplex is currently working with \u201Cover 120 partners globally.\u201D Besides Binance, Huobi and Poloniex, its crypto clients include OKCoin, KuCoin, Xapo, Ledger and Abra.","To date, Simplex has raised $18 million in funding, Lehavi told The Block, adding that the firm has an electronic money institution license in Lithuania, which is passported across the EU.","Headcount-wise, there are currently 100 people working for Simplex, said Lehavi, and that the firm is \u201Calways\" looking for more developers."],"hashtag":["BINANCE"]}
