Transaction fees within the network are based on the EIP-1559 design, which introduced a burn element to transaction fees on Ethereum. The difference is that Ethereum pays part of the transaction fee to validators and burns the rest, while Avalanche burns both.","The spike in burned fees is considerable. Between May 2022 and October 2023, only a few thousand AVAX would be burned each week, with a peak of 39,000 in one day in April 2023. At the end of November, there was a spike to 85,000 AVAX and then 40,000 AVAX two weeks later.
