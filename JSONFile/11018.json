It would still hold about 67% of the stake (12.2 million minus 4 million shares).","\"This is purely a judicious financial decision to realize some gains on Ripple's MGI [Moneygram International] investment and is in no way a reflection of the current state of our partnership,\" a Ripple spokesperson told The Block.","Indeed, the stock of MoneyGram has gone up in price since Ripple's initial investment. In June 2019, Ripple <a href=\"https:\/\/ir.moneygram.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/moneygram-announces-strategic-partnership-ripple\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bought the MoneyGram shares<\/a> at $4.10 apiece \u2014 representing a premium of about 183% at the time. The shares are currently trading at about $7.45 \u2014 i.e., a gain of about 80% on the initial investment.","\"We will remain a significant shareholder in MoneyGram following the sale \u2014 they are clearly a leader in the global payments space in over 200 countries and territories,\" said the spokesperson. \"In just over a year, we've made incredible progress and look forward to continuing to work alongside MoneyGram to transform cross-border payments.\"","The Block has reached out to MoneyGram for comments and will update this story should we hear back.","Ripple and MoneyGram <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/48383\/ripple-made-another-20m-investment-in-moneygram-to-complete-its-50m-commitment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">partnered<\/a> last year to leverage XRP in forex settlements as part of MoneyGram's cross-border payments business. As part of the deal, Ripple invested $50 million in MoneyGram. Their partnership agreement is scheduled to expire in July 2023.","Apart from the $50 million investment, Ripple also provides regular incentives to MoneyGram in XRP for leveraging the digital asset in remittance processes. So far, Ripple has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/83044\/ripple-moneygram-xrp-incentives-q3-2020\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shelled out<\/a> $52 million worth of incentives.","While MoneyGram receives these incentives in XRP, the company does not hold the digital asset. \"We sell XRP as soon as we receive it,\" a MoneyGram spokesperson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/58860\/we-sell-xrp-as-soon-as-we-receive-it-says-moneygram-on-ripple-incentive-payments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told The Block<\/a> earlier this year.","Â© 2023 The Block.
