It is widely used because it offers blocks that provide more value to validators. Yet, despite censorship and growing frustration from the Ethereum community, usage of Flashbots is only increasing.","According to Flashbots\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/transparency.flashbots.net\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Transparency Dashboard<\/a>, 39% of all Ethereum blocks are using Flashbots \u2014 including those proposed by other relays offering a similar service, or ones that haven't used a relay service. This is up from 12% on September 15.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">More validators are electing to process blocks proposed by Flashbots. Image: Flashbots Transparency Dashboard.<\/span>","The adoption of Flashbots has been rising because of its superior profitability. The service offers an average payout per block of 0.12 ETH ($147) to validators, compared to an average of 0.036 ETH ($44) from non-Flashbots blocks \u2014 a difference of 234%.","Currently,&nbsp;47% of validators are registered with Flashbots, which means they are integrated with its service and are able to use it.","While Flashbots offers a main relayer that censors transactions related to Tornado Cash, it has open-sourced its offering. It is possible to use alternative relayers that provide a similar service, though these do not necessarily offer the same rewards.","\u201CTo your other point we built mev-boost in such a way to maximize choice and competition: validators and users are empowered to choose which builders and relays they want to use,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bertcmiller\/status\/1575434028546670592\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">emphasized<\/a> Flashbots product lead Bert Miller,&nbsp;in response to criticisms of the service, on Twitter.&nbsp;","Yet, so far, this doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. Flashbots usage continues to rise, and some prominent Ethereum community members have called on Flashbots to shut its main relayer down \u2014 which would force validators to choose other providers.&nbsp;\u201CIf FlashBots truly cared about a credibly neutral Ethereum, they would shut down their relaying service TODAY,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/iamDCinvestor\/status\/1575568119656894464\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> well-known NFT investor DCinvestor on Twitter.","While Flashbots has been clear on its decision to censor transactions related to Tornado Cash, some believe it is an unnecessary move.&nbsp;In an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/layer2\/2022\/09\/28\/the-problem-tornado-cash-raises-about-base-layer-censorship-on-ethereum\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">opinion piece<\/a> for CoinDesk, two lawyers at crypto venture capital firm Paradigm \u2014 the main <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/flashbots\/pm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">capital partner<\/a> for Flashbots \u2014 argue that those running blockchain services have misinterpreted the sanctions placed on Tornado Cash.&nbsp;","\u201CBut the most pernicious result of the OFAC sanctions is they have the potential to be misinterpreted by \u201Cbase layer\u201D participants \u2013 which includes validators and other actors such as builders, pool operators, relays, searchers and sequencers \u2013 as requiring the censorship of blocks involving sanctioned addresses,\u201D the lawyers wrote, while noting that this is not the right way to interpret the law.&nbsp;","They added that the blockchain\u2019s base layer \u2014 the part that generates blocks and processes transactions \u2014&nbsp;isn\u2019t required to censor blocks involved in sanctioned transactions, in the same way that the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) underlying email isn\u2019t responsible for monitoring spam or illegal activity.","\u201CTo maintain its utility, crypto\u2019s base layer must also maintain its neutrality and lack of bias,\u201D they said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
