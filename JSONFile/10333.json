Other investors in the round include Lightshift and Chorus One. The capital raised will be used for hiring and expansion efforts.","Unlike contemporary bridging solutions, Union does not grant relayers special authority, ensuring private keys are not a target for security hacks, as they cannot take control of the protocol. Messages are verified using ZK proofs instead.","\u201CThe most prominent hacks are bridge hacks, yet bridges remain critical infrastructure for almost all projects, showing the need for better, more resilient products. It is our responsibility to innovate new ways to protect these assets and further the adoption of ZK technologies to realize a secure and interoperable cross-chain future,\u201D said Karel Kubat, founder of Union Labs.","Union\u2019s ZK bridge architecture includes two key components that enable the project to facilitate Cosmos\u2019 communication protocol, known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/article\/124659\/a-look-at-how-cosmos-is-enabling-swaps-between-blockchains\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IBC<\/a>, on Ethereum; CometBLS, the consensus mechanism, and Galois, the zero-knowledge prover system.","Union\u2019s CometBLS consensus allows the transfer of any asset natively to any chain without relying on third parties, oracles, or multi-signatures (multi-party computation). CometBLS augments Cosmos\u2019 Tendermint consensus, according to the team.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
