This is being touted as key for the scalability of Layer 2s on the network, offering them the capability to utilize increased data capacity.","Consequently, a major decrease in transaction costs on Ethereum Layer 2s is anticipated. \u201CThe overwhelming difference that users will notice with the EIP-4844 upgrade is that the transaction fees will be substantially reduced,\u201D Anthony Rose, head of engineering at Matter Labs \u2014 the core contributor to zkSync \u2014 told The Block.","zkSync, which functions as a Layer 2 network atop the Ethereum mainnet, aggregates hundreds to thousands of transactions into batches, which are then verified on the mainnet. However, this verification incurs fees, which are passed on to users.","At the time of writing, transaction fees on zkSync are averaging about $0.20. The component that EIP-4844 will affect \u2014 related to data costs \u2014 is roughly $0.08\u2013$0.10 per transaction. The team predicts that this data-related component could potentially reduce nearly ten-fold after Duncan, which may bring down the average fee (per transaction) to under $0.10.","Matter Labs has implemented code enhancements to zkSync in the past year, in line with EIP-4844, targeting performance and improving the capability to batch transactions and verify them.","\u201CWe\u2019re working on a number of improvements to the protocol that, combined with the changes specific to EIP-4844, will have a big impact on the performance of zkSync,\u201D Rose said.","Among them is the roll-out of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239880\/zksync-launches-new-proof-system-called-boojum-for-era-mainnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Boojum<\/a>, a STARK-based proof system designed to enable the network to compress and publish a lot more data to the mainnet within its batches.","Boojum was instrumental in the amount of data zkSync aggregates to Ethereum per Layer 2 batch, and now the cost efficiency that Duncan would bring would make it more cost-efficient.","\u201CWith the Boojum upgrade, we included some changes to the way we publish data to L1 (partly to prepare for EIP-4844), but this also allowed us to introduce better data compression, and simultaneously, we increased the L2 batch sizes,\u201D Rose explained.","\u201COur batches will be bigger, and the transactions will get cheaper,\u201D he added.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
