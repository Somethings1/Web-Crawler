Prosecutors, led by U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams, have also decided not to pursue a charge of unlawful political donations that was severed from the original indictment due to a dispute with the Bahamas over Bankman-Fried's extradition.&nbsp;","In a letter explaining the decision, prosecutors noted that evidence concerning several of the charges was already presented during Bankman-Fried's original trial, in which he was found guilty on all seven counts of fraud and conspiracy related to his leadership of FTX and its sister trading firm, Alameda Research. That evidence may be considered at sentencing, even though a jury was never given a chance to weigt in, the prosecutors explain.&nbsp;","\"Proceeding with sentencing in March 2024 without the delay that would be caused by a second trial would advance the public\u2019s interest in a timely and just resolution of the case,\" the prosecutors <a href=\"https:\/\/storage.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940\/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.388.0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a>.&nbsp;","As such, certain information may never come to light, like exactly how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/256063\/sbf-tried-thai-sex-worker-wallets-to-unlock-frozen-funds-before-bribing-official-witness-claims\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thai sex workers<\/a> figured in to Alameda's plan to unfreeze its Chinese accounts, a situation that ultimately resulted in Alameda paying a bribe to Chinese government officials, according to the testimony of star witness and former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison.&nbsp;","However, the crypto community seems largely concerned with one dropped charge in particular: the charge of unlawful political donations, given Bankman-Fried's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/184820\/sam-bankman-fried-goes-from-toast-of-washington-to-political-pariah\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">well-publicized donations<\/a> to large numbers of both Democratic and Republican politicians.
