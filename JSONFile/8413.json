It also reduces the need to invest in rapidly depreciating equipment, allowing miners or other participants to add or reduce their Bitcoin hashpower dynamically. Another use case would enable miners in low-cost electricity areas to arbitrage their cheaper Bitcoin mining production by selling their hashpower at global market rates.","The decentralized data routing protocol project said the decision to select Arbitrum for its hashpower marketplace came down to user experience, faster transactions and reduced gas fee benefits, making Bitcoin hashrate trading more liquid and accessible.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lumerin hashpower marketplace.

This has fueled centralization fears, with Foundry and AntPool currently accounting for more than 50% of the network's total hashpower combined.","However, when the proportion of miners connecting to a particular pool has risen too high in the past, miners have voluntarily pointed their hashpower to alternative pools, improving the distribution.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin mining pool distribution.
