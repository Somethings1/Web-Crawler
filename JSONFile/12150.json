These filings are likely the result of many conversations and a lot of man hours on\/between both sides.\"","The updated BlackRock filing included new language about efforts the trust administrator will take to monitor for unusual price movements. It also added language about anti-money laundering compliance and included an audited statement from PricewaterhouseCoopers.","\"The Sponsor and the Trust will only interact with known third-party service providers with respect to whom the Sponsor or its affiliates have engaged in a due diligence process to ensure a thorough KYC process, such as the Authorized Participants, Market Makers, Prime Broker and Bitcoin Custodian,\" the updated filing read.","Bitcoin has surged amid speculation that the SEC could be getting ready to finally approve a spot fund.
