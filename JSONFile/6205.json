It is a somewhat contradictory thought: that an algorithm that spits out random patterns could be primed to produce more grails. More to the point, if it accomplished this, would those more commonplace pieces still be considered grails? In the case of QQL, more than any other collection, time will tell.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The focus on grail production also begs the question: What inspired Hobbs and Dandelion to create QQL?
