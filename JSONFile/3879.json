Notably, this comes after Inverse Finance had become a target of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/140318\/defi-protocol-inverse-finance-suffers-exploit-loss-of-15-million-in-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$15 million exploit<\/a> in April.","In today's incident, an unknown perpetrator executed a flash loan attack using 27,000 wrapped bitcoin (worth about $579 million) at around 4:47 a.m. ET, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0x958236266991bc3fe3b77feaacea120f172c0708ad01c7a715b255f218f9313c\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on-chain data<\/a>.

It is greatly facilitated by the flashloan to skew the reserves in the pool,\" PeckShield <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/peckshield\/status\/1537382891230883841\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>.","To update its community, Inverse <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InverseFinance\/status\/1537372199769845760\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> in a Twitter post that it has temporarily paused borrows and was still investigating.","Â© 2023 The Block.
