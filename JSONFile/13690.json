Image: JPMorgan.<\/span>","The fall in Ethereum activity suggests that various \"bearish forces\" of the last year, including the FTX and Terra collapses, U.S. regulatory uncertainty and crackdown, the fading of interest in crypto by institutional investors and the drying up of venture capital funding, may have outweighed the positive impact of the Shanghai upgrade on Ethereum's network activity, according to the analysts. The Shanghai upgrade allowed Ethereum validators to withdraw the staked ether that has been locked in the network.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moreover, Ethereum Layer 2 networks have displayed mixed results, they said.

However, \"continued bearish crypto forces remain a headwind,\" the analysts said.","Protodanksharding is a preliminary step towards the full implementation of danksharding, which differs from the initially planned sharding technique. Instead of splitting the Ethereum blockchain into multiple shard chains, Danksharding introduces data-containing blobs \u2014 temporary data packets attached to blocks that can hold more data than the blocks themselves.","This innovation is expected to benefit Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, which bundle transactions before posting them back to the main chain. The data blobs will not alter the Ethereum block size but will create additional temporary data space for Layer 2 rollups, potentially increasing network throughput and reducing transaction fees.","Protodanksharding is currently scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year, but this may be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252476\/ethereum-dencun-upgrade\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">delayed to early next year<\/a>.","Â© 2023 The Block.
