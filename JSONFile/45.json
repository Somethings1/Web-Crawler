However, the prosecution still claims that what Eisenberg did, from alleged market manipulation to stealing funds, was fraudulent, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/innercitypress\/status\/1777689619523309593\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reports<\/a> from Inner City Press.","In opening statements, Assistant US Attorney Tian Huang said Eisenberg artificially pumped up the price of MANGO, stole funds, disguised himself as a Ukrainian woman, fled the country and ultimately \"conned Mango Markets.\"","\"At the end, what that man did boils down to something far older: plain fraud,\" Huang added.","Eisenberg's defense impinges on claiming the trades were legitimate within the decentralized finance system he executed them in.","\"Every trade has a winning side, and every trade has a losing side. It is not illegal to win, to execute a trade that is to your benefit,\" said Eisenberg's defense lawyer Sanford Talkin. \"He does not deny he did these trades. He does not deny he made a profit. But he denies he committed a crime, because he did not. He executed a winning trading strategy. He is not guilty.\"","Mango Markets is a Solana-based decentralized finance protocol providing borrowing, lending and other financial services. In early October 2022, a hacker artificially pumped up the price of MANGO, the platform's native token, and exploited the protocol through a bad debt position. This is when a borrower takes funds that they will not or cannot pay back, leaving the lender \u2014 Mango Markets \u2014 in the hole.","Specifically, the exploiter put $5 million worth of the stablecoin USDC into Mango Markets and then opened a remarkably large long position, which caused MANGO's price to jump around 1,000% within an hour. The surge in MANGO's price caused the exploiter's collateral value to rise. The exploiter then borrowed other tokens on Mango Markets to accrue a large debt position before making off with the funds, The Block previously reported.","In all, Mango Markets lost around <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/176445\/hacker-steals-over-100-million-from-mango-markets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$116 million<\/a> worth of funds in the exploit.","Eisenberg took <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177424\/mango-markets-exploiter-comes-clean-claims-all-actions-were-legal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">responsibility<\/a> a few days after the incident, stating that his actions were part of a legal \"highly profitable\" trading strategy that used Mango Markets as it was designed. He returned $67 million in stolen funds back to Mango Markets, and the protocol's community allowed him to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177736\/mango-markets-proposes-plan-to-pay-back-victims-after-114-million-hack\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">keep<\/a> $47 million in a governance vote.","However, the United States agencies didn't buy Eisenberg's claims of legality.
