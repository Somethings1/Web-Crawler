The update is designed to halve the parachain block time from 12 seconds to 6 seconds and augment the block space for each block by 5-10 times.&nbsp;","\"Asynchronous backing enables flexible scheduling for our future scaling work through elastic scaling and instantaneous coretime.

The design is there \u2014 we know how to scale Polkadot for the indefinite future,\u201D Parity Engineering Lead Sophia Gold said in a statement.","A release of asynchronous backing is set to be deployed to Polkadot\u2019s Rococo testnet in about two weeks, Parity Technologies, a leading contributor to Polkadot, said at the sub0 developer conference in Lisbon.
