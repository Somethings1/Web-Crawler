The change is to merge the beacon chain run by PoS with the original chain run by PoW and gradually stop the PoW part of the original chain. This upgrade represents a switch for Ethereum to PoS consensus in the near future. This is a key step in Ethereum's journey to 2.0, and it has attracted much attention because it involves the transformation of public chain consensus. Among them, the miners are most concerned because it is highly related to their vital interests.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Caduceus CTO Matt said, ' The Metaverse demands high-quality computing power to support creation, production and interaction.
