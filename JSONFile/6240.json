MicroStrategy is based in Tysons Corner, Va.&nbsp;","\u201CDefendant Saylor knowingly avoided income taxes he owed to the District by fraudulently claiming to be a resident of other, lower-tax jurisdictions while maintaining his domicile and place of abode in the District, including living in a luxury penthouse the Georgetown waterfront and docking multiple yachts on the District\u2019s Potomac riverfront from 2005 to present,\u201D the complaint filed Aug. 22 but made public on Aug. 31 by Racine alleges.
