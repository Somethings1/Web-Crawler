They\u2019d already minted and created these tokens. \u2026 It\u2019s a fascinating demonstration of how to do social protests using blockchain technology.\u201D ","","","The DADA Collective\u2019s Judy Mam said 10 artists contributed to this piece to support Black Lives Matter and police reform, with pictures of 30 officers along with their alleged crimes and case statuses. ","","","The artists leveraged Arweave\u2019s blockchain to create a wallet associated with each person killed, holding tokens that have data for the corresponding officers\u2019 information. ","","","\u201CThe private keys of the wallets that control these tokens have been destroyed. No one controls these tokens. These tokens can\u2019t be censored, modified or taken down,\u201D the project\u2019s website says. ","","","\u201CBlockchain is itself a political statement, the ability to organize outside of government control,\u201D Bertam said. \u201CWhat about decentralizing justice or human rights or other aspects of society that are critical to the ways people live?\u201D","","","And yet, this project raises tricky questions about the ethics of immutable digital records. In Europe, lawmakers have introduced a \"right to be forgotten\" with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Even in the United States, Mam said the artists behind this project prefer to stay anonymous because some jurisdictions limit access to evidence that might incriminate police officers.","","","\u201CThe police do take action against [outspoken] people,\u201D Mam said. \u201CThese [visual pieces] are tokenized but they\u2019re not for sale. \u2026 It was about making a statement.\u201D ","","","With simple text beneath black and white photos, the message is clear. There\u2019s scant artistic flourish in this piece. ","","","\u201CWe don\u2019t forget. We find out who you are,\u201D Mam said. \u201CMaybe someday some of these men will get a [prison] sentence. \u2026 But at least now there\u2019s a record that is there forever, immutably, of these people and their crimes.\u201D","","","The criminal justice system failed to proceed with formal charges in most of these cases, despite community efforts, according to research from Bowling Green State University. This piece is just one of many activist projects already curating public lists with such information. Howard University student and crypto aficionado Gerald Nash, who was not affiliated with the \u201CNo Justice No Peace,\u201D said he thinks the project is interesting. ","","","\u201CPeople should take into account this isn\u2019t an organization doing unbiased research,\u201D Nash said of the art collective. \u201CAs a black person and someone who wants to see justice. ... I see no difference between this and holding up a sign.\u201D ","","","Of course, \u201Ccensorship resistance\u201D is a relative term. Governments could make it difficult to access affiliated websites and keyword searches, even if the blockchain data remains unaltered. Some experts would also argue a blockchain\u2019s immutability depends on its incentive structure and participants, which likely are not infallible. The Arweave blockchain\u2019s distribution is still nascent, with less than 3,000 members in the project\u2019s Discord group.","","","Even with these limitations, University of New Hampshire law professor Tonya Evans agreed this art project is an interesting use case \u2013 memorializing information.","","","\u201CI would compare it to what news reporters do \u2026 [but] reporters have to be very thoughtful about ways to correct the record, even if that\u2019s to add to and not take away from,\u201D Evans said, describing American freedom of speech laws. \u201CCode is also speech. It will be interesting to see what type of innovation emerges during this period with regards to protecting free speech.\u201D",""],"entity":[{"type":"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bowling Green State University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"University of New Hampshire","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bertram","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Howard University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 6","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Judy Mam","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tonya Evans","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gerald Nash","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nash","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mintbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DADA Collective","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dennison Bertram","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Black Lives Matter","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bertam","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mam","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Evans","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Art","Blockchain","NFTs","Activists","Arweave","Black Lives Matter","Policy Brutality","free speech"],"authors":["Leigh Cuen"]}
