The stars have aligned.\u201D","To lead the U.S. front, it has hired Rob Catalanello \u2014 an electrical engineer turned e-commerce guru, who served on New York's Federal Reserve FX Market Committee for nine years.","\u201CI was very impressed by B2C2\u2019s tech, and its business model,\u201D Catalanello said in a joint-interview, explaining his decision to head its U.S. branch, which will be based in Jersey City.","The firm will initially focus on cash trading against the U.S. dollar, targeting wholesale institutional investors primarily, but did not rule out eventually introducing its main product of derivatives trading.","\u201CWe\u2019re not going to cut corners. FINRA, CFTC [regulatory bodies] \u2013 those things are in play\u2026But we want to make a success of cash trading in the U.S., and we\u2019ll follow demand if we need to start offering different products,\u201D Boonen said.","The firm recently surpassed its one-millionth electronic OTC trade in just over three years of operating.","\u201CI\u2019m very optimistic based on the early response,\u201D Catalanello said, noting that B2C2\u2019s \u201Ctechnological leadership\u201D and institutional-geared customer service would help differentiate it in the US OTC market, which is currently dominated by Circle and Cumberland.","Elsewhere, desks appear to be facing more headwinds in terms of&nbsp; being able to keep on their Wall Street talent. CMT Digital, a Chicago-based firm, laid off more than 10 people from its OTC team, as The Block previously reported. Kenetic Capital, another firm, shut its advisory and over-the-counter trading business.","At Cumberland, a Chicago-based crypto OTC firm, the global head of business development is preparing to leave at the end of the month, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/03\/20\/cumberlands-business-development-head-james-radecki-set-to-depart-firm\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as The Block reported earlier this week<\/a>.","Â© 2023 The Block.
