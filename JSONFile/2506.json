This gives these tokens a diluted market cap of $21 million at a price of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/search_redirect?id=kelp-earned-points&amp;type=coin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$0.14 per token<\/a>.","This development occurs within the context of growing interest in liquid restaking, where the total value locked across leading platforms has surpassed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278135\/liquid-restaking-protocols-tvl-3b#:~:text=The%20total%20value%20locked%20in%20liquid%20restaking%20tolens%20has%20surpassed,deposits%20over%20the%20last%20month.\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$4 billion<\/a>.

This can then be used to secure other protocols, though this feature is yet to go live. This is referred to as restaking.","Meanwhile, the idea behind liquid restaking offered by Kelp (and others such as EtherFi and Renzo) is that it allows ETH holders \u2014 holding either native or sometimes LST tokens \u2014 to invest and restake on Eigen without losing access to the underlying capital. (Hence the term \u201Cliquid.\u201D)","Users of EigenLayer earn points for their ether deposits, which are said to increase their odds of receiving a token from EigenLayer. Users of liquid restaking keep their capital liquid while also retaining their Eigen points.","Kelp has converted these points into a token, opening up its separate on-chain market and a brand new cryptocurrency niche. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/277823\/crypto-projects-115b-points\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Other avenues for trading points<\/a> exist, like Whales Market and Pendle, but they have yet to convert points into tokens.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
