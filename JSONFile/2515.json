It has since become the&nbsp;primary site for accessing Augur's market data, although it does not itself facilitate trades.","Meanwhile, Veil launched its Augur-based trading platform earlier this month, offering a more streamlined interface which eliminates the need to download the Augur app and sync it to Ethereum\u2019s network.&nbsp;Its goal is to make Augur mainstream,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/01\/10\/veil-wants-to-make-decentralized-financial-products-frictionless-for-mainstream-users\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> its founders recently told The Block.<\/a>","[related id=\"1\"]","By acquiring Predictions.Global, whose profile and brand is more established than Veil's, the platform wants to become \"the easiest way to discover Augur markets,\" as well as the easiest way to trade, Fletcher-Hill told The&nbsp;Block.&nbsp;He added that the Predictions.Global&nbsp;site&nbsp;would stay as it is for now, beyond \"adding links into Veil.\" He&nbsp;noted that Predictions.Global's&nbsp;cofounder&nbsp;Jorge Olivero&nbsp;would not be joining Veil while Ryan Berckmans&nbsp;would be contracted as a software advisor.","Veil did not disclose the price of the acquisition but said they were not currently pursuing any others. The company raised a fundraising round in the single-digit millions last year.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
