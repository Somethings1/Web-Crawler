They were all charged by the DOJ with two counts of wire fraud conspiracy and two counts of wire fraud.","The SEC charged the three with violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.","Â© 2023 The Block.
