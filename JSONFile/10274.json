The seller goes by \"oscuranft\" on OpenSea, who booked a profit of about $600,000 having bought the NFT a week ago for 100 ETH.","Moonbirds is an NFT collection of 10,000 owl avatars. It is one of the fastest collections to reach bluechip status in terms of floor price. Moonbirds was launched on April 16 by Proof, a media startup founded by renowned venture capitalist Kevin Rose.&nbsp;","Rose is currently a partner at the technology-focused venture capital firm True Ventures. He was previously a general partner at Google Ventures and has over 1.5 million Twitter followers.","Rose hosts an NFT-focused podcast via Proof. Moonbirds is his second big NFT project after Proof Collective \u2014 a private group of 1,000 NFT collectors and artists, including Beeple, who hold a Proof Collective NFT and get certain exclusive benefits.","These benefits include access to Proof\u2019s private Discord, early access to the Proof podcast and in-person events.","Moonbirds are \"the official Proof PFP\" (picture for proof or profile pic) of the Proof Collective, according to the Moonbirds website.&nbsp;","Moonbirds NFTs have clocked in a total sales volume of nearly $360 million in just over a week, according to The Block Research, citing data from Dune Analytics.

That means holders are sitting on gains of over 12 times in just over a week.&nbsp;","According to The Block Research's NFT analyst, Thomas Bialek, Moonbirds' quick success has been driven by several factors: backing from Rose; the success of his previous Proof Collective project; and collectors currently opting for NFT projects with a successful track record.","Proof Collective NFT holders are also sitting on bigs gains. These NFTs were minted last December starting at a price of 5 ETH via a Dutch auction. The current <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/proof-collective\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">floor price<\/a> of these NFTs is 109 ETH, according to OpenSea.&nbsp;","Proof Collective NFTs have clocked in a total sales volume of over $39 million to date, according to The Block Research, citing data from Dune Analytics.&nbsp;","As for Moonbirds, Rose appears to have bigger plans.
