The DAO was built on Uniswap\u2019s protocol, utilizes Aragon to make governance proposals, and uses OpenZeppelin to deploy smart contracts.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Since its launch in December 2019, the price of a single FAME token \u2013 relative to one Genesis Shirt \u2013 has risen from $8 to $402, with 79 of the 100 limited-edition Genesis Shirts already sold at the time of writing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The new platform, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ourzora.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Zora<\/a>, is essentially an online marketplace where all brands and creators can copy Saint Fame\u2019s strategy. The pitch, according to <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the project\u2019s creator Jacob Horne, is to allow brands to capture their products\u2019 resale value.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI like to describe the problem as the Yeezy problem,\u201D he said. \u201CWhen Kanye sells a pair of Yeezy, he sells them at a flat rate of $200. Then a whole bunch of professionals wait in line hours to buy them and immediately resell them for $2000. Kanye and Adidas don\u2019t get any of that extra revenue they could\u2019ve captured themselves.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With Zora, on the other hand, brands generate revenues based on their products\u2019 real-world demand. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">All items will be tokenized and sold on a bonding curve. On the brand-creation <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">side, up-and-coming brands can use the platform to engage the community in the early stages and garner excitement around a new product before it even exists. On the speculative side, people can purchase fractions of an item to trade on secondary markets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSaint Fame was a happy experiment that blew up more than we ever could have expected,\u201D said Horne. \u201CWe got a lot of inbound interest from brands and musicians who wanted to do the same thing.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe'd like to use Saint Fame as the first brand and customer of Zora,\u201D he said. \u201CEventually, our goal is building out Zora to help anyone in the world create their own \u2018Saint Fame.\u2019\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The platform does not yet have a clear revenue model. Horne said it would be either a percentage of revenue generated from the token or a fee in the token itself. Zora also does not have a community-based governance structure, but the team is exploring ways to do so, including potentially launching a platform token.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Its 2020 goal, according to Horne, is to onboard 100 high-quality brands and continue to educate the broader population about the concept of DAOs. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Horne had been a product manager at Coinbase for over three years (he recently resigned from his post to focus on Zora). On Nov. 11, 2019, he found himself with a full day off for Veterans Day and decided to test out an idea he'd had for a long time.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He called up a designer friend. They started with a simple Twitter profile with a description of the idea \u2013 an Internet-owned fashion house \u2013 and finished building the DAO that same day, expecting little to happen.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe shipped it at around 1:30 a.m. I put out one tweet, expecting nothing to happen,\u201D he recalled. \u201CI woke up in the morning and it had done over $10,000 in volume already.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the time when Horne launched the FAME token, he did not even know how the shirt was going to look. The only information they put out was that the shirt would be designed by Matthew Vernon, nicknamed \u201CDapp Boi.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe love the Unisocks project and thought \u2018how can we push this one step further?\u2019\u201D he said. \u201CSo, we decided to launch before we even know what the design of the shirt was going to be.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the weeks that followed, Horne watched the price surge and the demand increase. Before the design was even announced, one FAME token was already worth more than $200 and the volume reached nearly $20,000.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When Vernon finally submitted his work, the DAO \u2013 consisting of around ten members \u2013 voted to approve it. Curiously, the price dropped back to $80 before slowing climbing up to its current value.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe were literally seeing the hype cycle play out,\u201D Horne said. \u201CSo we've spent the past couple of months getting the highest possible quality shirts made. We got some amazing packaging and we're hoping to enable redemption in the next week or so.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Though taking heavy inspiration from Unisocks, Saint Fame tried to improve upon the latter by letting the DAO create and own the FAME tokens itself. According to Horn, it was the first DAO to actually create an exchange directly on Uniswap and add liquidity to it.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As the Genesis Shirt is almost ready for redemption, Horne confirmed that the fashion house has more products in the works. \u201CStay tuned,\u201D he said.<\/span>"],"hashtag":["COINBASE"]}
