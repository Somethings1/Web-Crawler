The case was brought by investors who lost money when the price of dogecoin collapsed between 2019 and 2021, after Musk appeared to stop supporting the memecoin. During that period, Musk made many supportive tweets of the coin. But in May 2021, he appeared on Saturday Night Live and called dogecoin \u201Ca hustle\u201D.","The dogecoin price plummeted, wiping out $86 billion in value as a result, the suit claims.","Although Musk had been named personally as a defendant Twitter itself has not yet been sued. But in October, Musk acquired Twitter and named himself as chief executive officer. In early April, he changed Twitter\u2019s logo for that of a shiba inu dog \u2014 the icon of dogecoin. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/224621\/dogecoin-skyrockets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The price of DOGE rallied 30%<\/a> before collapsing again a few days later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/225328\/dogecoin-dives\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">when Musk reverted the logo back to the blue bird<\/a>.","The Block asked lawyers on both sides if Musk\u2019s recent antics would complicate the pre-existing lawsuit. Lawyers for Musk and Tesla did not respond.","Perhaps unsurprisingly, Evan Spencer, who represents the investors who claim they lost money on dogecoin due to Musk\u2019s manipulation of its price, said he believed Musk\u2019s logo change could drag Twitter into the case.","\u201CAfter reviewing Defendants motions to dismiss we are more confident than ever that we will prevail in this case,\u201D he told the Block. \u201COur opposition&nbsp;brief&nbsp;will be filed within 60 days.&nbsp;After the court rules in our favor, we will be filing a motion to add Twitter as a Defendant.\u201D","He declined further comment.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Related stories:<\/strong>","Â© 2023 The Block.
