The announcement included support for EU enterprises with a program called the Partnership on Virtual Worlds under Horizon Europe. The program is focused on fostering \"an industrial and technological roadmap for virtual worlds.\u201D","The statement also described two new web4 public authority initiatives: An immersive urban environment, called CitiVerse, used for city planning and management, and the European Virtual Human Twin, for modeling clinical decisions and personal treatment.","Other initiatives for helping public authorities make informed policy decisions include Destination Earth, and Local Digital Twins for smart communities. \"The Web 4.0 and virtual worlds will bring benefits for health, contribute to the green transition and better anticipate natural disasters,\" Margrethe Vestager of Europe Fit for the Digital Age said.","The bloc is concerned that its domestic technology will be outpaced by developments in the U.S. and China. A report linked to the statement highlighted U.S. companies working on metaverse technology including Meta, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. It also pointed to developments in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239063\/bank-of-china-tests-sim-card-nfc-payments-for-digital-yuan\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">China<\/a>, with Alibaba, Baidu, NetEase and Bytedance progressing their metaverse strategies.","\u201CContrary to these countries, in the EU there are no tech giants to lead the investment in the development of virtual worlds over the next decade. However, the EU is strong in research and innovation for middleware and software,\u201D the report said.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
