He noted an uptick in Capriole's Bitcoin Miner Sell Pressure, which indicates that BTC miners are selling a bigger part of their revenues than on average.","Read more: Bitcoin Mining Stocks Rally as BTC Holds Above $30K Despite Looming Halving Concerns","Despite the short-term consolidation, Edwards suggests bitcoin could target the $40,000-$45,000 range in the coming weeks as the sell pressure subsides.","\"While price may temporarily stall here at monthly resistance, the next significant trouble area is low- to mid-$40Ks,\" he said. \"We expect bitcoin will take us there in short order given the data on hand.\"","The largest crypto by market capitalization also topped at around $35,000 on Monday, hitting a 17-month high as anticipation for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund \u2013 coupled with some other catalysts \u2013 hit a fever pitch. Despite stories about imminent approval for a spot ETF turning out to be mistaken, bitcoin has retreated only modestly from that level.","While bitcoin pulled back nearly 2% following the run to $35,000, it remains higher by 1.6% over the past 24 hours. That\u2019s a sizable outperformance over U.S. stocks, where the Nasdaq is lower by 2.4% and the S&P 500 by 1.4% early Wednesday afternoon.","The renewed tumble in stocks came alongside a sharp 13 basis point rise in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.95%. Also on investor minds were poor Q3 earnings results from Google (down 9% today) and rising geopolitical worries.","Earlier Wednesday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Hamas was not a terrorist organization and canceled a planned trip to Israel. Shares in Istanbul closed 7% lower.","Edited by Stephen Alpher."],"entity":[{"type":"Charles Edwards","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin Miner Sell Pressure","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Hamas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Capriole Investments","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Israel","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"4.95%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"afternoon","content":"TIME"},{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$35,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Stephen Alpher","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"9%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2.4%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Tayyip Erdogan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Edwards","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Mining Stocks Rally as BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$45,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Capriole","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Istanbul","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$40,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$30K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$40Ks","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Markets","Bitcoin","btc price","Capriole Investments","Bitcoin Miners","Market Wrap"],"authors":["Krisztian Sandor"]}
