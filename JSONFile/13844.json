He also agreed to pay a $50 million fine and step down as CEO as part of the plea deal.&nbsp;","The U.S. Department of Justice <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264010\/justice-department-set-to-announce-settlement-with-binance-bloomberg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">settled<\/a> the connected criminal case with Binance, which probed into alleged money laundering, fraud and sanctions violations. The crypto exchange will pay a $4.3 billion fine, marking one of the largest corporate settlements in U.S. history.","Teng previously worked as Binance\u2019s Global Head of Regional Markets. He also has extensive regulatory experience, serving as the CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market, chief regulatory officer at the SGX and spending 13 years at financial watchdog the Monetary Authority of Singapore.","In the blog post, Teng wrote that Binance remained committed to bringing value to its users and deliver products. The company\u2019s fundamentals remain \u201Cvery strong,\u201D Teng asserted, noting that it continues to operate the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. \u201CYou should feel confident in the financial strength, security and safety of the company,\u201D he said.","Teng also noted Binance\u2019s proof of reserves system and 1:1 backing for user assets. However, many have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/187240\/exchanges-rushed-to-show-proof-of-reserves-its-not-enough\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">criticized<\/a> these measures which fail to reveal audited fiat reserves, client and company liabilities and other information to assess a firm\u2019s financial health. Teng also declined to provide specifics on this in an <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/crypto\/2023\/11\/27\/new-binance-ceo-richard-teng-board-financial-disclosures\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interview<\/a> with Fortune published today but said he has a \u201Crobust timeline\u201D for it.","Binance had \u201Cturned the page\u201D on its historical challenges, Teng added, addressing prior compliance issues by recruiting the right personnel to revamp its compliance program and culture.","With a renewed focus on collaborating with policymakers, and working with peers across the crypto industry, Teng said Binance can \u201Ccontribute to the development of a globally harmonized regulatory framework that will foster innovation while providing critical consumer protections.\u201D","It remains to be seen if Binance\u2019s users will be convinced by Teng\u2019s statements, with the exchange seeing over $1 billion in outflows since the DOJ settlement and its market share among non-USD exchanges slipping below 45% from 70% at the start of the year amid its regulatory issues, according to The Block\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/no-usd-support-exchange-volume-market-share\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data dashboard<\/a>.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/no-usd-support-exchange-volume-market-share\/embed\" title=\"No USD Support Exchange Volume Market Share\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Beyond the centralized Binance exchange, Teng added he intended to help drive the adoption of web3 and decentralized applications.","\u201CAs we usher in the next phase of Binance\u2019s responsible growth, I am excited for the opportunity to engage in a meaningful conversation with global policymakers, to ensure crypto investors remain confident in the industry\u2019s future and to engage and educate the next billion users so that we may work to ensure the long-term sustainability of crypto,\u201D Teng said.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
