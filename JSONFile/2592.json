SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said most cryptocurrencies are securities and should be regulated similarly to other investments. The crypto industry says the agency has not issued rulemaking for crypto and has criticized the agency for taking a \"regulation by enforcement\" approach.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Monday's lawsuit marks the second time over the last few weeks that the crypto industry has sued the SEC. Digital asset company LEJILEX <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20240220458690\/en\/SEC%E2%80%99s-Unlawful-Targeting-of-Digital-Asset-Industry-Challenged-in-New-Lawsuit-From-Startup-LEJILEX-and-Crypto-Freedom-Alliance-of-Texas\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sued<\/span><\/a> the SEC in February in a Texas court over the agency's \"unlawful targeting\" of the crypto industry.

The SEC often invokes the Howey Test, based on a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case frequently cited by the SEC, to determine if an asset qualifies as an investment contract and, therefore, a security.<\/span><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;The test says an asset has to have three components \u2014&nbsp; an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"But the BEBA token airdrops are free, there is no common enterprise between Beba and token recipients, and there is no reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others,\" they said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Beba recently made its first airdrop and plans to do a second one. The BEBA token functions like airline miles, except it can also be freely traded. Token holders can also buy an exclusive line of duffel bags at a discounted price, they said in the complaint.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CLike any business owner, I\u2019m always thinking about new and innovative ways to reach more customers, grow support for our products, and build more awareness of Beba\u2019s mission,\u201D said Nathan Hennigh, co-founder of Beba in a statement. \u201CUnfortunately, my brother and I are operating in a state of constant uncertainty because of the SEC\u2019s dangerous track record of haphazardly going after businesses that use digital assets just like our $BEBA token.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC also should have gotten input from the public when deciding that most digital assets are securities, the DeFi Education Fund and Beba said in the complaint.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The digital asset industry was forced to learn about this new policy through the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions, which provided only nominal analysis concluding that transactions involving digital assets were securities transactions\u2014or that the digital assets themselves were securities\u2014and little explanation or legal analysis,\" they said. \"That behind closed-doors policymaking approach deprived the digital asset industry and the public of its right under the APA to receive notice of and provide comments on the SEC\u2019s new policy.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC has 60 days to respond to the complaint.
