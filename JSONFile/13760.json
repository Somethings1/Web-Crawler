These features will be rolled out to other markets in the coming months.&nbsp;","These tools are enabled through APIs from Bitpanda's white-label business that allows platforms to tap into its trading tools. It will be available to access via the trading section of the N26 app's forthcoming \"Finances\" tab.&nbsp;","\u201CWhile cryptocurrencies have seen a decline in value over the last year, they remain a requested and interesting asset class for investors and a growing part of the financial system,\" said N26 CEO Valentin Stalf in the announcement. \"Cryptocurrency trading is often the entry point to investing for a new generation of investors who are looking to explore ways to grow their wealth.\"&nbsp;","The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/110577\/thiel-german-neobank-n26-crypto-exchanges-trading-feature\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> in July last year that the German neobank was working with a \"top-tier crypto exchange\" on a new trading feature. This was initially pegged for a late 2021 release.&nbsp;","While N26 has over 8 million customers across Europe, many will have to wait to access the new features. Bitpanda is yet to obtain a license from Germany's financial regulator, BaFin, meaning that the launch of N26 Crypto in its native country is currently not set in stone.&nbsp;","\"The BaFin license comes with a particularly high priority,\" said a Bitpanda spokesperson. \"We have been in the process of acquiring the most extensive license for some time now in order to create a serious and regulated environment for investments in digital assets in Germany.\"&nbsp;","Along with Austrian regulatory approval, Bitpanda is also registered with the French, Italian, Swedish and Spanish regulatory authorities \u2014 key markets for N26.&nbsp;","The move to offer these features represents a border push by fintech firms to offer crypto features, despite current market conditions. Earlier this month, banking platform Step <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/176390\/step-secures-300-million-in-debt-funding-launches-crypto-investment-service\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> a crypto investment platform aimed at its core demographic of minors and young adults. Other neobanks such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174960\/fintech-unicorn-stash-deepens-its-push-into-crypto-with-eight-new-offerings\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stash<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/171631\/revolut-expands-us-crypto-offering-dogecoin-shiba-ina\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Revolut<\/a> have also recently sought to expand their crypto offerings via a partnership with infrastructure provider Apex Crypto.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
