And if so, what does this mean for businesses that are holding and\/or using crypto?<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto and sanctions evasion<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although crypto transfers are traceable, there is a possibility that designated Russian persons and entities could turn to cryptocurrencies to try to evade sanctions.&nbsp; This is particularly true for decentralized exchanges (DEX) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which use smart contracts to execute transactions. DEX and DeFi are not currently regulated for anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT), meaning that no customer due diligence, sanctions screening, monitoring of transactions or any other related measures are carried out. Crypto transactions are pseudonymous and without identity verification, so it is difficult to know who the actual holder of a crypto wallet is. The use of virtual private networks (VPNs) further complicates this, as does the existence of privacy coins.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There is precedent for using crypto to evade sanctions in Iran, where a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elliptic.co\/blog\/how-iran-uses-bitcoin-mining-to-evade-sanctions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">study by Elliptic<\/b><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> shows that approximately 4.5% of Bitcoin mining takes place.

There is currently a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies to make payments in Russia and earlier this year, the Central Bank of Russia proposed an all-out ban on cryptocurrencies and mining. That, however, has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.themoscowtimes.com\/2022\/02\/21\/crypto-a76437\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">not stopped Russian citizens from holding cryptoassets<\/b><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">: \u201CAccording to the Russian government, $5 billion in transactions are conducted using cryptocurrencies every year in the country, and its population of 144 million owns about $26.5 billion worth of crypto in over 12 million cryptocurrency accounts.\u201D&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, converting crypto to fiat currency remains a challenge due to the sanctions in place and banks\u2019 wider reluctance to risk processing payments originating from Russia.

Firms should also make an effort to check the public wallet addresses of incoming\/outgoing payments where possible, so that they do not fall foul of sanctions themselves.
