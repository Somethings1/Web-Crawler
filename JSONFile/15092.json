It\u2019s done so by adopting the Digital Token Identifier (DTI) ISO standard, according to a Monday press release.","Stocks, bonds and other older financial instruments around the globe already use various standardized ID codes \u2013 a way to make it simpler to find and trade them and one of the trappings Wall Street types expect when navigating markets. So the emergence of DTI is a way to make crypto more palatable for TradFi. Meanwhile, FIX is what conveys trades throughout TradFi.","\u201CAdding the DTI standard to the FIX Protocol was an easy decision as the DTI extends the existing functionality to the world of digital assets, which helps the market evolve to work with this asset class,\u201D Jim Kaye, executive director at FIX, said in the press release. \u201CWe can see many benefits of adding the DTI, including making it easier for the industry to audit their transactions and increase transparency, thereby bringing more efficiencies to the market.\u201D","The press release noted that DTI can be used by regulators to monitor digital trades for anti-money laundering and monitoring risk in trading, too.","Over 1,300 DTIs have been issued already, according to the press release. This includes private ledgers and tokenized assets.","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"DTI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Digital Token Identifier (DTI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ISO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jim Kaye","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Wall Street","Trading","TradFi","Protocols"],"authors":["Lyllah Ledesma"]}
