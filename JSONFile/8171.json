A vanity block contains a transaction so large that it intentionally fills up the entire block \u2014 leaving no room for any other transactions.","The NFT is called \"The Last POW Block\" and, like all VanityBlocks, shows a pair of eyes peering out from a black background.","VanityBlocks founder <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/monkeyontheloo_\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MonkeyOnTheLoose<\/a> told The Block on Thursday that they had been working on this final-block project for about a month \u2014 despite being aware it had a slim chance of success.","\"I guess it's a meditation artsy kinda thing,\" MonkeyOnTheLoose said via Telegram. \"Been working on [VanityBlocks] for a year now. Going against all [odds]. We had like a 15% chance to actually get it.\"&nbsp;","The final proof-of-work block also contained the text, \"You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick.\"","VanityBlocks are an expensive way to mint an NFT. VanityBlocks paid 31 ETH ($49,600) directly to mining pool F2Pool to mint the NFT and spent 1.3 ETH on transaction fees (partly burned and partly sent to f2Pool). MonkeyOnTheLoose said they raised 70 ETH from investors in three days to make this happen.","VanityBlocks' method of seizing entire Ethereum blocks <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/133278\/a-crypto-project-is-using-up-whole-ethereum-blocks-and-turning-them-into-nfts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">gained some attention<\/a> back in February.
