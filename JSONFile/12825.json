The affected tokens include AVA-ETH, SPELL-AVAXC and FTM-ETH, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/binance\/status\/1661649462387957760?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">per Binance<\/a>. Deposits of these assets on other networks will continue uninterrupted, and users were told to refer to Binance\u2019s deposit page for further information.","\u201CWe are temporarily suspending deposits for the following bridged tokens-network while we await clarity from the Multichain team,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/binance\/status\/1661649462387957760?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said Binance<\/a>.&nbsp;","The suspension of these tokens follows a five-day long crisis experienced by Multichain users, which has impacted the processing of transactions, leading to multiple stuck transactions. Several of Multichain\u2019s cross-chain bridge pathways \u2014 including Kava, zkSync, and Polygon zkEVM \u2014 are still not yet operational.","The Multichain project initially attributed the problem to technical issues. However, as discontent among users escalated, the explanation was updated to an ambiguous \u201Cforce majeure.\u201D","Multichain's issues come alongside unverified rumors on Twitter that the core leadership team may have been arrested in China. The Multichain team has not yet responded to the rumors regarding their alleged arrest. In the meantime, the platform\u2019s users and the broader crypto community are left grappling with uncertainty and apprehension as they await clear information.&nbsp;","The project\u2019s Discord server and Telegram groups have provided no substantial updates to community members so far.&nbsp;","In response, crypto projects are reacting to the team\u2019s silence. In a separate development, the Fantom Foundation <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232049\/fantom-foundation-justin-sun-hashkey-take-action-multichain-issues\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">withdrew<\/a> 450,000 MULTI tokens ($2.4 million) from liquidity on the decentralized exchange SushiSwap. Yesterday, crypto investment firm HashKey Group moved $250,000 to the crypto exchange Gate.io, and Tron founder Justin Sun withdrew 470,000 of the USDD stablecoin from the Multichain protocol itself.","Â© 2023 The Block.
