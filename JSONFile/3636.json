Next in line was Arbitrum, which saw 31.4 million transactions over the past 30 days.","The recent rise in transaction volume on zkSync has been attributed to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266272\/brc-20-style-tokens-are-spreading-to-chains-beyond-bitcoin-but-why\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">spread of inscriptions<\/a> \u2014 a feature originally created on Bitcoin \u2014 to EVM networks, including most Layer 2 chains.","Data from L2Beat highlights that zkSync experienced its biggest monthly transaction surge on Dec. 16. That's when sync inscription was rolled out on the network and constituted 4.6 million of the 5.3 million transactions that day alone, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/hildobby\/inscriptions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dune data<\/a> aggregated by Dragonfly analyst Hildobby.","zkSync operates as a Layer 2 network on the Ethereum mainnet. By bundling hundreds or thousands of transactions into a single cryptographic proof, it verifies transactions much faster and more cheaply than the mainnet.","Since mid-December, inscription-related transactions have contributed to zkSync\u2019s overall activity, helping it surpass both Ethereum and its Layer 2s.","Inscriptions are data embeds found in transaction call data, which, like Ordinals on Bitcoin, can be used to create alternate tokens and NFTs. Such tokens include&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236632\/ordinals-like-tokens-on-ethereum-surge-past-1-million-in-volume\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethscriptions<\/a> on Ethereum, Doginals on Dogecoin and Solana Inscriptions on Solana.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
