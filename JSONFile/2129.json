The collapsed crypto exchange began bankruptcy proceedings late last year after millions of customers lost their money.","Virtu's spokesperson took another shot at Lewis' credibility, saying the author's claims about the $10 million lost are \"as accurate as his understanding of market structure in 'Flash Boys.'\"","Published in 2014, Lewis' book on high frequency trading has been lambasted by some critics for its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/buttonwoods-notebook\/2014\/05\/07\/hft-the-backlash-continues\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">depiction<\/a> of the subject matter and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2014\/11\/24\/hft-critic-michael-lewis-dead-wrong-author.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">alleged<\/a> inaccuracies.","During an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/206253\/virtu-continues-to-see-crypto-as-a-long-term-growth-opportunity\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">earnings call<\/a> at the beginning of this year, Virtu's CEO Doug Cifu said that \"although we had an approximate 8-figure fiat and coin balances deployed across several venues when the FTX news broke, we acted quickly and did not realize any material losses.\"","As a global market maker in equities and other financial products, Virtu commands a relatively low profile within crypto.
