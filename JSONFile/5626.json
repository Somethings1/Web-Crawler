Both are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">top 10<\/a> blockchain platforms by market cap.","At the time, there was a big debate over whether Ethereum should be a for-profit corporation or a non-profit. It was almost incubated as a company but the paper was never signed. This issue was divisive and even led to the ousting of Hoskinson from the group.","\u201CPeople are harder to tightly coordinate in small groups than I expected. You can't just get everyone to sit around in a circle, see each other's inherent goodness and get along, especially when huge incentive conflicts are at play,\u201D Buterin <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1433199904713678855\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">added<\/a> in response to a similar question.","In terms of the design of the Ethereum Virtual Machine itself, Buterin <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1433255593683259398\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> it was a bad idea to make it 256 bit, whereas it should have been \u201C64 bit with an arbitrary-size bigint feature.\u201D This refers to processing power, with 64 bits systems able to process data more quickly.","Buterin speculated that if he wasn\u2019t into crypto, he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1433240431588872194\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">would probably<\/a> be working on designing a kind of social media platform.&nbsp;","He also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1433229704765394946\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">discussed<\/a> that he still remains somewhat of a digital nomad, although he moves around more slowly now, living in places for months at a time.&nbsp;","\u201CI feel like my huge span of time in Singapore last year changed me quite a bit. It was interesting to just... be by myself and with my own thoughts for the first time in nearly a decade,\u201D he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1433238556839841794\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk also weighed in, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1433231578189107203\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">asking<\/a> Buterin what love is.
