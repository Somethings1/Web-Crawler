The platform started to gain its popularity with their one-click copy trading function and invited well-known traders to use the feature, allowing users to track their portfolio operations and follow their moves in one click. Bitget has then partnered with world-class footballers, such as Lionel Messi, Juventus F.C. and more to merge the sports communities into Web3. Furthermore, Bitget recently announced a $30 million investment in multi-chain wallet BitKeep to obtain a controlling stake as their big move in connecting CeFi and DeFi. We talked to Bitget's Managing Director, Gracy Chen, to find out Bitget's next plan.","Bitget is going beyond derivatives to expand its product offerings, creating a one-stop crypto investment solution for its users.","Bitget was founded with a steadfast belief in being the last 10% who remain committed even in the face of adversity.","Compared to other glamorous crypto startups such as FTX at the same period, Bitget's early days were relatively unknown. If FTX's emergence was like a sprinter, Bitget would look more like a marathon runner. Born in a bear market, it insists on putting users first, focusing on product innovation, and advocating long-term prospects with the spirit of \"earnestness.\" The company aims to inspire people to embrace crypto and improve the way they trade, one at a time.","High barriers to crypto investment hinder its mass adoption. Copy trading with more social interactions will be the key. Bitget is the first and largest crypto copy trading platform, connecting beginners with professional traders to create a \"hands off, gains up\" experience. Since its launch, the copy trading feature on Bitget has attracted more than 80,000 elite traders to share their strategies and more than 380,000 followers to copy.","As of Jan 2023, the number of profitable trades through Bitget copy trading is over 47 million, with gains from profitable trades reaching 300 million, and profits shared by elite traders reaching USD 20 million.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitget dives into Web3 by introducing innovative products that combine the best of CeFi and DeFi<\/strong>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by Bitget<\/i><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
