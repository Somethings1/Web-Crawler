An integration with Copper brings Hashnote\u2019s USYC to the custody firm\u2019s clientele of around 300 large institutions and crypto trading platforms.","Blockchain-based versions of U.S. Treasury bonds and things like yield-bearing tokens and stablecoins have become popular as the trend for institution-friendly tokenization gathers pace within crypto. However, not all the tokenized Treasury-type offerings in the market are created equal, according to Hashnote CEO Leo Mizuhara.","\u201CPeople are treating these on-chain treasuries as if they were as safe as something you\u2019d see in normal finance, like a money market account,\u201D Mizuhara said in an interview. \u201CBut different structures matter a lot; it\u2019s not the same as being in a money market fund when you are in an SPV [special purpose vehicle] that owns Treasuries, for example, or an SPV that owns ETFs [exchange traded funds].\u201D","Hashnote\u2019s USYC token is based on the reverse repo, or holding Treasury Bills overnight with a guaranteed price the next day, Mizuhara pointed out and offers a net yield of about 4.8%.","\u201CNot everyone gets access to the reverse repo window,\u201D said Copper\u2019s head of sales Michael Roberts in an interview. \u201CThat really is the mainstay of the big banks and some broker-dealers. Longer term, we\u2019re working on a deeper integration where the token can persist and potentially be used as collateral as well.\u201D","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"4.8%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Hashnote\u2019s USYC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Philip Hammond","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Leo Mizuhara","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Roberts","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chicago","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Copper","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mizuhara","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Cumberland DRW","DeFi","Hashnote","Copper"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
