Users have reported that the issue has been ongoing for more than four hours as of the time of publishing. The project\u2019s official Discord addressed the issue, blaming Cloudflare, a tool that enables secure connections on the internet.","In a Reddit post, the Uniswap team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/UniSwap\/comments\/yxn2m4\/if_you_are_having_trouble_accessing_appuniswaporg\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">advised<\/a> users to connect to the protocol via its IPFS <a href=\"https:\/\/bafybeias77hrdbrsalgbx6ti2fhrmq3yvwuymt4lrnvhjgdwlbl4efdrni.ipfs.dweb.link\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">link<\/a>.
