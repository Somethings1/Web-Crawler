It still remained a record turnout as last year saw about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.parisblockchainweek.com\/media\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">6,000 people<\/a> attend.","Around 18,000 people were seen on site next to the Eiffel Tower at NFT Paris, the conference's founder Alexandre Tsydenkov told The Block.

In this environment, brand becomes incredibly important, he added.","\"People who could attend six or seven conferences, or sponsor six or seven conferences, are back to two or three,\" Amar said.","It takes almost a year to pull off Paris Blockchain Week with the help of over 20 full-time staff, Amar said. It can be challenging to execute a top tier event across multiple locations, he added.","\"When you think about conferences trying to do two locations, there's lots of respect because it's a lot,\" Amar said. \"For us, it's nine to 10 months really full-time just to produce one week of events.\"","What's driving the success of crypto events in European hubs such as Paris and Berlin?","For Paris, Amar believes it's a combination of factors, from strong travel links which bring in an international crowd, to the city also being a hub for blockchain engineers and home to several web3 unicorns, such as Ledger and The Sandbox.","\"NFT and metaverse is good for art, fashion and luxury, which Paris is pretty good about,\" Amar said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Paris Blockchain Week 2022 event space (Andrew Rummer\/The Block)<\/span>","With the U.S. cracking down on crypto companies and the regulatory environment remaining uncertain, many founders are looking to other hubs such as Paris, Lisbon and Dubai, which are providing clearer guidance, Amar added.","In February, the UK <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207488\/the-uk-finally-reveals-plan-to-regulate-crypto-trading-and-lending\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">unveiled<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> its plans for regulating crypto trading and lending.
