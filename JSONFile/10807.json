The most valuable companies in the world, like Google and Facebook, are so valuable because of their access to <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">your<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> data. Unfortunately, for anyone who doesn\u2019t want to be a part of this system, there is a lack of viable alternatives.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With major data scandals, like Cambridge Analytica-Facebook, regulations like GDPR and CCPA, and the growing demands for data rights, the world is waking up to what\u2019s happening with our data. Increasing digitisation not only means that every internet user creates approximately 1.7MB of data every second, but it\u2019s also time to think of or digital footprints and the way data is affecting our lives.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As the data economy continues to grow, set to reach 175 zettabytes in the next five years, it\u2019s crucial that people are recognised for their essential role in this vibrant economy. Unfortunately, despite growing income disparity, people don\u2019t have any way to receive their share for all their contributions. Instead, tech monoliths extract our data and reap the profits from it, leaving the rest of us behind.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Swash is rebalancing this power dynamic by putting people at the centre of the data economy. Through a friendly interface, Swash redistributes value back to the people who deserve it - everyday internet users.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As the world\u2019s first and largest Data Union, Swash is centred on giving back control to individuals, breaking free from data silos, and offering fair rewards.
