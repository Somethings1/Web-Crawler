The pets, which are also NFTs minted on Ethereum, are now trading on OpenSea. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wednesday\u2019s initial drop of unique AR creatures sold out almost immediately, according to Anima, causing the newly minted group of digital assets to crack OpenSea\u2019s top 10 trending collections on its first day of availability. The company said the first two batches of about 500 pets sold out in less than an hour. At the time of writing, Openbots ranked fifth on OpenSea\u2019s trending collections list.<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C[Bots] are very much in the zeitgeist right now. Elon Musk was obsessed with them. ChatGPT is probably the biggest story in tech this week,\u201D said Anima cofounder Alex Herrity. \u201CBut we don\u2019t really think about \u2018What do bots want?

While technically Amina has created the pets for humans to enjoy, AI bots can also acquire the digital creatures, according to Herrity.<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although Wednesday\u2019s initial launch quickly sold out, Anima plans to release more on top of adding additional functionality and animation based in part on what people choose to do with the virtual pets.<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis initial batch is aimed at the collectors,\u201D said Herrity, adding that Anima\u2019s long-term plan extends far beyond creating virtual NFT pets.
