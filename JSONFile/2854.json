Terming it a \u201Cmajor growth milestone,\u201D Paxful said it added over 800,000 wallets during the period and now services a total of 3 million wallets.","\u201CWe\u2019ve seen 15 million trades across the platform during the past year, a 65% increase versus the previous time period,\u201D Paxful announced Thursday, adding that Kenya and India, in particular, have shown continued volume growth in recent weeks.","Overall, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya are Paxful\u2019s \u201Cbig markets,\u201D because users in these African countries are \u201Crestricted by traditional financing,\u201D Paxful co-founder and COO, Artur Schaback, told The Block.","Earlier today, cryptocurrency exchange <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/44466\/binances-direct-fiat-to-crypto-trading-facility-goes-live-starting-with-nigerian-naira-pairs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance also listed<\/a> the first direct fiat-to-cryptocurrency trading pairs, starting with Nigerian naira (NGN). A Binance spokesperson told The Block that Nigeria is \"absolutely a promising market with great potential\" with a population of nearly 200 million people.","As for Paxful, the U.S. and India are also top markets, Schaback told The Block, adding that the average transaction size on the platform is \u201Cat a little over US$100.\u201D","Paxful credited the volume and wallets growth to its \u201Ccontinued efforts in building a community\u201D that focuses on education about P2P finance.","Paxful rival LocalBitcoins recently<a href=\"https:\/\/localbitcoins.com\/blog\/id-verification-update\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> strengthened<\/a> its KYC processes. For instance, someone who trades on its platform for up to 1,000 euros (~$1,110) in a year, will have to provide their full name, country of residence, email address and phone number. For a higher amount of trades, they have to provide additional information.","When asked if these measures by LocalBitcoins helped Paxful with its volumes, Schaback told The Block: \u201CWe aren\u2019t aware of whether this is directly related. However, we also take compliance and security very seriously,\u201D adding:","\u201CPaxful requires users around the world who reach an equivalent of $1,500 in trade volume or wallet activity to verify their accounts through ID verification. In addition, users who reach $10,000 in trade volume or wallet activity must provide ID verification as well as address verification.\u201D","Paxful currently only supports bitcoin on its platform and wants to remain as a bitcoin-only platform, Schaback told The Block, adding: \u201CWe believe that there should only be one cryptocurrency to make the financial revolution happen.\u201D","Paxful is \u201Ccompletely bootstrapped\u201D and \u201Cprofitable since its inception,\u201D Schaback told The Block but declined to disclose the firm\u2019s revenues and valuation. The current headcount of Paxful is 200 and it is \u201Ccontinuously hiring for new talents.\u201D"],"hashtag":[]}
