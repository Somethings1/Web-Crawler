The crew working on the project started with a lesser-known name - CDP Saver, in 2019, when there was only MakerDAO with their Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs) and later rebranded. The story of DeFi Saver started with a liquidation. While on a team retreat in Thailand, a personal, close-call experience with a potential liquidation of a DeFi position in Maker led one of the founders to think of a simple idea. He took a small part of the collateral to pay back part of his debt, increasing the collateral-to-debt ratio on which many DeFi protocols rely in providing overcollateralized loans, thereby reducing his risk of liquidation. The team went a long way from providing manual DeFi loan repayment and leveraging features in a single transaction - a DeFi first, for that matter, to becoming a go-to solution for automated liquidation protection and leverage management for the most trusted protocols. Over time, various on-chain automated strategies were introduced that can either automatically unwind (partially \"self-liquidate\") or fully close out (Stop Loss) a position if it becomes too risky.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:192,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the years that followed, as DeFi grew, DeFi Saver continuously expanded support for various lending and borrowing protocols, creating dedicated dashboards for Compound, Aave, Liquity, and Reflexer. Alongside continuous polishing and UI improvements, the team developed several powerful tools evolving into an impressive DeFi protocol aggregator with advanced DeFi asset management features.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:192,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Today DeFi users have all of their needs covered in one comprehensive app, including borrowing, lending, leveraging, and yield farming.
