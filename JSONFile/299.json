As an individual, hedge fund, or institution with no prior experience, the best way to get exposure to mining is by buying your own Bitcoin mining machines and hosting them at a low-cost secure data center.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What machine should you buy?<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The two most important details when evaluating different machines are hash rate and power usage. Hash rate is measured in terra hashes per second (TH\/s), and power usage is measured in watts (W).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">From these two details, you can calculate machine efficiency. Newer models have lower efficiency (J\/TH), meaning they require less energy to produce the same number of hashes. This means new machines have higher operating margins.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Two other key factors to consider are the cost of the machines and the electricity cost when your machine runs. Machine prices are correlated with the price of Bitcoin and the current supply and demand dynamics of the machine market. Electricity rates are determined by where you host your machines and how long you lock in your hosting contract. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockwaresolutions.com\/the-block\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Request a Quote from Blockware Solutions<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> for both machine prices and hosting prices.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain Antminer S19XP&nbsp;<\/b>","<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-136101 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bitmain-Antminer-S19XP-.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"384\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">","<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-136102 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bitmain-Antminer-S19XP-chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"313\" height=\"232\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Daily revenue, daily cost, and daily profit are calculated using an electricity rate of $0.075 per kWh, a $39,500 Bitcoin price, and a hash price of $0.18 (February 25th, 2022).<\/span><\/i>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro<\/b>","<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-136103 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bitmain-Antminer-S19j-Pro-.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"384\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">","<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-136104 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Bitmain-Antminer-S19j-Pro-chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"310\" height=\"232\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whatsminer M30s+<\/b>","<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-136105 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Whatsminer-M30s-.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"393\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">","<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-136106 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Whatsminer-M30s-chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"346\" height=\"232\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s important to note that daily revenue, daily cost, and profit do change over time.
