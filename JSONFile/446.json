At the time, it began research and development efforts. A year later, the firm started mining bitcoin, and it then tested its first wallet and storage solution with employees in 2016.","Over the years, Fidelity has expanded its crypto services. Last week, the firm partnered with crypto lender BlockFi to custody pledged bitcoin. That means Fidelity's clients can now commit their custodied bitcoin as collateral against USD loans financed by BlockFi. The service is aimed at giving Fidelity's clients access to liquidity while holding their bitcoin."],"hashtag":[]}
