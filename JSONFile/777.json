Taiko did not disclose a valuation.","Taiko is building a scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 one it\u2019s crafting to emulate Ethereum as closely as possible in design and ideology, according to an announcement. It describes its product as a Type 1 zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine. Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin&nbsp;previously <a href=\"https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2022\/08\/04\/zkevm.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a> in a blog post that Type 1 zkEVMs are \u201Cwhat we ultimately need make the Ethereum layer 1 itself more scalable.\u201D","\u201COur design decisions are to stick to the EVM spec and indeed the Ethereum spec as closely as possible, one because we love Ethereum and we want to extend it\u2026 and also because we find it affords the best properties,\u201D said Matthew Finestone, a Taiko Labs co-founder.","The company <a href=\"https:\/\/taiko.mirror.xyz\/wD7yN8Y5RttbP7kzdtX22GbMg6i18a-Xwet2sshpt48\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">released<\/a> the latest version of its testnet earlier this week, which it hailed as \u201Cthe next step on the road to a decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent ZK-EVM.\u201D","Wang and Finestone previously worked together at Loopring Foundation, a trading and payment protocol built on zk-rollup technology. Wang was its founder and CEO from July 2017 until November 2021, while Finestone spent three years with the project as its head of business.","Wang, who spent four years at Google earlier in his career, said that, after Loopring, he hoped to build a decentralized social network but ran into a problem. \u201CThere\u2019s no way I can deploy my social network because the infrastructure is not there. There\u2019s no way it will be scaled,\u201D he explained. Thus, the idea for Taiko was born.","\u201CWe want to bring blockchain technology closer to improving the life quality of everyone around the world,\u201D Wang said. \u201CWe are still very far away from being ready to change everybody\u2019s life.\u201D","Wang added that Taiko\u2019s first two rounds of financing will secure the successful launch of its mainnet but that the project will likely raise more capital, in part to set up an ecosystem investment fund for luring dApps and developers to the ecosystem.","In structure, too, Taiko will look to follow Ethereum\u2019s lead.&nbsp;\u201CWe are going to quickly convert the organization into a non-profit one. Ideally we\u2019ll operate very similarly to the Ethereum Foundation,\u201D Wang said.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This article has been updated to clarify that Anthony Sassano is not part of the Ethereum Foundation.&nbsp;<\/em>"],"hashtag":["SEED &AMP; PRE-SEED","ZKEVM"]}
