Interoperability between different classes of applications, assets and consensus is realized via coordination by the Poly Relay Chain. Compared to existing cross-chain solutions, Poly Network is more inclusive and offers more advanced security. It is sustainable for end-users in that multiple blockchains come together to create a shared ecosystem, where decentralized applications communicate with one another through their interactions and liquidity is reliably secured. In this capacity, Poly Network offers a systematic development framework for developers of all tiers, e.g., infrastructure, smart contracts, applications etc., to participate in the establishment of the ecosystem.

Developers can include any type of assets, e.g., fungible\/non-fungible, native cryptocurrency\/token, etc., into Poly Network simply by specifying the smart contract of a specific asset and the core messages that essentially describe activities related to the token (usually blockchain events signaled by the contract). In practice, the compatibility of Poly Network with diverse crypto assets means&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Poly Network\u2019s infrastructure is fully open-sourced and is based on:&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The design of the infrastructure is open to the entire ecosystem so that any developer can implement new components to the infrastructure by the general design. This feature enables the development community of Poly Network to be highly decentralized, with potential contributions from developers all over the world. Furthermore, Poly Network allows developers to interface their infrastructure to other applications through well-defined interoperation APIs. Specifically, applications from other ecosystems can delegate interoperation services to Poly Network via calling the APIs instead of having to implement the service from scratch. To sum up, Poly Network offers an open design which<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/span>","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Poly Network provides developers with a systematic development framework and tool support (specified in detail in the open document center <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dev-docs.poly.network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">https:\/\/dev-docs.poly.network<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">). The framework supports the development of both the infrastructure of Poly Network and the services enabled by it. We use the following use cases to explain the development experience with Poly Network.<\/span><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Integration with a new blockchain<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. To integrate a new blockchain into Poly Network\u2019s ecosystem, e.g., Polygon, developers need roughly 4 steps for the implementation:<\/span><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/span>","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Furthermore, Poly Network plans to release a toolchain for developers to not only implement but also design, validate, audit, and upgrade Poly Network as well. We believe that systematic development support is the core contributor to a prosperous developer community and therefore the whole ecosystem.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cross-chain capabilities have always been at the center of the discussion on blockchain interoperability. While we believe that cross-chain is a common and popular use case for blockchain interoperations, the concept of interoperability means much more than that in a multi-chain space. In addition to supporting the circulation of crypto assets across heterogeneous blockchains, Poly Network defines standard smart contract interfaces for developers to implement general-purpose business logic, rather than simply the management of tokens. This flexibility enables Poly Network to further benefit from blockchain composability by bridging itself to other applications via the general-purpose interfaces, while those applications stay unchanged. The idea of universal interoperability also indicates the atomicity for blockchain state transitions in general, as opposed to mere asset transfers. Upcoming upgrades to Poly Network will focus on providing more development capabilities for the realization of universal interoperability and its potential applications too.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Poly Network is a global cross-chain protocol for implementing blockchain interoperability and building Web3.0 infrastructure. Poly Network has integrated almost 30 blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, HECO, OKC, Neo, Ontology, Zilliqa, Harmony, Metis, etc. Since its launch, the protocol has enabled cross-chain asset transfers of more than USD 16 billion.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/span>","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/span>","","&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the help of Poly Network, whether you wish to expand the market reach of an existing dApp or build a brand new dApp, implementation becomes simple.
