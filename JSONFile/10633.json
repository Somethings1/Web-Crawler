It is also integrated with Wormhole, which gives Prime Protocol connectivity with non-Ethereum based chains.","It does not currently have a token live, but may at some point in the future, Conley said. Once live, it plans to run incentives to bootstrap liquidity. There may be an airdrop or some type of reward for people who participate on its mainnet, he added.","Many protocols \u2014 such as Polygon\u2019s flagship derivatives exchange Gains Network \u2014 have added support for Ethereum scaling platform Arbitrum recently. Arbitrum is an Ethereum Layer 2 that currently has the highest market share in the sector, <a href=\"https:\/\/l2beat.com\/scaling\/tvl\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to L2Beat. Prime Protocol is also integrated with Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche and Fantom.","Cross-chain applications have started to pick up some traction with interoperability platforms such as LayerZero, Axelar and Wormhole further along in their development. After some growing pains, building applications that mitigate the need to bridge are becoming more of a reality.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
