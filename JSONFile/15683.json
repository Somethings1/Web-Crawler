BlackRock\u2019s IBIT is now the fifth largest ETF (of all) by inflows this year, with rival funds not far behind. It\u2019s not yet clear whether this rate of growth can keep pace and match the bullish predictions set by firms like Standard Chartered Bank and Fidelity for meteoric end-of-year ETF valuations, but it is obvious that bitcoin ETFs are here to stay.","The question is how will Wall Street approach this newfound way to gain bitcoin exposure, and will regular investors want a piece of the action?","\u201CWe think bitcoin could be one of the most talked about brands on Wall Street in the next decade,\u201D Mike Willis, CEO and founder of ONEFUND, said. \u201CYou're at the beginning of the \u2018bitcoin era\u2019 on Wall Street.\u201D Although remiss to offer a price prediction, Willis said he thinks bitcoin could easily catch up to gold's market cap.","It\u2019s an interesting prediction given ONEFUND\u2019s strategy in launching its own bundle of bitcoin ETFs. The independent index fund operation, most known for its $106 million INDEX ETF that tracks the S&P 500, plans to launch a number of \u201CCyber Hornet\u201D funds that hold both bitcoin and traditional equities in a bid to appeal to risk averse retail investors.","Most wealth managers will not advise their clients to take more than a 1%-3% allocation in crypto, Willis said. But even that small recommendation could open up financial advisers to legal risks. \u201CHardcore bitcoiners might be used to it, but 90% of Wall Street and just traditional investors are not used to being down 40% in a given month.\u201D","\u201CIf I'm down 40% for clients they\u2019re burnin up my phone, if I'm down 50% they're out, if I'm down 60% or 70% it's a potential fiduciary liability \u2014 a potential lawsuit. Advisers are aware of that,\u201D Willis, who co-founded ONEFUND in 2015 after stints at UBS, Paine Webber and Smith Barney, said.","The ETF closest to launch, which has received approval by the SEC under the ticker ZZZ, will allocate 75% of its capital to the S&P and 25% to bitcoin futures (with an option also to hold spot bitcoin, Willis said). The idea is to help mitigate bitcoin\u2019s potential downside risk and notable volatility by investing in \u201Cthe most widely held index strategy on Wall Street.\u201D","Willis said he predicts a number of hybrid funds to launch with strategies that protect the downside \u201Cvol,\u201D or volatility, of bitcoin, perhaps using U.S. Treasuries and\/or other less risky asset classes. This will also be a way for funds to differentiate themselves, given the crowded competition after 11 spot bitcoin ETFs were approved on the same day.","Like many, Willis sees a race to the bottom in terms of management fees \u2014 given that it's one of the few ways firms can undercut their competition. Others are offering promotions, like Bitwise slashing fees to zero for the first six months or until the fund reaches a certain asset threshold. But these marketing efforts can work only for a limited time.","The other way for firms to compete is how they treat the underlying bitcoin they buy with investors\u2019 money \u2014 either leveraging it to earn yield for the company or holding it in cold storage. Some funds, Willis said, may rehypothecate (or loan out) the bitcoins in order to earn a return, which can earn \u201Chundreds of basis points.\u201D","See also: A Bitcoin ETF Will Never Be Your Bitcoin | Opinion","For its part, ONEFUND has no intention of competing on fees, and thinks it will be able to charge higher rates because it\u2019ll guarantee in its prospectus that the bitcoins won\u2019t move from cold storage (the firm is talking with Caitlin Long\u2019s Custodia Bank for custody services). But there are other, somewhat intangible ways that firms can diversify away from the pack.","For instance, the one firm holding firm to high fees is Grayscale, which is charging 1.5% on its popular GBTC product. GBTC has a lot of brand equity built up as the first traditional on-ramp into bitcoin, launching initially as a close-ended trust in 2013. The fund has seen notable withdrawals since it transitioned to an ETF this year, though Willis said he\u2019s surprised the fund hasn\u2019t lost more.","\u201CIt's loyalty. It's laziness. And the other side is bitcoiners don't want to go to BlackRock or Fidelity \u2014 they want to keep it in the community,\u201D he said. ONEFUND is hoping to tap into that same sense of bitcoiner camaraderie, a sort of non-institutional institution. That\u2019s part of the reason why it chose the Cyber Hornet branding, a phrase most closely associated with uber-bitcoiner Michael Saylor, who is not affiliated with the product.","The firm, which made news when it allowed its INDEX fund shareholders to vote by proxy, has also secured a number of \u201Ckickass\u201D tickers for its ETFs, which will all have different allocations between bitcoin and the S&P500. Triple-letter tickers, like \u201Cthe Qs,\u201D standing for Nasdaq\u2019s QQQ, are valuable real-estate, Willis said, mentioning the \u201Ctriple Z\u201D ticker on his firm\u2019s flagship bitcoin ETF.","Indeed, a number of recently launched ETFs carry meme-worthy names, including Valkyrie's BRRR (referring to the pandemic era \u201Cmoney printer go BRR\u201D meme) and VanEck\u2019s HODL (referencing how bitcoiners buy, hold and rarely sell).","See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | Opinion","\"We think the branding is going to stand for doing things the \u2018right way,\u2019 the non-institutional choice that represents the community,\u201D Willis said. \u201CWe're not owned by BlackRock, we're not owned by the big institutions.\"","Still, in some sense, Willis' game plan revolves around Wall Street entering the picture. Although it may not be the most \"orthodox\" way to get people using bitcoin, it is the easiest and safest route to mass onboarding into bitcoin economy via ETFs, perhaps fulfilling Cory Klippsten's dream of creating \"10 million bitcoiners,\" Willis said.","The first turn of the supposed flywheel came last year, when BlackRock announced its plan to launch a bitcoin ETF, which in a way gave other Wall Street firms cover to also get involved. Now that ETFs are actually live, over the next decade more and more capital will flow into bitcoin \u2014 beginning with model portfolios, retirement accounts, pension plans and ultimately culminating in it becoming a \"mainstream asset class,\" Willis said.","\"Bitcoin has been alive and well for 15 years, but on Wall Street it's been non-existent,\" he said. \"This changes everything.\""],"entity":[{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cory Klippsten","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Smith Barney","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"UBS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"40%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Caitlin Long\u2019s Custodia Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$106 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BlackRock\u2019s IBIT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mike Willis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Saylor","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Willis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"3%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Grayscale","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Paine Webber","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"75%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"VanEck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"\u201D Willis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Standard Chartered Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nasdaq","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","Wall Street","ETFs","Bitcoin ETF","S&P 500"],"authors":["Daniel Kuhn"]}
