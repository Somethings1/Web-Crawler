Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin made the first symbolic transaction on the network.","Polygon zkEVM provides full EVM opcode compatibility \u2014 meaning developers and users can utilize the same code, tools and applications as on Ethereum. ZK-rollups work by aggregating multiple transactions off-chain into a single batch, which is then submitted to the main chain as a single transaction. Zero-knowledge proofs verify the transactions without revealing data, resulting in lower fees and enhanced security.&nbsp;","As a major focus of Ethereum scaling development, blockchain projects, including Polygon, Starknet, ZkSync and Scroll, have been competing to develop a functional ZK-based Layer 2 solution capable of natively supporting Ethereum applications.","In June, the Polygon team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234354\/polygon-2-zk\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">revealed<\/a> plans for Polygon 2.0 \u2014 a network of zero-knowledge-powered Layer 2 blockchains. Earlier this month, it also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239350\/polygon-upgrade-matic-tokens-to-pol\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposed<\/a> upgrading its native MATIC token to POL as part of the Polygon 2.0 roadmap.","Â© 2023 The Block.
