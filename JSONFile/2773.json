The bridge operates through pools of funds stored on each chain.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Stargate bridge connects the Fantom blockchain to seven other blockchains. On each of these chains are pools of funds containing the anyUSDC stablecoin, which was issued by Multichain and is a commonly used stablecoin on Fantom. The proposal seeks to disconnect the Fantom pools from Stargate's other pools and lower exposure to the stablecoin.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, the proposal has 1.1 million vested stargate tokens in favor, with just 16,000 votes against. It is still yet to reach the 2 million quorum necessary for it to be carried out.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The reasoning behind the proposal is to reduce exposure to any tokens connected with Multichain, another cross-chain protocol. Multichain has had ongoing issues for a week, with delayed transactions and three cross-chain routes still offline. The team initially said this was due to an upgrade that was getting fixed, but the explanation was changed on May 24 to an ambiguous \"force majeure.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On Twitter, unverified rumors have surfaced that the team was arrested in China.
