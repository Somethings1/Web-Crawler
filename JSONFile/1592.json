The suit accuses Chao and Leung of fraud and embezzlement.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It is a countersuit to a complaint filed by Temujin Labs in November against Abittan and two Findora's former co-founders, Charles Lu and Benjamin Fisch. The larger dispute is over who is the rightful owner of Findora\u2019s assets and intellectual property.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Abittan's account provides some clues as to the reason that most of Findora's founding members have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/89264\/findora-defi-founding-team-departures\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mysteriously disowned<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> the project in recent months. But there are still more questions than answers about what exactly happened behind the scenes.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to the complaint, Abittan said he got to know Chao and Leung around May 2016, and the three worked together to run luxury watch businesses between 2016 and 2019.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the time, according to Abittan, Chao went by the name Tiffany Chen (or Yuting Chen) and was married to Leung, who went by the name Tao Ding. Abittan said in the filing that in one instance, he wired money to \u201CWells Fargo bank accounts in the name of Yuting Chen and Tao Ding\u201D to purchase watches from the couple.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Based on their existing business relationship, in 2018 the three jointly formed firms called Juniper Ventures and Eian Labs with external investment Abittan secured, according to the new filing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Abittan said upon founding the blockchain business, Chen told him she would change her alias to \u201CLily Chao\u201D and Ding would change his to \u201CDamien Leung.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Her name wasn\u2019t the only thing she made up, according to the filing. \u201CChao also routinely lied to Findora investors and employees about her relationship with Ding, claiming that Ding was her brother-in-law and not her husband,\u201D Abittan stated in his complaint. The alleged explanation was necessary due to the \u201CSilicon Valley culture frowning on husband\/wife relationships at work.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Abittan further alleged that in July 2019, Chao and Leung \u201Cfraudulently induced\u201D him to sign an agreement to divest Findora\u2019s assets owned by Eian to Temujin, an entity over which neither he nor any other Eian investors had control.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Subsequently, the Findora project formally launched in July 2019 with a website that excluded Abittan\u2019s name even though he claims he hired key members and advisors, including Lu (Findora\u2019s co-founder and former CEO) and Fisch (co-founder and former CTO).&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the November lawsuit that Findora filed against Abittan, the firm alleged that Abittan\u2019s claim that he is entitled to Findora\u2019s asset caused a massive resignation in October.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An investigation by The Block, however, revealed that much of the founding team jumped ship after discovering the two had solicited private token raises since June from Chinese investors without the rest of the team\u2019s knowledge.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In his countersuit, Abittan accused Chao of appropriating Findora\u2019s funds. He alleged that \u201CChao raised millions of dollars on behalf of Findora in private financings,\u201D and transferred funds to a personal Binance account. He also alleges that she directed Findora\u2019s team in China to wire \u201Csignificant sums of money\u201D to an e-commerce company called Xipin.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CNeither Plaintiff...nor Findora\u2019s U.S. CEO at the time, was aware of any legitimate purpose for these transfers,\u201D Abittan alleged in the complaint.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Findora, Chao or Leung have not responded to The Block\u2019s request for comment and clarification via email and direct messages.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But Chinese business registration records reveal that there are some connections between Findora and Xipin.
