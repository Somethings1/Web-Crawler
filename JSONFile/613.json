So far the company\u2019s most important creative partner has been Kyle Killen, writer-producer of the TV-adaption of the popular \u201CHalo\u201D video game. Killen, the writer and \u201Cstory architect\u201D behind StoryCo\u2019s first project \u201CThe Disco Ball,\u201D joined forces with StoryCo earlier this year.

The first chapter is available online and StoryCo's expectation is that the story will continue to unfold over the next several months as \u201Ccreators from around the globe expand and extend the story world alongside its chief creators.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The first episodes of the animated series \u201CThe Disco Ball\u201D are initially being created by Killen, tasked with writing duties, and a cast of actors with credits from hit shows like \u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\u201D \u201CThe Bear\u201D and \u201CThe Americans.\u201D Actors like Stephanie Beatriz and Costa Ronin are among those starring in the sci-fi project.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As \u201CThe Disco Ball\u201D narrative evolves, \u201Cartists, writers, musicians, actors, producers, and many other types of creators\u201D will be invited to create story elements and earn \u201CProfit Points,\u201D StoryCo said in a statement.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Minted on the blockchain, \u201CProfit Points\" will be awarded to participating creators and will be their way to share in the potential financial success of the show. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The company said it has already benefited from creative contributions including illustrations provided by a Nigerian art student, writing from a high school English teacher in New York state and a notable \u201Cvoice performance\u201D from a retired Disney employee in their 70s.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Killen, who said it took him about a decade to break into Hollywood, said he found the way communities form around different events and brands within the world of blockchain not only refreshing but also something the entertainment industry has begun to lack.
