The network <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243899\/base-mainnet-onchain-summer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">opened<\/a> for public use on the mainnet last week, and users have already bridged more than <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/tk-research\/base\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$200 million<\/a> to the network, per L2Beat data.","By saying that Coinbase cannot \u201Cland invalid output proposals,\u201D Pollak emphasized that the Base network is designed in a way that prevents even the operator \u2014 in this case, Coinbase \u2014 from unilaterally rejecting any transactions or changes that do not comply with the network\u2019s rules. \u201CThat [lack of ability to unilaterally upgrade contracts] was non-negotiable for our public launch and reflects our commitment to ensuring Base remains open, permissionless, and decentralized,\u201D Pollak added.","Pollak also likened Base to other rollup blockchains that have yet to decentralize their networks with the help of incorporating fault proofs and decentralized contract upgrades.&nbsp;\u201CThat said, like other OP chains, the current systems\u2019 upgradability and challenging authorizations are still permissioned \u2014 there\u2019s much more work to do on Base and OP Stack decentralization, particularly getting live fault proofs and safer contract upgrades,\u201D Pollak stated.","Currently, Coinbase is the sole entity operating the Base network\u2019s sequencer \u2014 a specialized node that plays a critical role in transaction ordering and data availability on a Layer 2 network. Critics say this makes it centralized. However, it\u2019s notable that almost all Layer 2 chains follow the same design.","The sequencer's ordered list of transactions is crucial, as it allows for the verification of the transaction history. While this helps allow the network to verify transactions, it may also raise concerns about centralization. Different implementations of Optimistic rollups might include measures from Coinbase to mitigate these concerns, such as decentralizing the role of the sequencer or implementing additional checks and balances.","Pollak further <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jessepollak\/status\/1690791752410468352\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> that more details regarding Base\u2019s decentralization will be shared in the coming weeks. This follows his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/240455\/coinbases-base-to-adhere-to-optimisms-open-neutrality-framework\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">comment<\/a> last month that Coinbase was committed to implementing decentralization for the Base network.","© 2023 The Block.
