OFAC is a sanctions office within the U.S. Treasury Department.","For several years, Kraken processed $1.7 million in transactions for users who appeared to be located in Iran. The 826 transactions occurred between October 2015 and June 2019. U.S. companies are banned from doing business in Iran.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Although Kraken had anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs in place, the crypto firm did not implement appropriate geolocation tools, including a system to block internet protocol addresses, OFAC said.

The firm also hired a dedicated head of sanctions to direct its compliance efforts.&nbsp;","The settlement amount \"reflects OFAC\u2019s determination that Kraken\u2019s apparent violations were non-egregious and voluntarily self-disclosed,\" the agency said. The agreement comes two months after Kraken CEO Jesse Powell <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/171847\/krakens-jesse-powell-stepping-down-as-ceo-of-crypto-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stepped down<\/span><\/a> from his role.","Kraken may not be the last crypto firm to face scrutiny for its business dealings in sanctioned countries.
