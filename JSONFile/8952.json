Being active in communities can also lead to job opportunities. For example, last year Danny Greene, the general manager for the MeebitsDAO, took a position as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162020\/meebitsdao-general-manager-to-join-yuga-labs-as-meebits-brand-lead\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meebits brand lead<\/a> at Yuga Labs.","But working with influencers to push projects and attract more retail investors has its critics, especially when a project doesn\u2019t even have a full product yet. Retail investors have been burned investing in NFTs and tokens linked to over-hyped projects that failed to deliver.","\u201CA lot of these projects plainly require a constant inflow of new suckers to prop up the prices of these tokens or NFTs or whatever the project is centered around,\u201D software engineer Molly White, who runs crypto critic site Web3 is Going Great, told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2022\/jul\/08\/nft-vibes-managers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Guardian<\/a> in July last year.","She described such attempts at fostering community as an \u201Cinsidious weaponization of the idea of community.\u201D","The role isn\u2019t the only-community focused job Darewise is currently hiring for. It\u2019s also looking for a head of community that will work on developing and implementing community-building strategies and build relationships with key community members and influencers.","The Ethereum Foundation, Binance, Polygon are also among those looking to fill community-focused roles, according to crypto job board Degen Crypto Jobs.&nbsp;","Darewise did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
