The project will make use of AMD\u2019s Alveo U55C and U250 adaptable accelerator cards to enhance capacity for secure cross-chain messages using zero-knowledge proofs.","As a bridge solution connecting over 30 blockchains, Wormhole has embraced the integration of zero-knowledge proofs into the platform. It is developing \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/mta-sts.theblock.co\/post\/231139\/near-protocol-to-use-wormhole-bridge-for-cross-chain-transfers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">light client<\/a>\u201D implementations for secure transfers across different chains, using ZKPs. The goal is to create secure \u201Ccorridors\u201D between blockchains for messaging.","However, this necessitates substantial compute power for the generation and verification of proofs across networks. That\u2019s where the AMD chips come into the picture. These FPGA chips are widely used for compute-heavy tasks like training machine learning models. Wormhole is optimizing its platform for AMD chips.","\"AMD plays a critical role in this effort by providing enterprise-grade FPGA and GPU hardware and lending deep hardware expertise to Wormhole ZK engineers to ensure efficiency and speed,\u201D said Dan Reecer, co-founder and chief operating officer at Wormhole Foundation.","AMD\u2019s contribution to the project extends beyond hardware provision \u2014 it will also share its expertise in hardware acceleration to improve the scalability of applications developed within the Wormhole ecosystem.","In the coming months, organizations contributing to Wormhole will start rolling out mainnet deployments of various zero-knowledge (ZK) light clients. Just last week, Wormhole revealed a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WormholeFdn\/status\/1758174464150553045\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">collaboration with Succinct Labs<\/a>, to enhance the development and performance of an Ethereum-based ZK light client.","Wormhole\u2019s plan is to create secure communication channels across major blockchains, including Ethereum, Near, Solana, Aptos, Sui, and Cosmos. Scaling concerning proof generation and verification in the light clients will be facilitated through AMD devices.","Wormhole\u2019s core contributors emphasize the critical importance of its product security. This stance stems from an incident in February 2022, when a security breach facilitated by a signature verification flaw in the Wormhole network on Solana led to the theft of over $320 million in ETH. Fortunately, the compromised funds were later recovered.","According to the contributors, ZK-based light clients will significantly contribute to improving the project\u2019s security and decentralization.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
