While Signature and Silvergate were \"important counterparties,\" it had banking relationships with Bank of New York and others.","In fact, Galaxy had its single largest volume days in customer franchise that weekend, Novogratz said.","\"We took advantage in lots of ways of that disconnect,\" he said. \"We provided liquidity where others weren't willing to provide liquidity. And we made a whole lot of money over that weekend.\"","Novogratz sees the current regulatory environment as an \"assault\" on crypto that will drive businesses and people offshore.","\"This regulation by 1,000 cuts is damaging,\" he said.","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last week said that it was&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222084\/sec-investigating-coinbase-for-its-earn-product-wallet-service-and-exchange-activity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">investigating Coinbase<\/a> and on Monday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced it was&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/223015\/cftc-sues-binance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suing the biggest crypto exchange, Binance<\/a>, for allegedly violating U.S. laws.&nbsp;","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222443\/coinbase-ceo-says-sec-risks-us-financial-leadership\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong<\/a> has been vocal about U.S. regulation and has said he's \"happy to go to court\" if needed.","\"I appreciate Brian Armstrong taking the fight public,\" Novogratz said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
