This fork caused an obscure code path that left validators unable to switch back to the main fork. Stakewiz suggested the Solana network\u2019s failure to rectify the situation could be due to a failed node failover setup.","A decision was made to restart the network from 153139220, the last confirmed slot. The restart was completed at 7 a.m. UTC. Dapps are working to restore services.","Despite promoting itself as a high-performance blockchain, Solana has suffered a <a href=\"https:\/\/status.solana.com\/history?page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">series of outages<\/a> over the last year. In September 2021, it went offline for almost 18 hours.","It also froze for about seven hours in early May until validators restarted, and was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/149698\/solana-blockchain-suffers-new-network-outage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">knocked offline<\/a> for about four hours in June.
