It said James \u201Ccynically cherry-picks fragments of statements and sound bites\u201D of YouTube videos made to reassure investors.","\u201CThe Earn accounts at issue were not securities under well-established law and the Complaint fails to plead adequately the existence of securities or commodities in Celsius\u2019 business model,\u201D the filing said. Mashinsky's filing also disputes James\u2019 claims the company should have been registered with the state as a dealer in financial instruments.","In January, James said Mashinsky used \u201Cfalse and misleading representations\u201D to induce customers to deposit billions of dollars, promising high yields from loans said to be of low risk, via YouTube videos and other promotional material.","Also in January, Shoba Pillay, an independent examiner appointed as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, found the company\u2019s business model \u201Cdiffered significantly\u201D from what it told customers, and that Mashinsky\u2019s claim to always have 200% collateral was \u201Cfar off the mark.\u201D","Mashinsky resigned as CEO in September and is the subject of legal action to recover funds that Celsius and its creditors say were fraudulently transferred.","Read more: Former Celsius CEO Mashinsky Sued by New York State for Defrauding Investors","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Letitia James","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"LLC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Celsius Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"James","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alex Mashinsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"200%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"New York State","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"James \u201C","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"September","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Shoba Pillay","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mashinsky","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Alex Mashinsky","Celsius","Bankruptcy","Fraud","New York Attorney General","New York","Legal"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
