As Bitmain S19 XPs get delivered to mining farms they will replace lower-efficiency machines, increasing network hashrate.\"","Parallel to this, as some miners liquidate hardware amid the bear market, those machines are coming offline and being sent to new locations, according to Vera. \"This is a temporary disruption of network hashrate, as these machines find a new home.\"","One bitcoin miner that has made headlines for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/168193\/bitcoin-miner-cleanspark-bought-10000-asics-at-a-significantly-discounted-price\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acquiring machines<\/a> and facilities from other operators in the past few months is CleanSpark.
