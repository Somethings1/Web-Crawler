The agency has yet to approve a spot product, and has in the past cited concerns of manipulation in the underlying spot market.&nbsp;","Advocates for a spot ETF have argued that futures-based ETFs also relies on pricing from underlying spot exchange venues. The recent round of filings identify partnerships with Coinbase for market surveillance to potentially mollify that concern.&nbsp;","\"In other countries there are spot products that have been approved for a long time and there's a lot of demand for spot products and I think if you look at the rationale for approving a futures product, it would seem that you could apply that same rationale and apply it a spot product,\" Peirce commented.&nbsp;","Furthermore, the Commissioner added that \"regulatory ambiguity\" stemming from the SEC is not beneficial to Americans.&nbsp;","\"I know there are a lot of people who are very critical of the SEC, and I'm quite critical often of my own agency as well,\" she said. \"And I think one of the reasons that I've been critical and that some others have been critical is that in the absence of a regulatory framework that makes sense.\"","That ambiguity might force companies or projects to spend unnecessary timing weighing options to leave the U.S., comply, or shut down entirely.&nbsp;","\"I don't think that it serves the American public to keep this sort of regulatory ambiguity so that you can come in after the fact with enforcement,\" she said. \"Why not have some regulatory clarity?\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
