Qualified institutional buyers are financially sophisticated entities, like banks and investment firms, with significant assets \u2014 allowing them to trade securities that may not be registered with the SEC.&nbsp;<\/span>","RDC, which also has backing from BTIG and Broadhaven Ventures, added that the BTC DRs follow the same construction as American Depositary Receipts, which represent shares of foreign stocks issued by banks. ADRs are traded on U.S. stock exchanges in U.S. dollars, making it easier for American investors to buy and sell shares of foreign companies.","\u201CWe are excited to provide qualified institutional buyers with the secure, regulated access to digital assets they have been waiting for via BTC DRs,\u201D RDC co-founder and CEO Ankit Mehta said. \u201CThere are many benefits to using depositary receipts, such as their tried and true structure, providing direct ownership of the underlying asset and easy inclusion in institutional products. BTC DRs are universally fungible as QIBs can convert their bitcoin holdings into DRs and vice versa.\u201D&nbsp;","Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions is acting as the SEC-registered transfer agent for RDC, and the federally chartered digital asset bank Anchorage Digital will provide custody in a bankruptcy remote structure \u2014 mitigating counterparty credit risk from the issuing depositary. This setup ensures that the DRs are 100% backed by bitcoin held in custody and cannot be lent, re-hypothecated or pledged, the firm said.","The BTC DRs operate within U.S. regulated market infrastructure and are cleared via The Depository Trust Company, enabling qualified investors to own bitcoin using the same technology, workflows and counterparty relationships they use for traditional securities, RDC added.","\u201CThe RDC team has some of the strongest talent available in the highly technical world of depositary receipts,\u201D Anchorage Digital president and co-founder Diogo Mónica said. \u201CWith the underlying BTC safely stored via institutional-grade custody at Anchorage Digital Bank, we\u2019re excited to help bring BTC to the securities ecosystem.\u201D","While BTC DRs are RDC\u2019s first offering, the company said it was also able to create clearinghouse-eligible securities for other alternative assets.","The crypto industry has been vying for a spot bitcoin ETF for years, with Franklin Templeton also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/250478\/franklin-templeton-files-with-sec-for-spot-bitcoin-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">joining<\/a> the race in September among a current total of 14 asset managers \u2014 including BlackRock, Fidelity, Valkyrie and VanEck \u2014 hoping to finally win SEC approval.","Dubbed the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1992870\/000113743923001074\/ftdhts1092023.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Franklin Bitcoin ETF<\/a>, the fund's assets would consist primarily of bitcoin held in custody by Coinbase Custody Trust Company.
