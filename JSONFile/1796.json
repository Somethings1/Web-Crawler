Atomic swaps are slow and cause the counterparties to be illiquid for an extended period of time and create a \u201Cfree option\u201D problem due to the length of the timelock variable that extends well beyond initial price discovery.&nbsp; Atomic Swaps using HTLCs can actually have some counterparty risk because of how the \u201Cshared secret\u201D allows for assets on both sides to be withdrawn, which, when coupled with the timelock expiry, could result in one of the counterparties withdrawing both assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While this may be acceptable for one-off trades between technically sophisticated individuals that are willing to take certain risks, institutional and high-frequency trading must operate at much higher velocity without physically moving assets on Layer 1 for each trading transaction, and without such risks.&nbsp; Layer 2 solutions seek to address this problem, but implementations vary widely and generally are pegged to a particular public ledger protocol, usually Ethereum, and may not be suitable for certain use cases.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bosonic.digital\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bosonic Network™<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is a permissioned multi-custodian Layer 2 blockchain network that makes it possible to tokenize any asset a custodian holds on behalf of their clients, whether non-natively digital like Fiat currencies or natively digital like Crypto.&nbsp; This type of Layer 2 network maintains cryptographic provability of the underlying assets and the ownership chain, much like a Layer 1 public blockchain protocol does, but with extremely high-performance Atomic Exchange that is integrated into traditional trading technology.&nbsp; Because of how the Layer 2 is architected, it can bridge between assets that are not natively digital and all Layer 1 protocols.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An Atomic Exchange on the Bosonic Network is implemented as follows:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Trades are therefore <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bosonic.digital\/product\/3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Payment vs. Payment (PvP)<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> with clearing and settlement happening in real time, with no counterparty credit or settlement risk, and with full net settlement automation.&nbsp; One critical thing to note is that because of this unique implementation, Bosonic does not need to custody client assets.&nbsp; Delivery vs Payment (DvP) settlement systems require that either (1) the party performing the DvP service custody assets for both sides of the trade for the trading parties (e.g., Paxos) or (2) that one counterparty must make payment first for what is to be delivered, which usually requires some sort of intermediary to use their balance sheet to guarantee the counterparties against loss (e.g., a Prime Broker using balance sheet).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Bosonic Network also bridges clients with assets held at brick-and-mortar custodians with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bosonic.digital\/product\/11\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">clients who self-custody<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> using various wallet technologies, e.g., Fireblocks or MetaMask Institutional, by leveraging Layer 1 Smart Contracts secured by the Ethereum network to transact on ETH and the full range of ERC-20 tokens, as well as leveraging RSK for Smart Contracts that transact BTC and are secured by the Bitcoin network.&nbsp; By tokenizing assets locked in Layer 1 Smart Contracts onto the Layer 2 blockchain network, Atomic Exchange of assets is still executed at high frequency without the cost and slowness of moving assets on Layer 1 public ledgers.&nbsp; Layer 1 public ledger movements are only necessary for periodic net settlement movements based on the business requirements of the custodians and the clients.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In conclusion, for institutional trading of Fiat and Crypto with no counterparty credit or settlement risk, and the highest velocity of capital and capital efficiency, you need high performance Atomic Exchange of value.&nbsp;
