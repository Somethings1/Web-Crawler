The index has amassed over $1 billion in assets under management since its launch in 2019.&nbsp;","The transaction, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.co.uk\/news-releases\/coinshares-to-acquire-global-blockchain-equity-index-809699538.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced this morning<\/a>, will be settled through an equity swap, for which CoinShares will issue 1,298,322 new ordinary shares at a price of $13.09 per share.
