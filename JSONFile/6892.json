Options were also reported as becoming the go-to instrument for institutional players entering crypto.","\u201CWe are seeing growth from flows of institutional investors into crypto derivatives. CME crypto options had a great month in July, the highest in three months, with a significant pickup in ETH volumes. Deribit has continued to hit comparatively high monthly volume totals,\u201D Gordon Grant, managing director of sales and trading at Genesis, told The Block.","He added that the CME is seen as a putatively more stable venue for some top-tier institutional investors than traditional, crypto-native exchanges. \u201CThey are less excited about interacting with mainstay crypto exchanges than with the perceived stability of the CME. Institutional investors, especially the largest global allocators, see the CME as having a brand associated with safety and reliability,\u201D Grant added.","Grant also pointed to the new products being rolled out for institutional investors to participate in crypto markets, such as the CME\u2019s newly released ETH\/BTC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/242023\/cme-bitcoin-futures-monthly-yearly-high\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ratio futures<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232067\/deribit-nears-expiry-of-3-6-billion-in-options\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Deribit\u2019s<\/a> volatility futures.","In contrast, the Genesis MD added that Coinbase\u2019s futures volumes are still nascent. He also highlighted Kraken\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244348\/kraken-outpaces-coinbase-as-most-liquid-us-exchange-for-altcoins-kaiko\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">attempt<\/a> to get into the futures space, where, so far, they \u201Cwere not able to see a critical mass.\u201D","Contrasting this growth of derivative volumes, spot market liquidity is suffering. \u201CThe spot order book depth is chronically flagging,\u201D the report added. Grant links the drying up of liquidity in spot markets to \u201Con and off-ramp difficulties with spot exchanges in different jurisdictions.\"","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
