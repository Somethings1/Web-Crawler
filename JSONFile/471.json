Investors will be vigilant for signals of another rate increase in 2023.","\"A hawkish tone will surely be perceived as negative for crypto assets whereas a neutral tone could set the base of the expectation of the end of the hiking cycle. The latter, if confirmed, will have an unambiguous positive impact in crypto asset prices, in our view,\" Yellati added.","The world's largest digital asset by market capitalization has jumped back from languishing in a three-month low, with bitcoin's price climbing 2.6% over the past day to $27,217 at 1:00 p.m. ET, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinGecko<\/a>."],"hashtag":["BITCOIN","CRYPTO MOVERS","RATE DECISIONS"]}
