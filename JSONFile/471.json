It aims to improve data privacy in the home space by letting users hold on to their own keys through a hardware wallet. The goal, according to HTC decentralized chief officer Phil Chen, is to challenge the dominance of smart devices produced by big tech companies \u2013 Amazon Alexa, Google Nest, Facebook, etc. \u2013 that leave users\u2019 private data vulnerable.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CToday, whenever any app says they\u2019re using end-to-end encryption, they\u2019re using a software key to secure your data or transmission of messages,\u201D Chen told The Block. \"And when you use a software key, that means the key is on the operating system and the cloud companies have access to it.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAlmost every other day, you see another hack, beach, or misuse of data...from emails and credit score to health data and private search data,\u201D he continued.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The blockchain router tries to address this vulnerability by allowing users to run a full bitcoin node through Zion vault, HTC's hardware-backed key management platform. Users will be able to relay transactions independent of any third party. At the same time, each user is contributing to the security of the whole network by helping relay transactions made by others.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Exodus is known for its blockchain smartphone. The first model, EXODUS 1, was released in December 2018. The company subsequently launched EXODUS 1s, a smartphone capable of running a full bitcoin node, and EXODUS 1-BINANCE, a limited edition phone with built-in support of Binance\u2019s native blockchain.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CHaving crypto in a smartphone is crucial to mass adoption,\u201D Chen said. The router device, on the other hand, addresses a different type of consumer need and focuses on the home space.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe home is this temple of privacy. But right now, because of convenience, we\u2019re using voice systems and cameras, so our home is very susceptible to being hacked,\" he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EXODUS 5G Hub has integrated with a number of privacy apps such as email service ProtonMail, open-source Internet browser Brave, decentralized VPN Incognito. The company has also partnered with other ecosystem players, including Binance and decentralized finance (DeFi) products like Compound and Uniswap, according to Chen.<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
