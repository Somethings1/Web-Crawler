This is not a very in-the-box moment,\u201D says Rostin Behnam, who chairs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.","Behnam was speaking at DC Fintech Week, during which he addressed the CFTC's recent blitz to get more regulatory authority in crypto.","Of this push, Behnam explained: \"What I\u2019ve advocated for and what I\u2019ve asked Congress for is very clearly spot authority over commodity tokens.\u201D","He further reiterated his belief that ether as well as bitcoin are commodities. In a recent report the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a supercommittee of U.S. financial regulators, recommended Congress pass legislation to allow more direct regulation of cryptocurrencies defined as commodities.","The CFTC currently only has jurisdiction over derivatives and futures markets, rather than power over the immediate spot markets that contain a majority of the investment into bitcoin and ether.&nbsp;","Alongside this push, the CFTC has been touting its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174081\/cftc-brings-action-against-digitex-futures\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">enforcement activity in crypto<\/a>.
