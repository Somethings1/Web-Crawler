The transition incorporated developments across multiple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222898\/dydx-private-testnet-cosmos-blockchain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">testnets<\/a> during this year.","\"After years of development, 5 testnets involving 60+ validators and top tier trading firms, the dYdX Chain has been officially launched by the community and DAO,\" Charles d\u2019Haussy, CEO of the dYdX Foundation, told The Block. \"This marks a monumental leap forward for the dYdX Ecosystem representing a new chapter that\u2019s defined by full decentralization.\"","Built on the Cosmos SDK, the alpha version introduces an independent blockchain tailored to accommodate the project's requirements. This development follows the recent public <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/258906\/dydx-trading-ships-code-for-version-4-of-its-cosmos-based-dex?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">release<\/a> of the open-source code for the dYdX blockchain.","At this alpha stage, the mainnet aims primarily to stress-test the network. It's in the process of onboarding over 60 validators to ensure network security. A subsequent beta launch is planned, pending approval from a community governance vote, that will eventually enable trading on the network.","In today\u2019s initial phase, validators for dYdX will enroll by submitting a genesis file, as <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CosmostationVD\/status\/1717514254272852301\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> by Cosmos-based development firm Cosmostation, which intends to operate a dYdX validator.","DYdX's version 3 leverages StarkEx, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution.
