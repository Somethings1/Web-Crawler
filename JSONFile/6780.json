With three years of being a regulated entity, LCX is set to benefit from an expedited application process for MiCA. The MiCA framework has incorporated a fast-track process for all Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) that have been previously regulated, making LCX's transition smoother.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The MiCA regulations, proposed by the European Commission, aim to establish a comprehensive framework for crypto assets and related services, ensuring consumer protection, and promoting fair market competition.
