The $40 million paid in bitcoin by the Chicago-based insurance company CNA Financial represents 57.7% of that total.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As the use of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has grown, so has their popularity among ransomware groups, since they offer a different level of risk than using traditional banking methods, which generally allow for the seizure of funds. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The top crypto ransomware payments have been identified in a new <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/immunefi.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> from the web3-focused bug bounty platform <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/199872\/crypto-losses-in-2022-total-3-9-billion-immunefi-report-says\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Immunefi<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, connected to eight specific malware strains.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JBS, CWT, Brenntag, Colonial Pipeline, Travelex, UCSF, BRB Bank, Jackson County and the University of Maastricht join CNA Financial in the top 10, with ransom payments ranging from $218,000 to $40 million.

In total, those recoveries make up just 3.6% of the top crypto ransomware payments.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Immunefi\u2019s report, researchers detected eight specific malware strains related to the ransom payments. Ransomware-as-a-Service operators REvil\/Sodinokibi and Darkside were the most used. Phoenix CryptoLocker, a variant of the ransomware family released by Russian-based cybercriminal group Evil Corp, was the most profitable and was behind the extortion of CNA Financial.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To protect from ransomware attacks, Immunefi recommended that organizations ensure they have extensive and regular backups of vital data and a recovery plan for restoration in the event of an attack. It also suggested keeping systems and applications up to date, training staff on common phishing techniques and using intrusion detection and antivirus software.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite the wide range of crypto assets now available, bitcoin was the currency of choice for the ransomware groups, likely due to its recognizability and accessibility, according to Immunefi.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous rather than anonymous and can be tracked by combining blockchain analytics with other data, with a growing industry of on-chain specialists like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/204471\/ransomware-crypto-revenue-declines-as-victims-refuse-to-pay-chainalysis\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and Elliptic finding connections between bitcoin addresses and real-world entities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, ransomware groups are correct that the decentralized nature of crypto can facilitate larger payments due to the challenges of transferring millions of dollars through the legacy banking system without being caught.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In terms of cashing out into fiat currency, the report suggests ransomware groups use centralized exchanges with fake IDs, private OFAC-sanctioned exchanges or government connections in jurisdictions that do not cooperate with foreign subpoenas.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alternatives to fiat off-ramps include using bitcoin directly to purchase goods and services, trying to obfuscate funds via a crypto mixer or swapping assets between blockchains.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Decentralized applications are also an attractive target to malicious actors keen to exploit weaknesses in blockchain-based protocols.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Immunefi has come to dominate crypto bug bounty rewards as a result <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u2014<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> paying out over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/197424\/ethical-crypto-hackers-win-52-million-in-bug-bounties-via-immunefi-in-2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$52 million<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to ethical hackers for finding vulnerabilities in web3 protocols last year.
