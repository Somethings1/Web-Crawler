We have implemented all necessary restrictions for UK users and partnered with an FCA authorized firm, <a href=\"http:\/\/rebuildingsociety.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rebuildingsociety.com<\/a> Limited, in order to meet our obligations.\"","\"We shared our agreement with <a href=\"http:\/\/rebuildingsociety.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rebuildingsociety.com<\/a> with the FCA on Oct. 2, almost a full week before the requirements of the updated Financial Promotions Regime came into effect,\" the spokesperson continued. \"The FCA issued warnings against more than 140 firms for breaches of the Financial Promotions Regime since it was updated on Oct. 8. That Binance is not among these firms is testament to the processes and procedures it has implemented to comply with requirements.\"","The FCA's new regime for crypto asset financial promotions took effect on Oct. 8. Entities already registered or authorized by the FCA can approve financial promotions on behalf of unregulated firms, like Binance.","The regulator said unregistered crypto asset firms who fail to comply with the new financial promotions guidelines are likely to be in breach of section 21 of the UK's Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. This would be a criminal offense, punishable by up to two years imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
