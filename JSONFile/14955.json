The Nuances of Valuing NFTs","category":["Web3"],"content":["Last week, the floor price of popular non-fungible token (NFT) collection Bored Ape Yacht Club fell below 30 ETH, sinking to a 20-month low. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly why the collection\u2019s floor price has dropped so dramatically, though it\u2019s likely due to a combination of factors \u2013 there\u2019s been a broader cooldown in the NFT market that has impacted many of the top NFT collections and an extended crypto winter has affected the price of Ethereum, which powers most NFT collections.","The fact that BAYC \u2013 long ranked as one of the top collections across NFT marketplaces \u2013 has experienced such a steep decline in floor price has some critics knocking it as a fall from grace.","One popular tweet circulating on Twitter singled out a Bored Ape NFT acquired by Justin Beiber in January 2022 for $1.3 million. According to the tweet, the Ape is now only worth about $59,000. Media quickly picked it up and labeled it a loss for Bieber, who has not yet sold the NFT.","As it turns out, determining the value of an NFT is slightly more nuanced than that. While floor price is a helpful metric that indicates the lowest price a seller wants for an NFT in a given collection, it often does not reflect every NFT in a 10,000-edition collection.","There are many factors that go into determining how valuable an NFT is, according to industry experts. There\u2019s the floor price, which best reflects the perceived value of the most basic NFTs in a collection. And then there\u2019s the price of Ethereum, which can fluctuate greatly on a given day. But there are also individual factors that make one NFT more valuable than its neighbor, including its cultural significance, its rarity ranking and a collector\u2019s personal affiliation to the asset.","Many generative art NFT collections have embedded rarity traits. This is why collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks have become so popular as profile pictures (PFPs) on social networks like Twitter \u2013 showing off a rare PFP carries the same social significance as owning an expensive handbag.","\u201CRarity traits refer to unique characteristics of an NFT, such as limited edition releases, exclusive features or special attributes,\u201D Oliver Cohen, president of NFT analytics tool Inspect, told CoinDesk. \u201CThese traits contribute to the perceived scarcity and desirability of an NFT, which can affect its value.\u201D","Deep NFT Value is a tool that uses machine learning to analyze high-value NFT collections based on previous sales, current market conditions and rarity traits. Founder and CEO Nikolai Yakovenko told CoinDesk that in the case of Bored Ape Yacht Club, NFTs with \u201Cgold fur,\u201D \u201Ctrippy fur\u201D and \u201Cblue beams\u201D have historically sold for the most money and continue to be the most valuable. In addition, Apes with a combination of traits are sometimes considered to be rare and are therefore more valuable.","\u201CGenerally speaking, these traits keep their \"premium\" on the floor, as that moves,\u201D he explained, noting that as the floor price of a collection moves up or down, Apes with rare traits typically remain proportionately priced.","\u201CIf the floor price \u2013 or common Apes \u2013 goes up by 20%, then the premiums also go up by 20%,\u201D said Yakovenko. \u201CThat changes over time, but day to day you look at the historical premium and the floor price movement, since rare pieces don't trade that often but the floor price trades all day long.\u201D","Deep NFT Value\u2019s algorithm \u201Cscores\u201D an NFT in a collection based on its proportion to the floor price \u2013 for example, this Ape is estimated to be worth 4.4 times the floor price, according to its traits.","Still, Yakovenko noted that these can numbers can change due to supply and demand and depending on the market\u2019s appetite for common versus rare Apes.","\u201COf course when the model sees market signals \u2013 sales, bids and listings \u2013 that contradict our estimates, then the model adjusts,\u201D he said.","Despite dips, collectors who purchase rarer NFTs may fare better in the long term, according to Sara Gherghelas, an analyst at analytics platform DappRadar.","\"NFTs with certain rarity traits or cultural significance may retain or even increase their value despite the collection\u2019s overall decrease,\" she told CoinDesk.","The cultural significance of a particular NFT can also factor into its price. For example, in Jack Butcher\u2019s Checks VV, NFTs with notable edition numbers like #1 or #420 can sell for more than the floor price.","\u201CNFTs associated with influential artists, iconic moments or significant cultural events may carry higher value due to their historical or artistic importance,\u201D said Cohen, noting that a collection\u2019s cultural significance can fluctuate over time. \u201CIf a collection has gained significant popularity and recognition, individual tokens within that collection may see an increase in value due to the overall reputation and demand.\u201D","NFT collection Pudgy Penguins is an example of an NFT collection that recently experienced a major upswing thanks to a change in leadership.","Another example of a culturally significant NFT that sold well above its collection\u2019s floor price was Dmitri Cherniak's Ringers #879, affectionately known as \u201CThe Goose\u201D because of how closely the generative artwork resembles the bird.","The NFT, which was previously owned by liquidated hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, sold for $6.2 million at auction last month \u2013 far higher than the collection\u2019s floor price of 44.5 ETH, or about $75,000 at the time, according to data from OpenSea.","The fact that the NFT was previously owned by a major hedge fund may have also boosted the hype around its sale, though Yakovenko said that prior ownership does not factor into Deep NFT Value's algorithm.","\u201CWe do not factor in the ownership history of an Ape \u2013 unless it's been stolen,\u201D he said. \u201CThere's no evidence that users pay a premium for that, unlike, say, jewelry worn by celebrities.\u201D","When looking at an NFT collection as a whole, floor price is helpful in conveying how popular a project is at a given point in time. OpenSea defines the floor price as \u201Cthe lowest price for collection items, rather than the average item price,\u201D meaning that if you just wanted to own any NFT from a particular collection, the floor price would be your best deal. Analyzing changes to a collection\u2019s floor price over time can reflect public sentiment.","\u201CWhen the floor price drops, it can indicate a decrease in demand or saturation of supply for the collection,\u201D Cohen said. \u201CThis decrease in demand and lower perceived value of the collection as a whole can influence the value of individual tokens within the collection. Buyers may be less willing to pay a higher price for an individual token when the overall collection's value is declining.\u201D","For Bored Ape Yacht Club, this correlation rings especially true. \u201COver time, as the floor price has gone down, so has the value of the top Apes,\u201D said Yakovenko.","Knowing this information allows us to look back at Bieber\u2019s NFT purchase with a new perspective. Deep NFT Value estimates that based on its rarity traits, cultural significance and public sentiment, Ape #3001 is most likely worth roughly what the collection\u2019s floor price is.","\u201COur model sees him as a floor Ape \u2013 pretty clean \u2013 no bad features, but nothing extra valuable either,\u201D Yakovenko said, positing that the Ape sold for four to five times more than it was worth in 2022.","Other celebrities that \u201Caped\u201D into the collection during the NFT bull run may have also overvalued their NFTs. After all, BAYC once reached a floor price of 153.7 ETH in April 2022 \u2013 when public sentiment toward NFTs was sky-high.","Former NFL quarterback Tom Brady paid 133 ETH \u2013 worth about $453,000 at the time \u2013 for BAYC #3667 in April 2022. Deep NFT Value estimates that today, the NFT is worth 30.7 ETH, or about $58,000. Rapper Eminem reportedly purchased BAYC #9055 in December 2021 for 123.45 ETH, worth about $453,000 at the time. The token is currently valued at 37.97 ETH, a little over $71,000, by Deep NFT Value.","\u201CIt's important to note that the impact on individual token value can vary depending on factors such as the uniqueness of the token, its rarity traits and the overall perception of the collection's long-term potential,\u201D said Cohen.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"$59,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"January 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dmitri Cherniak","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$71,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bored Ape Yacht Club","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Yakovenko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Jack Butcher","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nikolai Yakovenko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bored Ape NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bieber\u2019s NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bieber","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tom Brady","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"PFP","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFL","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pudgy Penguins","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Yakovenko","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Oliver Cohen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT Value","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$6.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sara Gherghelas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Justin Beiber","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cohen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$58,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"December 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$453,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"#3667","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$75,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"9055","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Web3","NFT","Bored Ape","Justin bieber","Steve Aoki"],"authors":["Cam Thompson","Rosie Perper"]}
