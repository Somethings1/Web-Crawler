He called it a \"synthetic hegemonic currency.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the Fed's paper, written by economists Garth Baughman and Jean Flemming, puts the question of who should be in charge aside. Based on economic modeling, it concludes that, under certain circumstances, a hypothetical basket-backed stablecoin could contribute to a \"substantial increase\" in consumer well-being.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Baughman and Flemming created a model that included two countries, each with its own sovereign currency. They used it to test demand for a stablecoin backed by a basket containing each of those currencies.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The model showed that trade shocks \u2014 changes in a country's opportunities to trade due to external events like a change in international prices or the volume of items being traded \u2014 could affect money demand that causes fluctuations in the value of the currencies in the basket. Baughman and Flemming found that these fluctuations were likely to push consumers towards more stable payment methods, thereby increasing demand for the stablecoin.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although the digital currency may not take over its component fiat currencies in popularity, if enough sellers accept it as payment, it would have a high level of \"spendability,\" the economists said. That would lead to increased trade and potentially improve consumer welfare, they conclude.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, the model showed that overall demand for the stablecoin would be minimal. That's because the same trade shocks might make the demand of the stablecoin volatile enough to cause the demand of its component currencies to become volatile as well.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Baughman and Flemming say this would make it nearly impossible for the basket-backed stablecoin to become an internationally dominant currency, thus concluding that \"fears of a so-called global stablecoin replacing domestic sovereign currencies may be overstated.\"<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
