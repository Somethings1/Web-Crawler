It was never introduced in Parliament.&nbsp;","It is not clear what the 2021 bill's contents are. \"Need to wait till the session starts,\" Jaideep Reddy, leader of technology law practice at Nishith Desai Associates, told The Block.","The listing comes a few days after India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, several other lawmakers, as well as industry stakeholders have held meetings to discuss the crypto space, including its opportunities and challenges.","Â© 2023 The Block.
