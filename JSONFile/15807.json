In March 2021, the Canadian Securities Administrators issued a public notice informing crypto exchanges they needed to register with a securities regulator if they wanted to keep serving Canadian customers, triggering a rush to comply with regulatory requirements.","Coinsquare, however, began the long process of becoming an IIROC member before it was compelled to do so. Katriana Prokopy, Coinsquare\u2019s chief legal officer and head of regulatory affairs, told CoinDesk the exchange began pursuing regulatory approval two years ago.","As a member of IIROC, Coinsquare will undergo rigorous audits and oversight to ensure it remains in compliance with regulatory requirements \u2013 something Prokopy said could be a comfort to investors, especially in the wake of high-profile collapses of crypto exchanges, including Celsius Network.","\u201CBecoming an IIROC dealer and member of IIROC, it gives clients the security that they\u2019re dealing with an intermediary, a securities dealer, with all the sorts of protections and oversight that they\u2019re familiar with when they trade traditional assets,\u201D Prokopy said. \u201CAnd, heretofore, that has not been the case.\u201D","There is, however, one important bit of coverage Coinsquare\u2019s clients won\u2019t get through its IIROC membership \u2013 protection of their crypto assets from the exchange\u2019s potential insolvency.","Members of IIROC automatically become members of the Canadian Investor Protection Fund, which offers limited protection for property held by a member fund on behalf of investors if the member becomes insolvent. However, in Coinsquare\u2019s case, CIPF will only apply to fiat held in customer\u2019s accounts in case Coinsquare goes in the way of Celsius.","Prokopy said she hopes CIPF\u2019s coverage will eventually change to include crypto.","\u201CLike the regulatory framework generally, CIPF coverage is evolving. In time, we hope to push the envelope on that and be part of the conversation in which [CIPF] evolves to cover crypto assets as well,\u201D Prokopy said. \u201CBut that is not the case today from a CIPF perspective.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Toronto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Prokopy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"fiat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"today","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Canadian Securities Administrators","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinsquare","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2021","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Coinsquare","Canada"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
