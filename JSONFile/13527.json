Trust is eroded and, questions are raised about whether the asset class really does have a long-term sustainable future.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whilst this is clearly another setback for the retail segment of the crypto marketplace, we remain convinced that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will pervade traditional capital markets from an institutional perspective.
