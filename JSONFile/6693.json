Instead, according to the investor, he is the one that is owed money.","\"This counter-party owes me a substantial sum of money, and I am currently seeking the return of my funds,\" Ver said.","Last week, CoinFLEX&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/153871\/coinflex-halts-withdrawals-amid-extreme-market-conditions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">paused all withdrawals from users<\/a>, citing market conditions and \"continued uncertainty involving a counterparty.\"","On Monday the company announced that it was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/154468\/coinflex-plans-new-token-to-raise-funds-days-after-halting-withdrawals\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launching a new token<\/a> called Recovery Value USD (rvUSD) \u2014 curiously with the same initials as Ver.
