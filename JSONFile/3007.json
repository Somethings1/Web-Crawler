Users purchasing the tokens can either redeem them later to receive the items, or trade them on the secondary market. Artists can also benefit from this trading process by collecting the transaction fee that the platform charges for each trade.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Foundation\u2019s first sale will be for a new clothing label, Neue Goods, which was created by co-founder Matthew Vernon. A total of six items will be for sale, including three T-shirts and three \"mystery items\" that will be revealed in the future. The company also has several designers lined up for future sales, including internet artist Addie Wagenknecht, 80\u2019s-style webpage radio station <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/7\/26\/8931651\/poolside-fm-website-retro-summer-80s-soundcloud-playlist\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Poolside.FM<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;and furniture designer Studio Zollo.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The San Francisco startup is led by Vernon along with Kayvon Tehranian and Elpizo Choi.
