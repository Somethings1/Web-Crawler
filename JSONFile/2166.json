Crypto news in the past week saw a continuation of some familiar as well as new trends. Some of the notable items included Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter, Meta\u2019s dwindling financials, Google\u2019s foray into Ethereum blockchain node services as well the severe impact of the crypto market on venture funds. To summarize, here are the stories that got us talking last week:&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Elon Musk<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/180725\/musk-at-last-takes-over-twitter-reports\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">completed<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> the Twitter acquisition deal. The tech entrepreneur and Tesla CEO took the reins at Twitter as well, entering the firm's headquarters with what appeared to be a bathroom sink. The billionaire even changed his Twitter bio to \"Chief Twit.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After trying to back out of the deal in July and being sued by Twitter, Musk reversed his position last month, saying that he did indeed want to move forward with the acquisition. Still, Musk\u2019s takeover comes at a time when the microblogging platform is struggling to keep its most active users, according to a Reuters <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179802\/twitter-struggling-to-keep-its-most-active-users-reuters\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a>.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A<\/span> major <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/180752\/binance-confirmed-as-investor-in-twitter-takeover-as-musk-reportedly-plans-to-take-reins-as-ceo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">revelation<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> regarding this deal came with Binance, the biggest crypto exchange by volume, saying it's now a part owner at Twitter.
