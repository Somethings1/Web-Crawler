However, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ethereumpow\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">EthereumPoW's Geth code on GitHub shows no commits<\/a> \u2014 a software development term for how a code update is confirmed and implemented \u2014 in over seven months.","That apparent lack of action drew criticism yesterday from Bob Summerwill, the executive director at ETC Cooperative, who <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BobSummerwill\/status\/1651693294781607938\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a>: \"That such a low-effort affinity project has over $300 million market tells us how little 'signal' there is in price.\"","ETC Cooperative is the primary contributing team behind the original Ethereum fork that resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic in 2016 and serves as a competitor to EthereumPoW.&nbsp;","One EthereumPoW coin is currently trading under $3.
