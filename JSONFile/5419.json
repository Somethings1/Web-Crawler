Token holders will be entitled to 15% of all his income for the next three years, capped at $100,000. The dividends will be distributed to shareholders on a quarterly basis in the form of DAI or an equivalent stablecoin.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Masmej told The Block that the income-sharing model has been in existence for years, but not so much through cryptocurrency or on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/gap-between-bitcoin-and-ethereum-transaction-volumes-narrows-as-stablecoin-demand-soars-34564\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum<\/a> network.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to him, adding the crypto element to the model brings benefits like increased transparency, secondary trading through Uniswap, and the utility aspect extended to token holders.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The $ALEX tokens already have approximately 200 token holders on Uniswap. In addition to a guaranteed percentage of Masmej's future income, they will also receive additional utilities like one-on-one sessions with Masmej, access to his network, and possible participation in the seed round of his next startup.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The tech startup that Masmej promises to spend the fresh funds on is still in the idea stage, but he revealed that it would be a DeFi project focused on saving accounts.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"In this time of crisis, people want to save money and care less about crypto native experiments,\" he said. \"Right now savings seems to me like the most needed crypto product that is better than traditional finance.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The tokenization of human capital has recently emerged as a popular new asset class.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Last year, designer Matthew Vernon \u2013 nicknamed \"Dapp Boi\" \u2013 issued 100 $BOI tokens representing 100 hours of his time.

But generally speaking, he believes that the model of personal tokens will soon gain more traction as a growing number of people are affected by the ongoing pandemic and start to look for new, innovative ways to raise funds.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"I'm affected by the crisis. I'm making less money. So this is what I found to bring myself up and turn this crisis into an opportunity for myself,\" he said. \"I think this is going to be very popular because people would need to be on the payroll.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"I think that the personal tokens space is super unsaturated right now,\" he continued. \"But we'll see a new wave of freelancer and entrepreneur doing this. Ever since I announced the fundraise for the person last week, I've been contacted by many people wanting to create their own personal tokens.

The long term value of $ALEX will likely come from them as opposed to the creator (Alex Masmej).\"","\"Our goal is really to build tools and features that grow this type of utility over time across platforms,\" he added.","Â© 2023 The Block.
