The average check size of its investments would range between $500,000 and $5 million, said Filia.","As for a rough mix of crypto and fintech focus, Filia said the fund would invest about 60% of the total capital in fintech startups and the rest in crypto and web3 firms.","Filia said it has already invested in two web3 startups: Twig, a London-based fintech that plans to develop a blockchain-based payment infrastructure, and Scuti, a gaming store looking to issue a gaming reward token.","Founded in 2011, Fasanara says it has more than $3.5 billion in assets under management and employs more than 150 people.","Fasanara's raise comes as venture capital investment in the crypto space has skyrocketed over the past few months. Last month, there was the highest number of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/145455\/april-crypto-funding-roundup-vc-highest-deals\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">funding deals<\/a> in crypto's history.
