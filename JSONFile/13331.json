Now, as part of the product development team, Sommer and Ramalho Carlos will help integrate the software into eToro\u2019s platform. A calendar feature is already live and a tool that gives traders a way to monitor their portfolios outside of market hours is due to launch soon. Additional features include a personalized news feed linked to the assets in a user\u2019s portfolio.","\u201CIt\u2019s the wisdom of the crowd in action,\u201D said Yoni Assia, eToro\u2019s co-founder and CEO, in a statement. \u201CWe believe there is a power in shared knowledge and that by transforming investing into a group effort we yield better results and become more successful together. João and Filipe share this ethos.\u201D","With headquarters in Tel Aviv, Israel, eToro has been around since 2007, and today counts more than 30 million registered users on its platform.","The company looked <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/98431\/etoro-public-merger-blank-check-company\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">set to go public<\/a> last year, amid the Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) frenzy, through a merger with Fintech Acquisition Corp.
