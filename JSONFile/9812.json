That marks the fourth consecutive month of declining venture funding volumes in the space \u2014&nbsp;and the lowest monthly volume figure recorded since January 2021.","","","\"I think people mistake the 'napkin math' amount of dry powder out there for a need and desire for VCs to deploy that the same way they did in 2021 - 2022,\" said Tom Schmidt, managing partner at crypto VC firm Dragonfly.","\"VCs are being more judicious and slower in deployment and trying to pick up the few good companies that are rising to the top \u2014 many companies that raised massive amounts at crazy valuations that they haven't grown into aren't fundable in 2023 without totally reworking the cap table or adding so much structure to the round that it simply isn't worth it. Pre-seed and seed still seems to be healthy, but that's a relatively small segment of the market,\" he added.","It\u2019s not only in crypto that startups are having trouble securing venture cash. Except for a few red-hot sectors, such as artificial intelligence, venture funding levels have fallen dramatically this year. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/venture\/global-vc-funding-falls-q1-2023\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A Crunchbase report<\/a> in April found that total VC investment in the first quarter of the year came in at $76 billion&nbsp;\u2014 down from $162 billion in the same period of 2022.","While the environment in crypto is particularly harsh, thanks to a prolonged bear market marked by the collapses of multiple marquee startups in the space over the past year, a few later-stage rounds have bucked the trend this year.
