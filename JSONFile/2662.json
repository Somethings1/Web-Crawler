Ethereum and Solana were prioritized for the ETPs due to strong demand from some of Figment\u2019s largest customers, Figment CEO Lorien Gabel told The Block.","\u201COur goal is to be the go-to staking option for institutions managing crypto-assets, offering seamless access through custodians, exchanges and portfolio management systems,\" Gabel said. \"While we remain open to exploring other networks with our partners, our current focus is on optimizing the ETPs for ETH and SOL.\u201D","\u201CThe popularity and interest in ETH and SOL has increased substantially over the past few months,\u201D Figment Institutional Business Development Lead Josh Deems added. \u201CHowever, it is still challenging for institutions to buy crypto and stake directly. The ETPs will contribute to an increased accessibility to staking rewards for a wide audience.\u201D","The Ethereum and Solana staking ETPs aim to make it easier for institutions to access staking rewards from leading proof-of-stake assets. \u201CWith an ETP structure, the product benefits from full collateralization and over 50% staking utilization, returned to investors,\u201D the Figment team explained. \u201CThis allows conservative institutions to safely hold this asset class via an ETP without directly funding Ethereum or Solana validators.\u201D","Beyond providing exposure to the underlying crypto assets, the staking rewards generated via the ETPs include maximal extractable value. MEV refers to the maximum value that validators can extract in the block production process, in addition to the standard block reward and transaction fees, which can potentially be passed on to stakers. This is done by including, excluding or changing the order of transactions in a block.","Although similar staking ETPs are already available via asset managers such as CoinShares and 21Shares, Figment seeks to differentiate the offering by leveraging its prior expertise in developing staking infrastructure. Issuance.Swiss, a financial product issuance solution provided by Apex Fund Services, will handle the issuance of the ETPs.","The Figment ETPs both come with a management fee of 1.5%. This compares to a <a href=\"https:\/\/21shares.com\/product\/AETH\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">1.49%<\/a> fee for 21Shares\u2019 ether product and <a href=\"https:\/\/21shares.com\/product\/ASOL\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2.5%<\/a> for its solana ETP. CoinShares offers a reduced management fee of <a href=\"https:\/\/etp.coinshares.com\/physical\/ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">0%<\/a> for its products, though that is achieved by sharing the staking rewards.","\u201CThis product (issued by Issuance.Swiss) distinguishes itself from other staking ETP providers by prioritizing transparency and rewards performance,\u201D Gabel told The Block. \u201CThe ETHF product tracks a unique total rewards benchmark developed by MarketVector, utilizing Figment's staking rewards rate. This benchmark, recognized as the first true total rewards index, ensures transparency by avoiding censorship of reward types like MEV.\u201D","MarketVector and Figment <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241732\/marketvector-figment-introduce-first-staking-rewards-indexes\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">introduced<\/a> the index in July 2023, The Block previously reported.","\u201CFigment's active involvement in staking the majority of ETH and SOL using its infrastructure reinforces its industry leadership in risk-adjusted rewards performance,\u201D the Figment CEO added. \"As a result, the product anticipates offering a competitive rewards rate where 50% or more of the underlying asset will be staked and reinvested by the issuer back into the ETP.\u201D","However, Gabel did not comment on the specific level of yields anticipated. 21Shares offers a staking yield of 1.23% for ether and 4.9% for solana, according to its website. CoinShares offers 1.25% and 3% for ether and solana, respectively. While the ETPs reduce complexity within a regulatory-compliant wrapper, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stakingrewards.com\/asset\/ethereum-2-0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ether<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stakingrewards.com\/asset\/solana\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">solana<\/a> staking yields on offer are significantly lower than via crypto-native solutions.","With U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs launching successfully in January, attention has turned toward the prospect of spot ether ETFs coming next. Big-name firms, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263299\/blackrock-ethereum-etf-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlackRock<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263626\/fidelity-files-for-spot-ethereum-etf-says-approval-would-be-major-win-for-us-investors\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fidelity<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/277223\/franklin-templeton-takes-initial-step-for-spot-ethereum-etf-with-new-sec-filing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Franklin Templeton<\/a> have applied for a spot ether ETF over the last few months. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/280434\/spot-ether-etf-approvals-remain-uncertain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">opinions<\/a> on the prospect of approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission this year remain mixed.","\u201CWithout my SEC magic 8-ball it's hard to tell,\u201D Gabel told The Block regarding the prospect. \u201CSimilar to the process leading to bitcoin's approval, the SEC's feedback will likely provide clarity on whether staking will be included in these products which is what we're focusing on.\"","While spot ether ETFs might be next, following a similar approval process to that of CME futures and futures ETFs prior to the approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S., the prospects of spot ETFs for solana or other crypto assets remain remote for now."],"hashtag":["ETHEREUM","SOLANA","STAKING FIRMS"]}
