Many of the names the firm has backed overlap with the stocks that have become darlings among the Wall Street Bets crowd. Indeed, ARK has grown into a heavy-hitter on Wall Street.

The firm's Ark Innovation fund \u2014 which includes Tesla, Square, and Silvergate \u2014 has fallen sharply relative to the overall market, as The Journal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/ark-funds-fall-into-a-bear-market-11614962953\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> today.
