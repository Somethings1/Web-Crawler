BlackRock has a sterling record with ETF applications and ETFs tend to make it easier for retail investors to access underlying assets, potentially pumping millions or billions more into various markets.","Bitcoin holders and investors saw the influential firm\u2019s entrance into the historically crowded field of bitcoin spot ETF seekers as the chance for Charlie Brown to finally kick a football that's been teed up for years.","But news first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/237257\/sec-tells-nasdaq-cboe-that-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-are-inadequate-wsj\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> by the <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wall Street Journal<\/i>, that the SEC wants BlackRock and other recent applicants, including Nasdaq, Cboe and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235889\/fidelity-files-for-spot-bitcoin-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fidelity<\/a>, to revise and resubmit those applications didn\u2019t surprise industry experts.&nbsp;","A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment \u201Con potential filings.\u201D A Cboe spokesperson said it plans to update their filing and resubmit it to the SEC. Nasdaq, BlackRock and Fidelity declined to comment.&nbsp;","\u201CThe notion of a spot bitcoin ETF is very emotionally charged for some people, but it\u2019s not unusual for the SEC to send applications back and ask for clarifications,\u201D said Sean Tuffy, a financial regulatory expert.&nbsp;","Vivian Fang, a finance professor at Indiana University, sees the SEC\u2019s move asking applicants to make changes to their applications as a step forward in the approval of a spot bitcoin ETF.&nbsp;","BlackRock, for example, will change the language and then work to quickly resubmit, though the SEC could still ask for more clarity, Fang said.&nbsp;","\u201CI see this as very encouraging news as the SEC did not just go ahead and turn it down,\u201D Fang said. \u201CIt basically kicked it back and said, work on the application and there is a chance that this may get approved.\u201D","The SEC too likely wants \u201Creputable\u201D exchanges and asset managers involved with a spot bitcoin ETF, Fang added.&nbsp;","That may exclude existing crypto trading platforms, as none are registered as national securities exchanges, and most have listed assets that the SEC considers to be unregistered securities, likely complicating their ability to apply for that status.&nbsp;","Financial regulators including the SEC have also raised concerns that the way most if not all are structured, with normally separate functions like exchange and broker-dealer services, and sometimes proprietary trading, under the same roof. Allegations of crypto trading platform providers betting against their own customers are one example of what concerns regulators about the combination of those functions, and regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere highlighted it as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174527\/senior-u-s-regulators-propose-new-legislation-increased-rules-around-digital-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a major concern<\/a>, even prior to the collapse of trading giant FTX.&nbsp;","\"In other parts of our securities markets, the exchange, broker-dealer, and clearing functions are separate,\u201D SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a speech earlier this month. \u201CSeparation of these core functions helps mitigate the conflicts that can arise with the commingling of such services.\u201D","Splitting those services might also help assuage the SEC\u2019s longstanding hangup with bitcoin spot ETF applications: that the underlying market is opaque and prone to possible manipulation. The agency accuses Binance of market manipulation in its enforcement action against the crypto trading giant.","Despite regulatory scrutiny of crypto trading firms, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/237318\/cboe-updates-filings-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cboe submitted updated applications<\/a> late on Friday from Invesco, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Wise Origin to list Coinbase as the trading platform they would use for their surveillance-sharing agreements. ","Tuffy saw this regulatory skepticism towards existing crypto trading platforms as an issue for ETF applications moving forward. Even putting aside the SEC\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2023-102\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent enforcement action against Coinbase<\/a> over the agency\u2019s belief that Coinbase listed unregistered securities, among other violations the agency alleges, Coinbase isn\u2019t registered as a national securities exchange, so they likely could not be used for the spot market surveillance sharing agreement central to the new applications.&nbsp;","The lack of compliance in the digital asset industry may clear the path for traditional financial giants to step into the void and provide that service, potentially leaving established crypto trading firms behind.","\u201CIf you have BlackRock co-sharing the monitoring duties with Nasdaq, it is a golden team, you can\u2019t really beat that,\u201D Fang said.&nbsp;","Tuffy also saw it as an opportunity for traditional financial institutions to step into a bigger role in crypto markets, seeing it as a possibility that Nasdaq accelerates their offering in reaction to the SEC\u2019s guidance.&nbsp;","\u201CI think overall it\u2019s in-line with the SEC\u2019s skepticism over the bitcoin ETF. But if you\u2019re in the crypto world it\u2019s sort of hopeful, because they didn\u2019t outright reject it, they just asked for clarification,\u201D said Tuffy.&nbsp;","But he added a dose of cold water.","\u201CUltimately I think that as long as Gary Gensler is in charge I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get a bitcoin ETF through, so I am skeptical about the outcome,\u201D he said.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">UPDATE: With news of Cboe's revised ETF submissions on behalf of Invesco, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Wise Origin. <\/em>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
