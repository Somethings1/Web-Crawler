Ray took over as CEO of FTX after Bankman-Fried stepped down from that role. The new executive has described FTX\u2019s financial situation as the worst mess he\u2019s seen in his career, noting that the multibillion dollar business ran its accounting through the small business bookkeeping software Quickbooks, if it recorded financial transactions at all.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s really unprecedented in terms of the lack of documentation,\u201D said Ray, who called it a <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201Cpaperless bankruptcy.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ray laid into how Bankman-Fried and other executives handled FTX. He cautioned that the company\u2019s audited financial statements should not be trusted because the firm has lost so much cash.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We've lost $8 billion,\" Ray said. \"I don't trust a single piece of paper in this organization.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Unlike Enron, another corporate collapse that Ray helped clean up, the scheme executives ran at FTX was \u201Cnot sophisticated at all,\u201D Ray said. He called the Enron catastrophe \u201Chighly orchestrated\u201D in comparison to FTX.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"This is really old-fashioned embezzlement,\u201D Ray said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ray also noted that Bankman-Fried should have \u201Czero\u201D role in FTX as the bankruptcy process unfolds. In media interviews Bankman-Fried has raised doubts about the accuracy of Ray\u2019s court filings and complained that the company\u2019s new leadership is ignoring him.&nbsp;<\/span>","Bankman-Fried was hit with criminal and civil complaints from the U.S. Justice Department, Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Tuesday morning. Bankman-Fried is accused of giving Alameda special access to FTX customer funds and defrauding investors; he and other executives also gave themselves unpaid loans through Alameda.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> FTX\u2019s new leadership has been cooperating with U.S. regulators and plans to \u201Cturn over any information that would be relevant to them,\u201D Ray said.&nbsp;<\/span>","Ranking Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., called Bankman-Fried\u2019s arrest \u201Cwelcome news,\u201D but noted it does not reveal what went wrong at FTX, and said he still wanted to hear from the former FTX boss. <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI look forward to getting his lies here on the record, under oath,\" said the North Carolina Republican.&nbsp;<\/span>","He and top current Committee Chair Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said they still plan to move ahead on legislation around digital assets. The two have negotiated to draft a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins.&nbsp;","\u201CThis committee will not stop until we uncover the full truth behind the collapse of FTX,\u201D said Waters at Tuesday's hearing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Members of the committee dug into claims made by Ray and his lawyers that Bankman-Fried and his lawyers and fellow executives in the Bahamas are coordinating with the Bahamian government to undermine the bankruptcy process. After FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, some assets were transferred from the company, in a potential violation of U.S. bankruptcy law, Ray said.&nbsp;","\u201CThey just took it,\u201D said the FTX CEO.","Bankman-Fried and FTX co-founder Gary Wang minted approximately $300 million in new FTT tokens and moved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets, including those newly minted FTT tokens, into Bahamian custody after Bankman-Fried put nearly all his companies into the bankruptcy process, Ray said. The current FTX CEO suggested suggested his predecessor is working to undermine the U.S. bankruptcy process and that the bankruptcy process in the Bahamas is not transparent.","\u201CThe pushback that we\u2019ve gotten is sort of extraordinary in the context of bankruptcy. It raises questions. It seems irregular to me. There\u2019s lots of questions on our part,\u201D Ray said. \u201CWe\u2019ve repeatedly asked them for clarity about what they\u2019ve been doing and we\u2019ve been shut down on that.\u201D","Other members of the committee also still want Bankman-Fried to appear, if he's able to after federal criminal indictments against him unsealed on Tuesday.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think either way he needs to come talk to the committee, whether he\u2019s a prisoner or free on bail,\u201D said Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Absolutely,\" answered Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo. \u201CThere are some issues that I am concerned about that only he can answer.\u201D<\/span>","Others said that their patience is wearing thin with the crypto industry.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s been 14 years and the American public has heard lots of promises but it has seen lots of Ponzi schemes,\" said Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass. \"For crypto it\u2019s time to put up or shut up.\u201D<\/span>","McHenry, the incoming chair, promised another hearing on the subject after he takes over control of the committee next year.&nbsp;","\"You had somebody who was a 'crypto genius,' but behind closed doors was using Quickbooks,\" said the North Carolina Republican, noting what the committee heard in testimony from Ray. \"As chair of the committee it's my intention to continue the work of Chairwoman Waters when it comes to this matter.\"&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With additional reporting contributed by Kollen Post and Colin Wilhelm.&nbsp;<\/em>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
