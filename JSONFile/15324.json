It was launched by a quartet of pseudonymous founders (Smokey the Bera, Papa Bear, Homme Bera and Dev Bear) who are self-described crypto natives. Bera is bear intentionally misspelled, a sly hat tip to the deranged crypto rallying cry of Hodl.","Cosmos-based Berachain is, in essence, a rewind to the high-flying, is-this-a-Ponzi DeFi projects of 2021, before all the frauds, bankruptcies and Wells Notices sucked the degeneracy (and yields) out of crypto.","Berachain\u2019s origins trace back to a non-fungible token (NFT) collection, Bong Bears, which three of the four pseudonymous co-founders launched in August 2021. The project\u2019s OpenSea description reads: \u201C100 absolutely zooted NFT bears getting baked.\u201D But even the project\u2019s name (and Smokey\u2019s) is a misnomer. \u201CI don\u2019t think anyone on the core team even smokes,\u201D said Berachain co-founder Smokey in an interview with CoinDesk.","At the time, the team was inspired by the rebasing protocol OlympusDAO, which was rapidly gaining traction in the crypto community. In the fall of 2021, OlympusDAO\u2019s OHM token traded at a high of $1,300. (It has since fallen to about $10 per OHM.) Bong Bears followed in the footsteps of OlympusDAO, creating the first-ever collection of rebasing NFTs, which spawned several new collections \u2013 Bond Bears, Boo Bears, Baby Bears, Band Bears and Bit Bears.","Read More: Olympus DAO Might Be the Future of Money (or It Might Be a Ponzi)","Smokey says the pivot from Bong Bears NFTs to launching a fully-fledged layer-1 blockchain is not so far-fetched. \u201CBong Bears bootstrapped a community of DeFi enthusiasts,\u201D he said. \u201CWhat if we could take some of the liquidity and make it useful?\u201D","Berachain says its technology will allow staked assets to be used in DeFi protocols, creating more liquidity and capital efficiency on-chain. Currently, staked assets, such as staked ether (ETH), are locked while they are used to secure the underlying blockchain\u2019s network. Berachain says its \"proof of liquidity\" consensus will allow users to simultaneously stake assets on Berachain and use those assets to trade, borrow or lend on-chain.","According to a press release, the Bera ecosystem already has over $250 million in committed capital to deploy, and will launch a public incentivized testnet in the coming weeks.","\u201CIn a lot of cases, liquidity is mercenary,\u201D said Smokey. \u201CThe reason why they\u2019re mercenary is that you can\u2019t do much with stake assets, they just sit there.\u201D","\u201CBerachain \u2026 provides the first structure which aligns incentives between liquidity and security at the chain level, creating a massive opportunity to absorb the majority of liquidity and turn it into a sticky, capital efficient base for DeFi platforms to build on top of,\u201D said Polychain founder Olaf Carlson-Wee in a statement.","Berachain will also launch BERA, its native gas token, and BGT, its governance token. The ecosystem will also include a stablecoin, HONEY.","\u201CIf people want to think that we\u2019re a rug, I would tell them to do their own research,\u201D said Smokey. \u201CThere\u2019s a nontrivial history of pseudonymous projects doing good things.\u201D","UPDATE (April 20, 17:12 UTC):Â Adds name of additional investor.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"Baby Bears","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$250 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Tribe Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"August 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BGT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Papa Bear","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"April 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Olaf Carlson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$420.69 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Homme Bera","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bong Bears","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Band Bears","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BERA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"OHM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$42 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"fall of 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Robot Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Berachain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Smokey\u2019s)","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Smokey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1,300","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Polychain Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Shima Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wells Notices","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Berachain","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Olympus DAO","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Polychain Capital","Cosmos","Series A","DeFi"],"authors":["Tracy Wang"]}
