The proceedings have begun in Switzerland after months of negotiations.","The claim centers around Binance\u2019s automated liquidation system. It alleges that the exchange forced the investor to sell large amounts of a specific coin against his own interests. The investor also claims that Binance had a conflict of interest in the liquidation.","ICC arbitration rules are used around the world for cases that involve cross-border disputes. With arbitration proceedings, each side picks one arbitrator and a third independent one is put in place. So instead of a lawsuit where the case goes to a judge and jury, it\u2019s presented to three arbitrators.&nbsp;","Binance is also facing another potential lawsuit from its own users.
