Looking ahead, our priority is to continue delivering features and products that cater to our users' needs,\" said Pendle's CEO, who goes by TN.","The majority of trading on Pendle occurs on Ethereum, but the project is gaining some traction on Ethereum Layer 2 networks like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/214314\/yield-trading-protocol-pendle-finance-expands-to-arbitrum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arbitrum<\/a> and Mantle.","Pendle also lets users make trades with their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/277823\/crypto-projects-115b-points\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">points<\/a>.

However, such airdrops are guaranteed and the potential value that may be gleaned from these points is uncertain.","In response to this, Pendle's products let users hedge against their points or leverage them by up to 128 times. Points trading accounts for roughly 10% of the total-value locked on the platform.","\"Pendle's point farming strategies launched this year have been driving massive growth since they allow airdrop farmers to lever up in the form of buying yield tokens that accrue points for a fraction of the cost of the underlying principal often with added bonus multipliers) for prominent restaking protocols like EtherFi and Renzo,\" noted George Calle, Head of Research at The Block.&nbsp;","With Pendle's rapid growth, the price of the pendle token has grown steadily this year.
