In addition, Simpson said that the extensive media coverage of Bankman-Fried\u2019s case and his erstwhile net worth has \u201C[led] to multiple extortion attempts.\u201D","Another letter was submitted by Jamie Forrest, an adviser to Purpose Africa, a research entity focused on therapeutics.","Forrest was part of the group of researchers invited by Bankman-Fried to the Bahamas in early 2022. He wrote that Bankman-Fried\u2019s vision reflected a \u201Cman whose values were deeply rooted in global justice, fairness, and human dignity.\u201D","A clinical psychiatrist, Hassan Minhas, wrote that he believed Bankman-Fried met the criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder, which means he could \u201Cface an additional set of challenges\u201D in prison and, therefore, \u201Cwould benefit from ongoing access\u201D to therapy and monitoring.","Other supporting documents included snippets of Bankman-Fried\u2019s writings, emails and other communications from FTX and its employees and various documents from the exchange\u2019s bankruptcy.","\u201CThe letters of support confirm that the public needs no protection from Sam,\u201D the lawyers argued. \u201CSam, in short, presents the very opposite of the potential recidivist for whom prison is necessary.\u201D","Bankman-Fried\u2019s attorneys pushed back against various \u201Cenhancements\u201D \u2013 aspects that might add to a proposed prison term \u2013 recommended in the Presentence Investigation Report, saying they were inapplicable or unsupported.","Some of the memo argues against details discussed during or before Bankman-Fried\u2019s trial. Bankman-Fried drove \u201Cthe most basic car that was available,\u201D the memo said (former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison testified that this was a deliberate choice made for appearances\u2019 sake).","Campaign finance claims \u2013 which ultimately were not tried as a specific charge \u2013 should not be considered in sentencing, as the memo said Bankman-Fried did not have a chance to push back against the allegations.","The memo also said Bankman-Fried \u201Cobjects to the assertion that he \u2018instructed employees to set messages to auto-delete to evade law enforcement scrutiny,\u2019 and that he \u2018tampered\u2019 with witnesses.\u201D","The FTX founder\u2019s bond was revoked after Judge Kaplan ruled he had indeed attempted to tamper with witnesses \u2013 Ellison being one \u2013 a few months before his trial last year. Prosecutors also focused heavily on the auto-deleting message function during the trial.","According to Tuesday\u2019s memo, the Presentence Investigation Report alleges Bankman-Fried perjured himself during the trial.","\u201CNeither the government nor Probation identifies a single specific line of alleged perjurious testimony, which is enough to reject this enhancement,\u201D the filing said.","The memo goes on to detail Bankman-Fried\u2019s life, his philanthropy, his work ethic and his remorse.","It also drew contrasts between Bankman-Fried and Bernie Madoff, OneCoin-linked Sebastian Karl Greenwood and Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, arguing that the FTX founder\u2019s conviction most closely resembled Holmes\u2019 \u2013 except Holmes \u201Cput patients at risk.\u201D","According to the defense team, \u201Cthe best comparison\u201D would be the case against Michael Milken, who served two years of a 10-year sentence and \u201Cbecame a tremendous force for good in the world.\u201D","Read More: Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Sentence Might Be Lighter Than You\u2019d Expect","UPDATE (Feb. 28, 2024, 07:04 UTC): Adds additional detail.","UPDATE (Feb. 28, 2024, 08:30 UTC): Adds details from letter from Bankman-Fried\u2019s family and friends.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra and Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"Gabriel Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York Police Department","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ellison","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Torrey Young","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Caroline Ellison","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Simpson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Elizabeth Holmes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Milken","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"George Lerner","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Carmine Simpson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Joe Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Marc Mukasey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Purpose Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Holmes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX.US Head of Data Science Daniel Chapsky","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Natalie Tien","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Barbara Fried","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bernie Madoff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sebastian Karl Greenwood","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Autism Spectrum Disorder","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jamie Forrest","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bahamas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Stanford","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hassan Minhas","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Feb. 28, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"hundred cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"FTX Head of Communications","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Sam Bankman-Fried","SBF Trial","FTX Collapse","top news","Court Cases"],"authors":["Amitoj Singh","Nikhilesh De"]}
