It is set to give Robinhood's crypto product a more sophisticated edge.&nbsp;","\u201CScott, Victor and the Cove Markets team will bolster our crypto trading platform and help us strengthen our leadership in the crypto industry,\u201D said Christine Brown, chief operating officer of Robinhood Crypto. \u201CTheir wealth of experience in trading execution and crypto market infrastructure will help us to build more powerful trading capabilities, bringing the benefits of better competition in the crypto markets to our customers.\u201D","The acquisition is the first for Robinhood's crypto arm and follows its $140 million cash buyout of Say Technologies, its first major purchase since its IPO in July.&nbsp;","Earlier this week it also said it is preparing to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/127186\/robinhood-onboards-chainalysis-in-preparation-for-crypto-wallet-launch\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rollout a crypto wallet<\/a>, integrating analytics tools from leading crypto intelligence firm Chainalysis.","Currently, Robinhood offers users exposure to the price movements of various cryptocurrencies on its brokerage app, which also offers more traditional stock trading.

That is primarily a regulatory challenge, as the expectations for such a widely used platform to protect against money laundering are quite high.&nbsp;","Since Robinhood went public its stock price has taken a hammering.
