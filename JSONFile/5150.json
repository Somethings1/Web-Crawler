Moreover, Fidelity filed a registration of securities for its spot bitcoin ETF with the SEC on Wednesday,\" he added.","According to Dragosch, ETC Group's Cryptoasset Sentiment Index, CSI, still remains elevated despite Wednesday's sell-off in the bitcoin market. The metric has risen over the past few weeks from a negative reading to a current measure of just below 1.","\"Our in-house CSI has recently picked up again and currently signals a positive sentiment, as at the moment, 12 out of 15 indicators are above their short-term trend,\" Dragosch said. \"Compared to last week, we saw major reversals to the upside in BTC put-call volume ratio and BTC exchange inflows,\" he added.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ETC Group's crypto sentiment index remains high despite the recent sell-off in the bitcoin market.
