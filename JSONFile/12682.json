While the supply of gold and fiat currencies can fluctuate, Bitcoin's supply is cryptographically limited, offering a predictable financial foundation for such systems that cannot be manipulated, Hayes said.","According to Hayes, if the AI economy adopts Bitcoin, the collision of the need to escape inflation within the fiat system and the drive to participate in the next phase of human and computer evolution could spur investors to overvalue Bitcoin's growth.","\u201CIf Bitcoin is seen as likely to be \u2014 or even starts to be \u2014 used by AIs, then we could see two separate manias combine into one mega mania: the mania of wanting to escape inflation within the fiat financial system, and the mania of wanting to own a piece of the next phase of human and computer evolution'\" Hayes said. \"The overlap of these two manias would likely drive investors to grossly overpay for growth, causing the value of the Bitcoin network to rise to silly levels.\"","Hayes's predictive model forecasts that by 2025 or 2026, the AI economy could be worth between 5% and 50% of global GDP, generating a potential surge in Bitcoin's value as high as $760,000 per coin. As market assumptions shift from this \"can never happen to maybe could happen,\" that represents the period of greatest opportunity for those long on Bitcoin, Hayes said.","While the future of AI and Bitcoin remains uncertain, \u201CI plan to jump aboard the narrative hype wagon and profit,\u201D he added.","In May, Hayes predicted a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232399\/arthur-hayes-predicts-volatile-2023-followed-by-strong-bitcoin-rally\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">volatile year<\/a> for Bitcoin in 2023, followed by a strong rally from 2024.","Â© 2023 The Block.
