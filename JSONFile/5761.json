Indeed, not long after it gatecrashed the crypto media landscape the publication put out a jaw-dropping investigation into the state of pay-for-play in crypto.&nbsp;","As reported by staff reporter Corin Faife, Breaker found through its own investigative research that a majority of so-called crypto publications \u2014 including NewsBTC and AMB Crypto \u2014 took money to write stories.&nbsp;","\"The prices quoted for this ranged from a low of $240 to a high of $4500, which reflects the size and reach of the outlets we investigated,\" <a href=\"https:\/\/breakermag.com\/we-asked-crypto-news-outlets-if-theyd-take-money-to-cover-a-project-more-than-half-said-yes\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Faife reported<\/a>.","Sources said the reasoning behind the shut down is lack of a viable business plan and high-burn rate from the perspective of its owner Breaker.","Among its leadership ranks were Editor-in-Chief Ben Schiller, who previously ran a European management magazine. Schiller was also a staff writer for Fast Company from 2011 to April 2018.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
