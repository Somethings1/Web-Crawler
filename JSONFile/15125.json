(It\u2019s the second-largest round to be led by the VC firm, with Figure\u2019s $103 million Series C topping the list.)","","","At the moment, BlockFi has $1.5 billion in crypto assets on its lending platform and is producing a little less than $10 million a month in revenue, CEO Zac Prince said in an interview. He said BlockFi is still trying to add personnel and keep equity capital stable in order to quickly expand geographically.","","","Prince also expects to have the first bitcoin rewards cards in the market by year\u2019s end and a more public rollout early next year.","","","\u201CYou have to work with quite a few partners to bring a credit card to market,\u201D Prince said. \u201CSome of them haven\u2019t really handled the transition from being fully in-office to being fully remote as smoothly as companies like BlockFi have.\u201D ","","","Other participants in the Series C include Peter Thiel\u2019s Valar Ventures \u2013 the lead investor in BlockFi\u2019s A and B rounds \u2013 CMT Digital, Castle Island Ventures, Winklevoss Capital, SCB 10X, Avon Ventures, Purple Arch Ventures, Kenetic Capital, HashKey, Michael Antonov, National Basketball Association player Matthew Dellavedova and two unnamed university endowments.","","","Read more: Bitcoin Lender BlockFi Raises $30M in Series B Led by Peter Thiel\u2019s Valar Ventures","","","Dellavedova, who is a guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers, first learned about crypto in 2017 and was introduced to BlockFi by Morgan Creek\u2019s Pompliano later on, he said in an interview. ","","","Dellavedova has been making angel investments for the past three to four years, but BlockFi is the basketball player\u2019s first crypto play, aside from holding \u201Ca little\u201D bitcoin and ether, he said.","","","\u201CI would say I\u2019m still a rookie in this space,\u201D he said. \u201CI think having an interest rate that you can have on your crypto is appealing.\u201D","","","Repeat investor Sterling Witzke, a partner at Winklevoss Capital, said BlockFi's ability to \"resonate with both retail and institutional customers\" has been a key selling point. \"We look forward to supporting the BlockFi team as they launch their next iteration of products and continue to drive mainstream adoption, firmly cementing crypto at the core of the future of finance,\" she said in a statement.","","","Prince said BlockFi was able to continue its lending operation even after the March bitcoin crash while other lending firms took a short break.","","","Similar to Genesis and Celsius, BlockFi says March ended up being a good month for crypto lending because of the sector\u2019s primary borrowers \u2013 proprietary traders and market makers. ","","","\u201CThe event in March, we didn\u2019t like it because there were clients of ours who have borrowed dollars secured by their cryptocurrency holdings, where we had to issue margin calls,\u201D Prince said. \u201CThe way that we handled that I believe was more fair and flexible than the way those things are handled on platforms where everything is very black and white.\u201D","","","Read more: $100M+ in Margin Calls: Crypto Lenders Demand Collateral as Market Buckles","","","While interest rates on fiat-backed crypto loans have trended downward after March, demand for bitcoin-backed dollar loans remains high, he added.","","","\u201CIf you look at the futures curve today, it\u2019s implying north of 15% cost of borrowing cash, which makes sense given the bullish position in the market,\u201D Prince said. ","","","BlockFi\u2019s largest expense is people, Prince said, as the team has grown from just under 100 at the beginning of the year to 175 now, with engineering and security making up half of the staff.","","","Another major growth area is BlockFi\u2019s risk-management team, including hires related to security infrastructure, compliance and financial risk, Prince said. The lender also has new sales and client-relationship teams in London and Singapore and one employee in Hong Kong. ","","","Part of the Series C will go toward building a larger balance sheet so BlockFi can remain a less risky institution in the eyes of its counterparties. As a general rule, the firm is aiming to have a loan leverage ratio that is more conservative than what you would find at a traditional bank, which typically holds a minimum 5% leverage ratio. ","","","Read more: Crypto Lender BlockFi Rolls Out Zero-Fee Trading for Bitcoin, Ether, GUSD","","","Nothing has changed about BlockFi\u2019s collateral levels or its rehypothecation of loan collateral, Prince added. The CEO claims the firm\u2019s loan and security agreement is more transparent than what customers would find at a securities lender in the traditional markets, where rehypothecation of loan collateral is also common. ","","","\u201CIt\u2019s a scary word,\u201D Prince said about rehypothecation. \u201CIt\u2019s the folks who are cut from a similar cloth as the \u2018not your keys, not your crypto\u2019 crowd.\u201D","","","Prince would not say whether BlockFi invests customer assets into perpetual swaps, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares or other investment vehicles. ","","","\u201CWe think about those and would consider them if it\u2019s appropriate within the context of our risk-management function,\u201D Prince said without going into detail.","","","Prince also admitted that BlockFi does uncollateralized lending to counterparties with \u201Ccertain financial requirements\u201D but would not say what percentage of the lender\u2019s loan book was comprised of unsecured loans.",""],"entity":[{"type":"Morgan Creek\u2019s Pompliano","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Peter Thiel","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto Lenders Demand Collateral","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Castle Island Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"National Basketball Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Peter Thiel\u2019s Valar Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michael Antonov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kenetic Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Purple Arch Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"15%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"London","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Winklevoss Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Valar Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anthony Pompliano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"fiat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Morgan Creek Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Prince","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CMT Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cleveland Cavaliers","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Zac Prince","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$100M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Avon Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$103 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Matthew Dellavedova","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SCB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sterling Witzke","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$30M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$50 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Venture Capital","BlockFi","NBA","Morgan Creek Digital","Crypto Lending","Zac Prince"],"authors":["Nate DiCamillo"]}
