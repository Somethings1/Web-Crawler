Foundry and Grayscale are both subsidiaries of the Digital Currency Group (DCG).","\u201CAs part of Foundry\u2019s mission to empower a decentralized infrastructure, we\u2019re excited to partner with Grayscale to broaden the ability to invest in bitcoin mining during this opportune time,\" said Foundry CEO Michael Colyer in a statement from Grayscale.","Bitcoin miners have seen their margins decline in the past few months, as the cryptocurrency has fallen in value.","\"In the coming months, we anticipate some miners will be forced to liquidate their mining equipment,\" said Sharif-Askary. \"GDIO is positioned to provide liquidity to these miners, purchasing mining equipment at distressed prices, and mining profitably as the price of Bitcoin recovers.\"","There's been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169988\/bitcoin-mining-execs-talk-industry-consolidation-cleansparks-asset-deal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">talk of consolidation<\/a> in the bitcoin mining industry, and companies like CleanSpark already have been leveraging market conditions to scoop up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/168193\/bitcoin-miner-cleanspark-bought-10000-asics-at-a-significantly-discounted-price\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">thousands of mining machines<\/a> at discounted prices.","Â© 2023 The Block.
