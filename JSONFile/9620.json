Solana is \u201Ccontinuing to assert itself as the altcoin of choice,\u201D Head of Research James Butterfill wrote, particularly considering the recent launch of ether futures ETF products. Solana funds have recorded inflows in 28 weeks this year, with just four weeks of outflows in 2023.","Bitcoin dominated the overall inflows, adding $43 million. However, some investors capitalizing on recent price strength began adding to short-bitcoin product positions \u2014 resulting in inflows of $1.2 million during the same period.","The regional divide continued, with Europe outpacing the United States again last week \u2014 accounting for 90% of the inflows. The U.S. and Canada made up just $9 million of the inflows combined, suggesting further divergence in sentiment, according to Butterfill.","Trading volumes for exchange-traded products also witnessed a 37% spike, reaching $1.13 billion for the week \u2014 and bitcoin volume on trusted exchanges saw a 16% rise.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Weekly crypto asset flows.

Especially when compared to the $1 billion witnessed by bitcoin futures ETFs in their first week in 2021, albeit in a very different market environment.","\u201CIt is likely due to poor investor appetite for digital assets at present, and unfair to compare to the bitcoin futures ETF launches in October 2021, as appetite was much higher for the asset class overall,\u201D Butterfill said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
