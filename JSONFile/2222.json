Siu had <a href=\"https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Editor-s-Picks\/Interview\/Blockchain-group-Animoca-to-form-metaverse-fund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told Nikkei<\/a> as recently as November that Animoca would target $2 billion for the fund, which will make mid- to late-stage bets in the sector.","The news comes with the crypto sector still reeling from the spectacular collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX in November. Around a dozen of Animoca\u2019s portfolio startups were affected, Siu told Bloomberg.","\u201CQ1 is the goal and then let\u2019s see what happens,\u201D Siu told Bloomberg of Animoca Capital\u2019s plans, adding that market conditions may mean the fund raises less than its target. \u201CIt is fair to say it\u2019s a challenging market. But we have quite a bit of interest.\u201D","Animoca Brands is one of the most prolific investors in web3, having made more than 380 investments as of Dec. 6, according to a company spokesperson. Accounting for so great a haul of tokens, however, has proven tricky. The company was recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/198445\/animoca-brands-allowed-deadline-extension-for-filing-results\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">granted an extension<\/a> for filing its audited financial report for 2020, which had originally been due to Australian regulators by the end of last year.","Animoca did not immediately respond to The Block's request for comment.","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
