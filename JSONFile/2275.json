While he remains bullish on crypto prices over the long term, he puts forward the view that they\u2019re standing on the precipice of a \u201Ccalamitous outcome.\u201D","The premise is based on the idea that if the Nasdaq 100 drops, it will drag down crypto with it. He puts forward a range of charts showing the correlation between traditional markets and crypto to back up this suggestion.","What\u2019s more complicated is why he argues the Nasdaq 100 will go down. Part of the reason is the impact caused by the Russian invasion. Hayes writes, \u201CGlobal growth will decline on higher commodity prices driven by the continuation and possible escalation of the Russia \/ Ukraine war.\u201D He adds that this will hurt the price of stocks.","The second argument is that falling interest rates tend to support the Nasdaq 100, while the world is currently seeing higher interest rates in response to inflation.","The third element is based on looking at the chart for the Nasdaq 100. Hayes says that the tech index failed to bounce significantly on a key technical level, suggesting that it may go lower.","Put together, he\u2019s bearish in the short term. Hayes estimates that bitcoin could go as low as $30,000 before the end of June, with ether falling to $2,500.&nbsp;","Looking beyond bitcoin, Hayes says he\u2019s been accumulating some other cryptocurrencies as they\u2019re at much lower prices. But he remains concerned that they will drop lower during this year. \u201CEven though some of these coins are already down 75% from their all-time high, I don\u2019t believe even they can escape the coming crypto carnage,\u201D he says. As a result, he\u2019s hedging his bets by buying put options that would perform well if the market crashes this quarter.","Hayes accepts that this analysis may not play out fully. \u201CI will be wrong if the correlation between Bitcoin \/ Ether and [Nasdaq 100] starts dropping before a crash in risk asset markets,\u201D he says. But he acknowledges that he\u2019s fine with that since he maintains a long position on crypto over the longer term.","<i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For more breaking stories like this, make sure to follow The Block on&nbsp;<\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a class=\"c-link\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-remove-tab-index=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a><\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/i>"],"hashtag":["BITCOIN","CRYPTO"]}
