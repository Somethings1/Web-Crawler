He said:","Rather than focusing on money transmission or payments, as at present, the firm will likely begin to develop services \u201Clike hardware, analytics and payroll and lending,\u201D Dorsey said.","Square integrated bitcoin in 2018, when its Cash App began selling the cryptocurrency to users. This service generated over $190 million in revenue over the first two quarters of this year, yielding shy of $3 million in gross profit.","In a separate interview with two other Australian publications, The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, Dorsey took a thinly veiled swipe at social media giant Facebook\u2019s leap into cryptocurrency. He said neither Square nor his other company, Facebook rival Twitter, would create a native token, adding:","Dorsey reiterated his view that bitcoin has a \u201Chigh probability\u201D of becoming the internet\u2019s \u201Cnative currency,\u201D or the basis for all payments made online.","\u201CIt's been the most resilient, it's around for 10 years, it has a great brand and it's been tested a bunch,\u201D he said.","Still, Dorsey said Square\u2019s exposure to various payment methods could help the company \u201Cweather storms,\u201D referring to economic downturns.","These comments come on the heels of Square Crypto\u2019s hire of renowned bitcoin developer Matt Corallo. The bitcoin-focused division, headed by former Google director Steve Lee, aims to bolster the adoption of crypto payments.","\"We're hiring five open source engineers to work entirely on making the crypto ecosystem better. I think the internet will have a native currency and anything we can do to make that happen we'll do,\u201D Dorsey said.","Jack Dorsey at Consensus 2018, image via CoinDesk archives"],"entity":[{"type":"$190 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Matt Corallo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Square Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Steve Lee","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"The Australian Financial Review","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Aug. 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"The Sydney Morning Herald","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Square","News","Jack Dorsey","Square Crypto"],"authors":["Daniel Kuhn"]}
