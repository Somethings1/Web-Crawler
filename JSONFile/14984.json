Binance CEO Changpeng \u201CCZ\u201D Zhao told CoinDesk the deal closed March 31, although a verbal agreement had been reached \u201Ca few months ago.\u201D ","","","With its extensive (although often questionable) data on prices, volumes and other metrics for 5,290 cryptocurrencies, CMC has served as a dragnet for retail investors since its launch in 2013. ","","","\u201CIt\u2019s a really good website and I think we can help grow it further,\u201D Zhao said in an interview with CoinDesk Thursday, adding he had no immediate plans for CMC. Zhao said the domain will remain independent from Binance under a holding company, perhaps staving off concerns over potential conflicts of interest.","","","Industry veterans told CoinDesk they see a future where CMC could serve as a marketing channel for Binance, steering prospective customers toward the exchange. Zhao, on the other hand, characterized it as a simple, albeit large, purchase of a cash-flow positive asset. ","","","\u201CIt\u2019s by far the largest we have done so far,\u201D he said of the deal.","","","The acquisition shows that while many firms looked to institutional players as crypto's messiah in 2019 and even today, Zhao is pinning his hopes on a mass audience of individual investors after buying the most heavily trafficked website in the space.","","","Amazon\u2019s Alexa ranks CMC as the 570th most visited website globally in the last 90 days. That\u2019s compared to Binance and rival exchange Coinbase at 1,688 and 1,562, respectively. The next closest data provider is CoinGecko at 7,350.","","","Zhao\u2019s purchase also caps CMC\u2019s journey, from a scrappy outfit run out of founder Brandon Chez\u2019s apartment to a property coveted by an industry leader. In fact, Zhao said he had pursued Chez for years. With the sale, Chez is stepping down.","","","\u201CCMC was not for sale,\u201D CMC interim CEO Carylyne Chan said in an interview. \u201COpportunity came along.\u201D (Chan now joins Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley as one of two female chief executives running firms connected to the exchange in a historically male-dominated industry.)","","","Earlier this week, The Block reported the acquisition was in the works, and put the price tag at $400 million in cash and stock options, citing unnamed sources. Founders and investors interviewed by CoinDesk gave differing opinions on the plausibility of the figure; some said it sounded too high, others thought it was too low. While both Chan and Zhao declined to give actual figures for the acquisition, citing non-disclosure agreements, Zhao confirmed it was Binance\u2019s biggest acquisition to date.","","","\u201CCoinMarketCap has more users than any other product in the crypto space,\u201D Zhao said. \u201CEven though their money generation mechanism is not as strong as Binance, they do have the users \u2013 it\u2019s a very valuable platform.\u201D","","","Read more: Crypto\u2019s King Midas: Backstage With CZ, the CEO Who Can\u2019t Be Stopped","","","Earnest conversations between CoinMarketCap and Binance date back to the data provider\u2019s conference for investors in November 2019, said Chan.","","","Zhao hinted at the coming acquisition, along with one other unannounced purchase, in a New Year\u2019s Day blog post. Binance bought nine separate entities last year alone and plans to onboard 180 fiat currencies by the end of 2020 in an aggressive push to sign up retail customers. The company\u2019s tagline is \u201Cexchanging the world.\u201D","","","It\u2019s easy to see, then, why CoinMarketCap\u2019s status as the first landing page for retail investors would be attractive to Zhao despite his past criticisms of CMC for its data quality.","","","If reports about the price are true, the deal stands as one of the top M&A deals in crypto history. Circle, now a shell of its former self, purchased Poloniex for $400 million in 2018 but has since spun off the exchange and pivoted to focusing on stablecoins.","","","For CMC, the acquisition follows a ride through choppy waters. The firm quickly became both the dominant data source and go-to platform for asset pricing in the nascent industry. ","","","It also became a lightning rod for controversy after a 2019 report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by digital asset manager Bitwise found artificial trade volume from 95 percent of the crypto exchanges that provide data to CMC.","","","Startups such as Nomics, Messari and CoinGecko seized the Bitwise report to chip into CMC\u2019s lead, particularly among institutional investors, which require robust data and can\u2019t expose their clients to manipulation.","","","Read more: For $15K, He\u2019ll Fake Your Exchange Volume \u2013 You\u2019ll Get on CoinMarketCap","","","Rival exchanges reacted with mixed emotions at news of the deal, which could firmly outdistance Binance from the pack.","","","Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at OKEx, said it was good to see such large M&A deals in the context of a \u201Cbearish market in crypto.\u201D","","","Big players investing back into key infrastructure is healthy for crypto, Lai said, even if warranting skepticism.","","","\u201CPeople might have doubts about whether or not CMC could maintain its independence afterward. It\u2019s fair. But I think we should give the team a chance,\u201D he said. ","","","Andy Cheung, former chief operating officer at OKEx and founder of crypto derivative platform ACDX, was more critical in his assessment. ","","","The acquisition \u201Cis not very good for the industry\u201D given the conflict of interest between the parties\u2019 missions, he said, pointing to Binance\u2019s exchange token, BNB, as an example.","","","\u201CI can understand the business or potential profit,\u201D Cheung said. \u201CBut honestly, how are you going to convince people that the rankings and volume are true when you\u2019re operating an exchange and also probably the biggest holder of BNB?\u201D","","","Cheung even saw it as a blow to Zhao\u2019s cult of personality.","","","\u201CCZ has been telling everyone, \u2018We are not here for the money and building something bigger and meaningful for humanity.\u2019 Now I\u2019m disappointed, I hope I am wrong and he has a better reason behind\u201D the purchase, he said.","","","One Silicon Valley crypto investor speaking on the condition of anonymity doubted the reported $400 million buyout figure and said the overall deal \u201Cfeels like a favor\u201D to CMC founder Chez. ","","","\u201CThe founder is very stealth and I think has the majority of the cap table. And he's struggled to monetize for years,\u201D the investor said.","","","That\u2019s not to say Binance doesn\u2019t have loose change to throw around. Two sources said Binance is \u201Cflush\u201D with cash, with one pointing toward futures trading customers departing BitMEX following a critical error on March 12 as a recent boon.","","","CMC sits in an awkward spot after its acquisition. ","","","Although it is typically the first port of call for small retail buyers, institutional investors spurned the website, particularly after Bitwise\u2019s SEC report. At the same time, CMC has some of the best data in the industry because of its sheer volume: exchanges have always used CMC, so why change now?","","","Nomics founder and CEO Clay Collins told CoinDesk that a certain degree of trust is necessitated between an exchange and a data provider; trust that \u201Cis likely to be eroded here\u201D with CMC under the same roof as Binance.","","","If rival exchanges feel threatened by the possibility of Binance harvesting data from CMC, those firms will be \u201Cmuch less willing to provide low-latency and high-granularity data,\u201D Collins said.","","","\u201CThat data is now being given to a competitor with surveillance abilities. It\u2019s unlikely that other exchanges will want to see Binance aggregating and monetizing their own data,\u201D he said. ","","","Collins\u2019 concerns were seconded by Alexei Andryunin, head of Gotbit, a Russian token and exchange promotion service. That\u2019s a polite way to describe the business, which Andryunin has candidly admitted inflated volumes on CMC for small-cap coins via wash-trading bots.","","","In Andryunin\u2019s view, the purchase will provide Binance with \u201Cdata on all their competitors, plus some of the best expertise for traffic generation in the crypto industry.\u201D","","","However, leveraging or altering data would be equivalent to sending the investment to a burner address, Andryunin said. \u201CBinance is incentivized to keep this service transparent so that they don\u2019t lose their investment. I think they\u2019ll try to preserve CMC\u2019s reputation.\u201D ","","","He also said that CMC\u2019s summer 2019 capitalization was estimated at $650 million, suggesting the reported $400 million offering was a bargain.","","","Read more: We Still Don\u2019t Know Bitcoin\u2019s Real Volume","","","Binance aside, CMC\u2019s Chan said data concerns continue to be a key part of the firm\u2019s focus. ","","","The firm is launching both \u201Cqualitative data as well as quantitative data\u201D features in 2020, Chan said. \u201CStronger agreements\u201D could be put in place to \u201Cprotect [exchanges\u2019] interest as well,\u201D she acknowledged.","","","\u201CIn a sense, it\u2019s in our interest to continue to be neutral and to be transparent and independent,\u201D Chan said. ","","","Zhao acknowledged CMC\u2019s shortcomings, saying the firm \u201Cneeds to resolve\u201D numerous issues and \u201Cmake the product better over time.\u201D That responsibility falls to Chan and her team, though, he said.","","","\u201CI\u2019m not dictating it,\u201D Zhao said.","","","Meanwhile, the purchase frees up elbow room for other data aggregators, particularly on the institutional side of the market, said Messari co-founder and CEO Ryan Selkis. In an email to CoinDesk, and in his own newsletter and Twitter feed, Selkis described the buyout as a win for everyone, including data companies that won\u2019t receive a check.","","","\u201CIt\u2019s great news for other crypto data companies, and information businesses. Audience and influence matters. Quality data matters,\u201D he said in a company newsletter.","","","Yan Liberman, principal at research and consulting firm Delphi Digital, said these larger acquisitions are good for the sector and show overall maturation. He added that it\u2019s best to wait and see on Binance\u2019s relationship with CMC rather than cast stones early.","","","\u201CThe initial reaction might be to look at other data providers\/platforms as comparables, but because of all the nuances\/differences among them, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very useful to do that until we get a better understanding of what the plans are for CMC,\u201D Liberman said.","","","Not much will change for CMC once the acquisition takes place, Chan said. All of the firm\u2019s roughly 40 employees \u2013 minus Chez, who will stay on as an advisor \u2013 will join the 930-person Binance staff, Zhao said.","","","Chan said the firm will continue to alter its infamous advertisement structure, but will still host paid-marketing for other exchanges.","","","Since the firm will operate separately from Binance, Zhao will have to dish out more money if Binance wants to advertise on CMC, she said.","","","For his part, Chez \u2013 the sole shareholder of CMC \u2013 walks away from crypto with a big chunk of change in his pocket \u2013 fiat or otherwise. Chan said Chez\u2019s focus remains on his family during the coronavirus crisis and subsequent quarantine he and his family currently live under. ","","","\u201CWe would love to keep him, but he wants to take a break and, given the size of the deal, it makes total sense,\u201D Zhao said.","","","Zack Seward, David Pan and Anna Baydakova contributed reporting.",""],"entity":[{"type":"November 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"\u201D Cheung","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"The Block","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"David Pan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Carylyne Chan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CMC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zack Seward","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Andy Cheung","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Messari","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$400 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Andryunin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Delphi Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ryan Selkis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"95 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Anna Baydakova","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last 90 days","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 31","content":"DATE"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Clay Collins","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$650 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CoinMarketCap","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Collins","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitwise","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lennix Lai","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Yan Liberman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Alexa","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$15K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Catherine Coley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Selkis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nomics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lai","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Chez","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alexei Andryunin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitwise\u2019s SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"summer 2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Earnest","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BNB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Liberman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Brandon Chez","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Acquisitions","CoinMarketCap","Binance","M&amp;A"],"authors":["William Foxley"]}
