FY 2021 begins on October 1, 2020.","Unsurprisingly, among those agencies in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Meanwhile, investigators across most sanctions programs are reporting increasing exposure to the use of virtual currencies by the targets of their investigations. Additional virtual currency investigators will allow investigations involving cryptocurrency across all of OFAC\u2019s sanctions programs to be able to exploit this investigative arena.\"<\/span>","The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), <a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/system\/files\/266\/12.-FinCEN-FY-2021-CJ.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to budget documents<\/a>, is seeking $819,000 and three full-time employees to support \"<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Building Out FinCEN\u2019s Virtual Currency and Cyber Threat Mitigation Program.\"<\/span>","As FinCEN explained:","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"These funds will allow for international capacity building to ensure that accessibility of critical information exists for investigations that include an international component. The utilization of software tools will allow FinCEN to double the number of virtual currencies analyses, corroborate findings, and increase big data analytics capability, allowing for automated analytics and visualization of financial and cyber data. The program enhancement strengthens direct support for law enforcement cases to 130 cases per year, the development of 37 strategic intelligence products, and the provision of 50 training sessions per year.\"<\/span>","U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/55734\/trump-administration-to-release-new-fincen-requirements-for-cryptos-mnuchin-tells-congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday<\/a> that FinCEN is gearing up to release new requirements related to cryptocurrencies, although what shape such a move will take remains to be seen.&nbsp;","\u201CWe want to make sure that technology moves forward, but on the other hand, we want to make sure that cryptocurrencies aren't used for the equivalent of old Swiss secret number bank accounts,\u201D Mnuchin remarked.","Independent agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are also seeking more money to support their crypto-related efforts in FY 2021.","According to its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cftc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-02\/Final_Budget_2021PB_w_Cover.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">budget documentation<\/a>, the Division of Risk and Clearing as well as the &nbsp;Division of Enforcement are both seeking increases.","The Division of Enforcement noted in its request:","\"This budget request supports the Commission\u2019s efforts to examine the different approaches to protecting digital assets used by DCOs. In addition, there is a need to supply technical training to our systems risk analysts so they are better equipped with the knowledge needed to identify these novel and unique risks.\"","On a broader level, the CFTC noted that its work on digital assets \u2013 and the need to expand their work \u2013 is supported among the agency's leaders as well.","\"Chairman [Heath] Tarbet has stressed the importance for U.S. leadership of blockchain and digital assets, and expressed his view that 'CFTC\u2019s role is to ensure that there\u2019s integrity in the markets and we want these markets to develop in way that has integrity,'\" the agency wrote, adding:","\"The Commission\u2019s Digital Assets Task Force will fulfill that mandate, which, given the explosive growth of this technology, will require additional resources in FY 2021 to aggressively prosecute these cases.\"","In other cases, the funding increase requests for FY 2021 mention virtual currency as an operational factor.","For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) office <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/doj\/page\/file\/1246311\/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">is asking for<\/a> an additional $1.5 million to hire six analysts. As noted in its request: \"<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Illicit financial networks are inherent to illegal activity and are often at the center of TOC investigations; however, due to the international movement of illicit funds and technological developments (e.g., virtual currency), thorough financial analysis is limited.\"<\/span>","The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/doj\/page\/file\/1246331\/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">is seeking<\/a> $3.25 million to provide analytics and data support for its transaction-centric investigations.
