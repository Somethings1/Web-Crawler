The most exciting of these is the integration of the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), which will connect Kava to the Cosmos ecosystem and enable holders of ATOM, OSMO, LUNA, AKT, and many other IBC-enabled assets to earn high yields with them on the Kava Platform.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As Kava prepares to connect to the IBC, the citizens of the network have offered a handsome bounty to anyone willing to help them secure it. Intrepid explorers from across the Cosmos are gathering to do battle in the hopes of claiming the top prize: $10K in ATOM and $10K in KAVA.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During the event, competitors will use a mixture of IBC assets on the testnet to earn and claim rewards on the Kava Platform.

IBC will make moving assets from IBC-enabled chains onto Kava effortless. ATOM holders, for instance, will be able to immediately begin leveraging up their positions using Kava Mint and earning with Kava Lend and Swap. KAVA, HARD, SWP, and USDX holders will also be able to use them on other chains in the Cosmos ecosystem, giving them new utility.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kava is taking a huge step toward an interoperable future with the launch of Kava 9 and IBC.
