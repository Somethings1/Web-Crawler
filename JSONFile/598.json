Peer-to-peer marketplaces allow users to buy and sell digital assets directly with others, in-person or online. This contrasts with traditional crypto exchanges, which facilitate trading between buyers and sellers.","The Noones app comprises a marketplace where users across 190 countries can trade bitcoin and stablecoins using over 400 payment methods \u2014 including gift cards, mobile money, bank transfers and other cryptocurrencies \u2014 and a messenger through which the majority of peer-to-peer trades take place.","Additionally, Noones plans to introduce wallet functionality for bill payments in collaboration with top African vendors.","Youssef said he is passionate about Bitcoin\u2019s potential to help eradicate poverty and give the Global South a bigger voice in the world\u2019s financial ecosystem. \u201CThe internet, mobile phones and a wave of disruptive startups failed to truly disrupt money,\u201D Youssef said. \u201CAt Noones, we believe that Bitcoin is the way. New financial tools are creating unprecedented, borderless opportunities and these tools empower and will continue to empower the people in ways never seen before.\u201D","Founded in 2015, Paxful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/paxful-hits-5-billion-volume-301277325.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hit<\/a> $5 billion in total volume traded on the platform in 2021, with Nigeria, China, India, Kenya and the U.S. its top five countries by volume.
