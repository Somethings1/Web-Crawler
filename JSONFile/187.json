The firm confirmed that a cohort of its wallets were compromised in the breach, though it did not speculate on how the exploit originated.&nbsp;","\"We have some hypotheses as to the nature of the breach, but nothing is yet firm,\" Slope Finance said in a Medium post.","It recommended users create a new seed phrase wallet and transfer all assets to the new wallet. Those using a hardware wallet have not been compromised. The firm is continuing to work with \"developers, security experts, and protocols from throughout the ecosystem to work to identify and rectify\" the situation.&nbsp;","\"We are still actively diagnosing, and are committed to publishing a full postmortem, earning back your trust, and making this as right as we can,\" Slope said.","Reports from users of Phantom and Slope surfaced Tuesday night, claiming wallets had been drained of SOL and SPL in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/161115\/more-than-5000-wallets-drained-in-apparent-exploit-on-solana-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">apparent exploit<\/a> on the Solana network. As of 5 a.m. UTC, almost 8,000 wallets had been affected, though hardware wallets were not impacted.","The exploit was likely a \"supply chain attack\" on wallets using Apple's iOS operating system, Solana Labs co-founder and CEO Anatoly Yakovenko said on Twitter earlier on Wednesday."],"hashtag":["SOLANA"]}
