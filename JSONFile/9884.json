This goes against the government's mandate to promote and encourage competition and enabling innovation to thrive,\u201D wrote Taylor.","The letter outlines the difficulties faced by crypto firms that have attempted to register in the past year. Some have waited more than eight months for a response from the regulator; one firm applied in the summer of last year and still doesn\u2019t have a case officer; while others have been reassigned new case officers almost a year on from applying, creating \u201Ca complete lack of continuity\u201D, Taylor wrote.","CryptoUK\u2019s plea to the chancellor also suggests that the FCA disbanded its crypto-asset team last year. The team had, according to the letter, formed part of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fca.org.uk\/firms\/cryptoassets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the Cryptoasset Taskforce<\/a> \u2013 a unit set up in March 2018 to spearhead the combined crypto policy work of HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the FCA.","\u201CIt is understood that FCA staff with years of experience gained working within the UK\u2019s Cryptoasset Taskforce have been reassigned to various other departments, and that the Cryptoasset Authorisation Team is generally understaffed,\u201D wrote Taylor. He added that \u201Cthe few staff assigned\u201D to handling the crypto register lack the experience of their predecessors.","The so-called crypto-assets register was set up when the FCA took over as the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing watchdog for UK crypto companies in early 2020. Firms were initially told they had until January 10, 2021 to sign up to the FCA's register or cease trading.","But with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/86276\/uk-fca-crypto-registry-backlog-aml\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">more than 150 outstanding applications<\/a> late last year, and just four firms registered, the FCA announced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/88013\/uk-regulator-fca-crypto-temporary-registration-regime-new-deadline-july-9\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a \u201Ctemporary registration regime\u201D<\/a> in mid-December \u2013 giving applicants until July 9 to continue operating. That gave the regulator some leeway, but as of today there are still only four entities on <a href=\"https:\/\/register.fca.org.uk\/s\/search?predefined=CA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the crypto-assets register<\/a>.","\u201CThe clock is again ticking as we approach the new July deadline, whereby existing firms legally have to cease trading,\u201D wrote Taylor.","\u201CAdditionally, hundreds of new businesses have been waiting for months to progress their applications, with staff and overhead costs mounting, as they cannot start trading and earning revenues until their application has been approved,\u201D he continued.","CryptoUK also flagged a lack of access to banking services as a \u201Ccritical impediment\u201D to the industry\u2019s growth. The trade body represents some of the biggest names in crypto, including Binance's UK entity, eToro and Ripple.&nbsp;","The FCA declined to comment.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
