However, the team behind private CNH and Hong Kong dollar stablecoins was detained in May, according to SCMP.","Acknowledging the unlikelihood of mainland China embracing the broader cryptocurrency industry, Allaire said he remains optimistic about web3 development in the Hong Kong Chinese special administrative region and its regulatory approach toward stablecoins.","\u201CThe reality is that every other major financial market in the world is also embracing digital assets, and the biggest financial institutions in the world are embracing digital assets. So for Hong Kong to be relevant, it has to,\u201D Allaire said.","\u201CI think there is Chinese government support for that,\u201D he added. \u201CThat\u2019s different than feeling like it says something about opening up the trading of crypto on the mainland. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything there.\u201D","With concerns over the role of stablecoins once CBDCs are more widely available, Allaire said CBDCs are complementary and private stablecoins drive innovation.","\u201CIf central banks are going to upgrade their own systems to move away from legacy technology into more modern distributed ledger technology, that\u2019s great,\u201D he said. \u201CThere\u2019s a whole bunch of things that are useful from that, but I view that as very different than the work that the private sector does to innovate on the public internet.\u201D","The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plans to introduce stablecoin regulations by 2024 and the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong is developing complementary regulations. The Hong Kong government also recently set up a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/237483\/hong-kong-government-sets-up-web3-task-force-to-help-build-a-thriving-ecosystem\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">web3 task force<\/a> to help Hong Kong\u2019s desire to reestablish itself as a global hub for the crypto industry.","\u201CWe\u2019re excited that this is a priority for the Hong Kong government and it seems like it\u2019s a real priority for the HKMA,\u201D Allaire said. \u201CThat\u2019s tremendously positive and is really motivating for us to want to be able to grow our business here.\u201D","Last month, Allaire <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236571\/circle-sets-sights-on-hong-kong-sees-enormous-demand-for-digital-dollars\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> he was paying close attention to regulatory developments in Hong Kong and saw \u201Cenormous demand for digital dollars\u201D in the region.","Circle\u2019s USDC is the second-largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin behind Tether\u2019s USDT, with a circulating supply of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/usdc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$21.5 billion<\/a>, according to CoinGecko data.","Â© 2023 The Block.
