The FTC said he lied about customers\u2019 funds being protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.","\u201CEhrlich and Voyager lied to Voyager customers,\u201D said Ian McGinley, the CFTC\u2019s enforcement director, in a statement about the suit, which calls for restitution, penalties and industry bans for the former executive. \u201CWhile representing they would treat customers\u2019 digital asset commodities safely and responsibly, behind the scenes, they took shockingly reckless risks with their customers\u2019 assets, leading to Voyager\u2019s bankruptcy and huge customer losses.\u201D","However, one of the agency's commissioners, Caroline Pham, argued the CFTC's position that the company should have registered as a commodity pool operator is a bad interpretation of the law.","The enforcement action's definition of commodity pools \u201Cwould seem to include commonplace lending activity\u2014like taking deposits and providing loans,\u201D she said in a statement on Thursday. \u201CSuch an interpretation is an overreach beyond our statutory authority and would disrupt well-established legal and regulatory frameworks for lending to institutions and consumer finance.\u201D","The CFTC also took the opportunity to put on the record assets it considers commodities \u2013 as the agency has done in other recent cases, saying \u201Ccertain digital assets are \u2018commodities,\u2019 including BTC, USDC, and others.\u201D","The FTC also settled with the company in an agreement that permanently bans Voyager from handling customers\u2019 assets, hitting it with a $1.65 billion judgment that is suspended to allow the firm to continue its liquidation to pay back its customers.","\u201CThis action reminds companies and individuals: Don\u2019t play fast and loose with claims about FDIC insurance,\u201D said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.","After Voyager collapsed in July 2022, the crypto lender first negotiated a doomed deal to sell to FTX, and then another arrangement for sale to Binance fell apart. Former Voyager customers may not recover more than 36% of their assets, according to estimates.","Read More: Voyager Creditors Billed $5.1M for March-May by Law Firm","UPDATE (October 12, 2023, 18:49 UTC): Adds comment from CFTC's Caroline Pham.","UPDATE (October 12, 2023, 19:12 UTC): Adds CFTC's claim of BTC and USDC as commodities.","Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."],"entity":[{"type":"Samuel Levine","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$5.1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.65 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ian McGinley","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October 12, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Federal Trade Commission (FTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Voyager Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Steve Ehrlich","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ehrlich","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Caroline Pham","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Federal Deposit Insurance Corp","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FDIC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aoyon Ashraf","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"36%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"USDC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Circle","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Voyager Digital","Stephen Ehrlich","CFTC","Commodity Futures Trading Commission","Federal Trade Commission","Lawsuit","Enforcement"],"authors":["Jesse Hamilton"]}
