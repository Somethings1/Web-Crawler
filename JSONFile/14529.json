But 2024\u2019s matchup in the Karate Combat Pit takes the dueling to a new level.","Crypto influencers Nic Carter and David Hoffman are set to go toe-to-toe on May 30 during this year\u2019s conference in Austin, Texas.\n\n\u201CInfluencer Fight Club 2\u201D is the part of the increasingly popular Karate Combat series, essentially a no-holds-barred version of UFC without the (time-wasting) on-mat grappling.\n\nCarter, co-founder of data analytics leader Coin Metrics and VC fund Castle Island Ventures, will represent Bitcoin, while Hoffman, the founder of media platform Bankless, will fly the colors for Ethereum. The bout is two rounds of two minutes each, with a third round scheduled if a tiebreaker is needed.","Also on the card is Billy McFarland, the infamous Fyre Festival entrepreneur, who squares off against Alex, better known by his handle @shillin_villain.","\u201CI\u2019m very confident,\u201D said Carter, via X DMs. \u201CI\u2019ve never trained in martial arts before this and I don\u2019t think David has either. But we are both very fitness focused \u2013 which makes us a good matchup.\u201D\n\nBoth fighters have hired trainers to work on basic fighting skills and they\u2019re preparing hard around other day-to-day commitments.","The friends have a side bet where they\u2019ll donate $10,000 to the winner\u2019s chosen open-source development group. Carter\u2019s choice is the Bitcoin Core, which maintains the Bitcoin network. Hoffman\u2019s is Protocol Guild, the equivalent organization in the Ethereum community.","When the news leaked on X last week, several commenters made fun of the fighters\u2019 physiques and mocked their fighting skills. But the two are undeterred.\n\n\u201CAt the end of the day, it\u2019s me and David that are taking the risk and getting in the ring and all they can do is watch,\u201D Carter said. \u201CIf they want to fight they can try and get in the undercard, they are welcome to reach out to Karate Combat. But David and I aren\u2019t claiming to be amazing fighters. The objective is to entertain and take on a new challenge, not to begin decorated fight careers.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s been funny to hear all the haters who want to fight us,\u201D adds Hoffman. \u201CI have no interest in fighting anyone but Nic Carter.\u201D\n\nThis is the 46th Karate Combat event and the second under the banner \u201CInfluencer Fight Club (IFC).\u201D The first, featuring Ben \u201CBitBoy\u201D Armstrong and meme coin creator \u201CMore Light,\u201D in Mexico City in February, drew hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. BitBoy beat the more-fancied More Light in a match full of aggression and flanging fists and arms.","Karate Combat founder ONLYLARPING said he wants the format to \u201Cbe the first official sport of Web3.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt makes sense to partner with the biggest and best conferences in the world and the most entertaining influencers and founders.\u201D","Research by Karate Combat found that a large percentage of its audience don\u2019t enjoy sports unless there is a side-bet element to it. The platform has a no-loss gaming feature, where Karate token-holders plump for a winner and are given a small share of the prize money if they pick the right horse. If they pick the loser, they don\u2019t give up anything.","The Karate Combat series at Consensus features six influencer fights and 10 more conventional bouts involving professional fighters. The action begins May 30 at 7 pm local time. Weigh-ins take place May 29 at 5 pm on the Town Square stage.","Edited by Bradley Keoun."],"entity":[{"type":"Influencer Fight Club 2\u201D","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Carter","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Castle Island Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 29","content":"DATE"},{"type":"46th Karate Combat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"David Hoffman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Austin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Influencer Fight Club (IFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Billy McFarland","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hoffman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nic Carter","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UFC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ONLYLARPING","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Town Square","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"David","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mexico City","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Protocol Guild","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Texas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bradley Keoun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alex","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$10,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Karate Combat","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ben \u201CBitBoy\u201D Armstrong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"May 30","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Features","Consensus 2024"],"authors":["Ben Schiller"]}
