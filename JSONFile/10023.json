Ltd. received in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Paxos said late Wednesday. The new entity will issue a USD-backed stablecoin that will comply with Singapore's recently finalized stablecoin regulatory framework before the legislative amendments take effect.","In August, MAS <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244894\/singapore-watchdog-finalizes-stablecoin-rules\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">finalized<\/a> its framework for regulating stablecoins, applicable to single-currency stablecoins pegged to the Singaporean dollar or any G10 currency, including the U.S. dollar. Crypto firms aiming to recognize their stablecoins as \"MAS regulated stablecoins\" must comply with the framework.","\"Paxos is one of only two companies, alongside StraitsX, to get this approval from MAS,\" a Paxos spokesperson told The Block. \"We will issue a new stablecoin with all new branding. That's because it is done from Singapore.\"","Paxos does not yet have a name or specific details for the new stablecoin, aside from it being USD-backed and issued by the firm's new Singapore entity, the spokesperson said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Paxos already offers a USD-backed stablecoin called <span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248419\/pax-dollar-usdp-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Pax_Dollar.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">USDP<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_positive\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      +0.15%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span> from its home country, the United States. The Singapore entity was established to ensure compliance with local regulations and to facilitate partnerships with enterprise clients for issuing the USD-backed stablecoin in Singapore \u2014 similar to Paxos's PayPal partnership in the U.S.<\/span>","In August, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243569\/paypal-launches-stablecoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">PayPal launched<\/a> a USD-backed stablecoin called PYUSD, which is issued by Paxos. Binance was also once a Paxos partner for the crypto exchange's BUSD stablecoin. However, Paxos no longer mints BUSD after the New York Department of Financial Services <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210932\/paxos-will-no-longer-issue-binance-usd-stablecoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ordered<\/a> it to cease the stablecoin's issuance.","Paxos Digital Singapore Pte.

At that time, Paxos claimed to be the first U.S.-based crypto firm to obtain that license. That license enabled Paxos to onboard Singapore-based customers for its crypto brokerage platform, which allows them to buy, sell, hold, send, and receive cryptocurrencies, the spokesperson said today.","Paxos is backed by high-profile investors, including Bank of America, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Coinbase Ventures.
