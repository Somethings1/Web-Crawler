The case is seen by some as defining for artistic NFT collections that borrow elements of existing intellectual property. Hermès targeted the NFT artists\u2019 collection of 100 customized, digitized handbags similar to the original Birkin, which can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"While this might be an upsetting decision for many members of the NFT community, I think it's a signal that the art is being taken seriously,\u201D said Joshua James, co-founder of OneOf, which <\/span>creates and sells NFT trading cards based on \u201Ciconic\u201D brands. <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CDigital collectibles carry value to consumers, and they must be just as authentic and verified as the real-world items they emulate.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rothschild\u2019s \u201CMetaBirkins\u201D originally sold for about $450 before their value soared on to tens of thousands of dollars, according to Bloomberg.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NFTs originally caught fire among collectors thanks to artistic, profile-picture-like non-fungible token collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and Doodles. Since then, major corporations and brands have released lower-priced collections inspired by existing intellectual property like Nike shoes, the popular TV series \u201CGame of Thrones\u201D or Budweiser beer.<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhat\u2019s that great quote about art? \u2018Good artists copy, great artists steal,\u2019\u201D said Les Borsai, co-founder of Wave Financial, which manages an NFT fund. \u201CArt has always been connected to other derivatives. You can say we wouldn\u2019t have the music market we have today without samples.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fred Hsu, CEO of ClubID, a membership platform for web3 communities, backed the brand's position.<\/span>","\u201C<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I 100 percent side with the IP owner. The intent to sell art that almost identically resembles an existing product, and not even changing its name for the collection, was a blatant infringement,\u201D said Hsu \u201CIf these were bags being sold in the real world, there wouldn't have even been a doubt.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But some NFT advocates might argue that in a way MetaBirkins do exist in the real world, only as digital assets. Because in part, the advent of digital assets has meant that not being able to hold something in one\u2019s hand no longer precludes an object from having real-world value.<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhat we\u2019re seeing here with the Hermès lawsuit is the beginning of a deeper, much-needed conversation around how we legally categorize NFTs and what protections these digital collectibles, and their creators, should have in a court of law,\u201D said Inder Phull, CEO of Pixelnyx, a web3 music and gaming platform. \u201CThe court has decided that NFTs are not works of art, but rather more similar to consumer goods. I expect that as the web3 space matures and continues to integrate with mainstream culture, we\u2019ll come to a more nuanced perception of NFTs.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nihar <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Neelakanti<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> echoed James\u2019 positive sentiments. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe jurors determined something very positive for the space: that NFTs are more than art,\u201D said the CEO of Ecosapiens, a platform that aims to help people combat climate change with NFTs. \u201CThey are unique assets and technologies that can be protected under U.S. trademark or patent law.\u201D<\/span>","A substantial part of Hermès\u2019 lawsuit centered around the notion that Rothschild had damaged the Birkin brand.
