The past week alone witnessed a 19% surge in bitcoin open interest from active market participants, with futures premiums climbing, they said.","However, the derivatives market isn't entirely bullish. CME\u2019s ether open interest declined by 17% over the past week, with ether futures maintaining a relative premium discount to bitcoin as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/250795\/suspicious-bearish-ether-outlook-cme-k33-research\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> by the analysts last week.

Factors such as short squeezes, ETF news and sell-side pressures from bankruptcy estates and the U.S. government have emerged as dominant market influencers. This change is evident when observing bitcoin's correlation with traditional indices like the S&amp;P 500 and the DXY, which have notably diverged since the start of the year, the analysts said.","The U.S. Fed will announce its latest interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET today, with a pause at 5.5% expected. Despite potential short-term volatility during and post-meeting, any impact on the crypto markets will likely be short-lived Lunde and Helseth said, with the diminished correlation to traditional markets making macroeconomic data less relevant to current trading decisions.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BTC rolling correlation with the S&amp;P 500.
