The news comes a few days after some reports <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/107385\/solana-fundraise-450-million-ethereum-competitor\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> Solana could raise anywhere from $300 million to $450 million.","With fresh capital at hand, Solana Labs plans to launch an incubation studio to speed up the development of projects building on the Solana blockchain and set up a venture investing arm for the Solana ecosystem.","Launched last year, Solana is seen as a competitor to Ethereum, which today remains the largest blockchain platform for decentralized projects and applications. Solana, however, is faster and cheaper than Ethereum for executing transactions.","<a href=\"https:\/\/blockchair.com\/ethereum\/charts\/transactions-per-second\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum's current capacity<\/a> is about 15 transactions per second. <a href=\"https:\/\/solana.com\/news\/inside-solana-s-internal-scalability-test\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Solana's capacity,<\/a> on the other hand, is around 50,000 transactions per second. As for cost, <a href=\"https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/ethereum_average_transaction_fee\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum's average fee<\/a> per transaction is about $6, while <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/solana\/status\/1334000498630823938?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Solana's is around $0.00001<\/a>. (Ethereum's fees are expected to drop when it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/85771\/eth2-phase-0-roll-out-long-way-to-go\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">moves to a proof-of-stake system<\/a>).","\"We are convinced that scalability and throughput in blockchain are now a solved problem,\" said Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs. \"The next phase is onboarding a billion users.\"","The number of projects <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/107394\/gts-solana-data-project-market-maker\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">building on Solana<\/a> is increasing. There are already more than 90 projects in Solana's ecosystem, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/mapping-out-solanas-ecosystem-96721\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as The Block Research reported<\/a> earlier this year. Some of the most notable projects include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/72924\/ftx-dex-serum-solana-blockchain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Serum<\/a>, Raydium, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/91563\/maps-me-50m-seed-alameda\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Maps.me<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/100875\/jump-trading-defi-oracle-solana\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pyth Network.<\/a>","Still, Solana has a long way to go. The total value locked (TVL) in Solana's DeFi ecosystem is currently way smaller than Ethereum's. <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The TVL of Ethereum projects<\/a> is over $59 billion, whereas <a href=\"https:\/\/solanaproject.com\/#\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the TVL of Solana projects<\/a> is less than $1 billion.","Solana could \"massively scale\" the DeFi ecosystem, according to Polychain Capital's managing partner Olaf Carlson-Wee. \"In our view, Solana is a compliment to Ethereum,\" he said. \"We're thrilled to see strong developer activity and a continually expanding community grow around the project.\"","The private token sale round brings Solana Labs's total funding to date to more than $335 million. The project has previously raised $20 million in a Series A in 2019 and $1.8 million via CoinList last year.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
