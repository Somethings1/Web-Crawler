With the direction integration, Binance users will have faster access to funds for trading.","Binance said it has assigned users ETH deposit addresses on the Arbitrum One network. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/116148\/ethereum-scaling-solution-arbitrum-launches-mainnet-raises-120-million-funding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Arbitrum One<\/a> is live on mainnet but is still in a beta phase.","Binance will also enable withdrawals on Arbitrum at a later date, said the exchange, without specifying a timeline. Once that option is enabled, Binance users will be able to withdraw their funds on Arbitrum faster and at a much cheaper cost.","Arbitrum, being a Layer 2 network, helps reduce transaction costs using Optimistic rollups technology. Rollups allow executing Ethereum transactions off-chain, thereby reducing the network congestion, increasing its speed, and reducing gas fees.","Binance is one of a few major centralized exchanges that have completed integrating a Layer 2 network. OKEx has also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.okex.com\/support\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360060706511\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">integrated<\/a> Arbitrum's network. Coinbase recently <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/coinbase-protocol-team-advances-crypto-community-aa9b3748bac5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> its plans to integrate Polygon's Layer 2 network but is yet to support it. Coinbase has also said that it will explore Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starkware's Layer 2 networks over time.","Decentralized protocols, on the other hand, such as Uniswap, 1inch, and Aave, have integrated Arbitrum's and other Layer 2 technologies into their platforms.","Binance's Arbitrum integration comes at a time when Binance Smart Chain (BSC) validators are complaining that the network is poorly run.","\"BSC is a lost cause,\" one GitHub user <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/binance-chain\/bsc\/issues\/553\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">posted<\/a> earlier this week, for instance. \"There is zero responding to bug reports. Hundreds of people report non syncing nodes or nodes falling out of sync. Response from the 'developers' - zero.\""],"hashtag":["ARBITRUM","BINANCE","ETHEREUM"]}
