Based in New York City, Fuul automates affiliate marketing between web3 brands and creators using blockchain.&nbsp;","\"Every affiliate program on the Fuul protocol is a smart contract itself,\" Leandro 'Locha' Schlottchauer told The Block in an interview. He's the co-founder and CEO of Kuyen Labs, the developer of the Fuul protocol. Fuul handles distribution, attribution as well as payouts as the referrals are settled on-chain, he added.","Fuul charges an 8% fee on top of affiliate commissions, and it's currently compatible with EVM networks.","Fuul <a href=\"https:\/\/a16zcrypto.com\/crypto-startup-school\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">underwent<\/a> a16z's Crypto Startup School this year, in which the crypto-focused venture firm provides startups with mentorship and networking opportunities. Fuul earned additional support from DCG Expeditions, the investment arm of DCG that focuses on funding early stage firms.&nbsp;","Fuul raised funding from angel investors for an undisclosed amount that \"got the lights on\" and provided a payroll for engineers, Schlottchauer said. The Fuul team is now comprised of eight people. The firm hopes to have an official seed fundraise sometime next year.&nbsp;","Fuul's immediate plans include adding more engineers, onboarding more web3 builders onto the platform and starting on a path toward decentralization, especially for the attribution.&nbsp;","\"It would be definitely a long path toward decentralization, but something that we really want to achieve,\" Schlottchauer said. \"We think that the mission for Fuul is only achieved if the protocol is decentralized.\"","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Correction: Fuul is the protocol that Kuyen Labs is developing.&nbsp;<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
