But non-crypto natives are now realizing the wider possibilities of stablecoins, and the expansion of use cases is particularly visible when it comes to offering regulated stablecoins in a local currency such as the Japanese yen, according to Anchorage co-founder Diogo Mónica.","\u201CThink about a ride hailing firm or food delivery company, or payroll or remittances.

We have the clearest answers because we are a regulated federal bank.\u201D","Read more: Anchorage Digital to Introduce Ether Staking for Institutions as Move to PoS Approaches"],"entity":[{"type":"Anchorage Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"USDT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"GMO-Z.com Trust Company","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Diogo Mónica","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Anchorage","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"DFS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FDIC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New York State Department of Financial Services","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GMO Internet Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mónica","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Anchorage","Stablecoin","Japan"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
