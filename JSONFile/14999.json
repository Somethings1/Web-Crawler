BlockFi followed a well-worn path \u2013 it suspended withdrawals earlier this month and (we know now) hired a consultant to sort through its processes.","Like (so far) every other crypto company, BlockFi has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, indicating it believes it can continue onwards after a restructuring process. Like other companies, BlockFi claims it faced \u201Ca severe liquidity crunch,\u201D directly citing the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange as a main cause.

The Terra collapse likewise hurt the company.","BlockFi does hope to continue operating, although it reportedly plans to lay off staff.","Also, the company is suing Sam Bankman-Fried to secure control over Robinhood shares the former FTX CEO apparently pledged as collateral to the lender on Nov. 9.","There\u2019s a number of events we\u2019re watching this week tied to the general meltdown of the last month:","Key: (nom.) = nominee, (rum.) = rumored, (act.) = acting, (inc.) = incumbent (no replacement anticipated)","N\/A","If you\u2019ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you\u2019d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Twitter @nikhileshde.","You can also join the group conversation on Telegram.","See ya\u2019ll next week!"],"entity":[{"type":"earlier this month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Robinhood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Celsius Network","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"State of Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$10 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Nov. 9","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Celsius Network Ltd.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$257 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Voyager Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"several days earlier this month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UST","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Newsletters","State of Crypto","BlockFi","Bankruptcy"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De"]}
