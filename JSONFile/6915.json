At least one of the 15 scam tokens prevents holders from selling their tokens, known as a honeypot. Most of these tokens have 100% selling taxes, which is a way to steal all funds when buyers try to move funds, PeckShield noted.","PeckShield advised that users should stay vigilant and cautious of these fake tokens. \"The scammers are always taking advantage of new and emerging applications to trick innocent users for profit. And we need to keep an eye on these fake tokens and stay alert,\" said Xuxian Jiang, founder and CEO of PeckShield, in a statement to The Block.","The Damus team also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/damusapp\/status\/1621533861581824001\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued<\/a> a statement, warning users. \"Damus does not have a token and will never have a token. If you bought a DAMUS token you have been scammed,\" it tweeted.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
