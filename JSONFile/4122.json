Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of January 2023, it has over 138 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.7 billion total transactions, and over $11.0 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government\u2019s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (\u201CDMC\u201D), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica\u2019s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/tron.network\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TRONNetwork<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/trondao.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TRONDAO<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TRONDAO\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC5OPOGRq02iK-0T9sKse_kA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">YouTube<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/tronnetworkEN\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Telegram<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/tron\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Discord<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Tronix\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reddit<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/tronprotocol\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">GitHub<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/trondao.medium.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Medium<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.trondao.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Forum<\/span><\/a><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Media Contact<\/span><\/i><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hayward Wong<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"5222203721211226203d3c7c3c3726253d2039\">[email&nbsp;protected]<\/a><\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by TRON and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
