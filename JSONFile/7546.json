It's done by those who are speculating that a project might do an airdrop. To do this, they spin up a lot of wallets and use the application in question across all the wallets, hoping that if each one receives the airdrop, they might make a lot of money.","Optimism said the tokens that would have been sent to these wallets will be redistributed among the remaining eligible wallets.","\"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Optimism is for the people, not the sybils,\" Optimism said on Twitter.<\/span>","Airdrop farming has hit several previous crypto projects. The most high-profile case was when Divergence Ventures used a lot of addresses to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/120824\/vcs-pre-farming-defi-projects-raises-questions-about-ethics-in-crypto-investing-and-aidrops\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">try to game<\/a> the Ribbon Finance airdrop, a project that it had earlier invested in.

It is only handing out 5% of its total supply of tokens, with a further 14% designated for future airdrops. The remaining tokens will be spread among an ecosystem fund, public goods funding, its core contributors and private investors.","In Optimism's Discord server, an Optimism contributor known as NoobMan <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/channels\/667044843901681675\/968498016417902673\/976125478349987890\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> the token distribution was likely to happen at the end of May or in June.","Â© 2023 The Block.
