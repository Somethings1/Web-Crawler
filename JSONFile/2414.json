At least half a dozen lenders and borrowers \u2014&nbsp;ranging from the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital to lenders like BlockFi, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital \u2014&nbsp;collapsed into bankruptcy last year.","Trident hopes to restore some of the liquidity that has drained out of the lending market, according to an announcement this morning.","To get started, it raised $8 million in a seed round co-led by White Star Capital and New Form, with CMT Digital, Joint Effects and Permit Ventures also participating.","\u201CCounterparty risk, largely ignored in the last cycle, has become the key constraint preventing lenders from re-entering the market.

Toby Norfolk-Thompson, Trident\u2019s chief commercial officer, worked with DeMartino at Coinbase as chief investment officer of Coinbase Risk Strategies and at Matrixport as chief investment officer in the U.S. and UK.","Trident will launch with a yield product that ties yields to the risk-free rate while ensuring treasuries physically back any deposits, according to today\u2019s announcement. The startup hopes to win deposits from fintech firms, crypto native treasuries and venture capitalists."],"hashtag":[]}
