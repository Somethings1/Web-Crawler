It also said that if a merger or acquisition does not take place on time, it could halt operations permanently.","In the bankruptcy petition, filed on Oct. 24, employees of CX Technologies claim that they have not been paid their salaries for September or October 2019 and some have not received benefits for even longer, as well as that the company has no money left in its bank accounts. The company\u2019s owner, Pinhas Patarkazishvili, apparently agreed with this assessment and allowed the bankruptcy proceedings to go forward.","The petition also claims that CX Technologies is a successor company to SpotOption, which was raided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in January 2018 over suspicions that it was involved in Israel\u2019s multibillion-dollar binary options scam. The petition also claims that most of CX Technologies\u2019 55 employees are former employees of SpotOption.","DX.Exchange was indeed<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ccn.com\/is-dx-exchange-a-sham-crypto-platform-for-us-stock-trading-linked-to-shady-spotoption\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> linked to SpotOption<\/a> earlier this year, as Limor Patarkazishvili (Pinhas' wife), the sole shareholder of DX.Exchange, owned 90% of binary options platform SpotOption. DX.Exchange has in the past denied any connection to SpotOption, while SpotOption has denied all allegations of wrongdoing, per the Times of Israel report.&nbsp;","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Suppliers have also sued<\/strong><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nIn addition to the petition by employees, several Israeli suppliers have also sued CX Technologies in the last six months for allegedly failing to pay its bills. These companies include White Hat Ltd., which provided cybersecurity services to DX.Exchange; Bee2See Dotan B.S. Solutions, which provided targeted marketing of potential customers; and Malam Team, which supplied servers to the exchange, per the report, which adds that more creditors could come forward.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nDX.Exchange <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/15784\/europes-dx-exchange-makes-waves-by-listing-security-tokens-for-secondary-trading\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">was launched<\/a> in January, and also offered trading in cryptocurrencies as well as tokenized securities such as Tesla and Apple stock. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/45672\/nasdaq-powered-crypto-platform-dx-exchange-shuts-down-on-lookout-for-merger-or-acquisition\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block reported<\/a> earlier this month that the firm has now scrubbed any mention of tokenized securities from its platform.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nIn response, DX.Exchange CEO Daniel Skowronski told The Block at the time that he exchange has \u201Capplied for an MTF (multilateral trading facility) exchange license and about to be granted under a different entity.
