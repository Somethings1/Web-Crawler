However, if members are using other wallets for storage, they will be able to use a tool to transfer their tokens to the scaling network once the migration is complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: This article originally suggested the Layer 2 integration would be on the Ethereum mainnet, but it has been corrected to show the integration will initially be on testnet.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["ETHEREUM"]}
