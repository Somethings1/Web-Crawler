Analysts say this stagnation will persist in the short-term, regardless of pending decisions due from the Securities and Exchange Commission about applications for spot bitcoin ETFs.","The recent filings for the spot funds from financial institutions such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/240716\/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-long-shot\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlackRock<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241127\/fidelity-citadel-charles-schwab-edxm-talos\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fidelity<\/a> have sparked optimism, but it's not clear how long that enthusiasm can be sustained, as the SEC can delay the review process.
