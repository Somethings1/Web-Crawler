It offers guidance on a variety of platform related functions pertaining to overall stability, decentralization and risk, frontend governance, voter committees and delegates, and more.","For Maker, the proposal means a new level of detail and strategy will be implemented in terms of the long term management of the platform, accounting for risk, partnerships, voter and governance infrastructure and asset management.","The purpose of conservers is to protect Maker governance by \u201Cby ensuring it occurs according to the processes defined in the Maker Constitution,\u201D and will \u201Cenable MKR holders to participate in Maker Governance in a manner where it is easy for them to make the decisions that best benefit their long term interests as MKR holders, even if the MKR holders have relatively little alignment,\u201D according to the document.","Responsible for two critical governance roles as Constitutional Voter Committee members and Constitutional Delegates, constitutional conservers are to be anonymous. Conservers furthermore must take an oath to fight corruption, organizational drift, and other threats they may discover, and may be subject to additional requirements which may vary as their roles dictate, as described within relevant constitutional articles, the document said.","Among those MKR holders who wish to publicly coordinate, Voter committees allow for the engagement of voting strategies, political alignment, and for compromise to be found in accordance with the common grounds that lie between various voter groups.","Additional parameters in the document define a Constitutional Voter Committee, made up of constitutional conservers who contribute more than the minimum requirements to platform governance. These committees receive benefits, resources, and support but are held to specific requirements.","Certain constitutional conservers operate smart contracts related to the Protocol Delegation System, making them constitutional delegates, according to the constitution. They \u201Care eligible to receive significant income from the Maker Protocol \u2026 based on the number of votes delegated to them,\u201D as long as participation requirements are met.","The delegates are to refrain from involving themselves in MakerDAO operational activities, nor are they able to allocate resources from their delegacy toward operations, with the exception of allocations which have a charitable impact.&nbsp;","Delegates are encouraged to \u201Ccompete and campaign on their ability to achieve some level of charitable impact with the resources available to them, in order to demonstrate alignment with the public good purpose of the DAO,\u201D according to the constitution.","The constitution provides details for the launch of six subDAOs comprising two FacilitatorDAOs that manage governance, two ProtectorDAOs that manage real-world assets, and two CreatorDAOs focused on innovating decentralization.","For each subDAO a well developed community will be required, and to spur the cultivation of such groups, infrastructure and support will be provided.","Provisions were also laid out to provide project-based funding for professional actors who aren\u2019t classified as core units but still offer \u201Ccritical services for SubDAOs, and professional and expert services for Maker Core, or b2b services for other Ecosystem Actors,\u201D according to the document.","Â© 2023 The Block.
