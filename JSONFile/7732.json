He remained at Coinbase as a strategic consultant until leaving the company for good in December.","Feroz was hired in part to help steward several new crypto-specific products that BCB is planning to launch. He would not reveal what those products are, but he did note that that there are \u201Ca lot of emerging opportunities in DeFi\u201D.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
