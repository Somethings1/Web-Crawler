Robinhood expects to make the wallet \"generally available\" in early 2023 and will likely add NFT capabilities. One in-demand feature from crypto enthusiasts is the ability to view NFTs in the wallet app.","\"I think trading NFTs in-app is a little bit complicated with the recent Apple guidance, so we're keeping an eye on that, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said during the call. \"But I think it's highly likely that we'll add the ability to view NFTs and for people to custody them.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
