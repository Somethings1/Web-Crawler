It was, however, \"spending a disproportionate time and working capital focused on a segment that provided 10% of revenue and resulted in negative cashflow,\" said CEO Zach Bradford. He also said that the company was still \"pursuing the sale\" and has not executed a final agreement.","In connection with the reclassification of its energy business as discontinued operations, CleanSpark recorded an impairment charge of <span class=\"xn-money\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$1<\/span><span class=\"xn-money\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">0.6 million.<\/span>","CleanSpark&nbsp;had its most productive quarter yet in terms of bitcoin mined (964 BTC, a 7% increase over the previous quarter), but that was offset by the decline in bitcoin's value.
