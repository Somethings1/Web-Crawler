Other investors in the round included Kraken Ventures, Mirana Ventures, GSR and Amber Group.<\/span>","The size of the seed round was $5 million, Layer N co-founder Dima Romanov told The Block, adding that Founders Fund contributed $1.8 million of the total amount. The investment comes after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/226680\/founders-fund-pantera-executive\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Founders Fund hired Joey Krug<\/a>, former co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, as a partner in April.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/183819\/solana-scaling-protocol-layer-n-comes-out-of-stealth-mode\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Layer N was previously building a scaling network for Solana<\/a> but abandoned the blockchain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185083\/ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">after crypto exchange FTX collapsed<\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> last November.

Romanov now says, \"we never ended up taking any money\/ signing anything,\" and that the round was called off after the collapse of FTX.<\/span>","\"After FTX, we spent some time thinking and thought that for our product, it makes the most sense to build on Ethereum. But we still have a great relationship with the Solana team and projects,\" Romanov added.","When asked if Layer N is planning to launch its own native token, Romanov said there is no concrete plan for that yet.","Layer N is an Ethereum Layer 2 network that aims to help create an on-chain rival to the Nasdaq. It is specifically designed to scale financial applications on Ethereum. \"We spent two years building, talking to users, engaging institutional firms, and experienced first-hand the many challenges that protocols faced. We designed a novel Layer 2 to address those challenges and eliminate friction in performance and user experience, streamline institutional onboarding, and allow protocols to focus on what's most important to them, building a great product,\" Romanov said.","Layer N plans to deploy a public testnet \"in the coming weeks.\" It will then release Nord, a specialized exchange rollup, offering \"10-100x better throughput than existing scaling solutions, and sub-millisecond latency.\"","Layer N said Nord's on-chain infrastructure is comparable to existing centralized exchanges from a performance and user experience perspective. Node will allow decentralized exchanges to launch their own rollups to enable Binance\/ Coinbase-like performance, Romanov said, adding that \"no other product compares to that (latency and throughput wise).\"","\"Every rollup in Layer N ecosystem will be connected by a shared messaging layer; meaning that every rollup will be able to move liquidity and data between other Layer N rollups effortlessly and instantly,\" he noted.","The project added that it has already secured major liquidity partners and is beginning its process of talking with early-stage developers to grow its ecosystem ahead of its public release.","Â© 2023 The Block.
