First, the accounting lead mistakenly shared a link to the payout form with edit access to a public channel on the project\u2019s Discord Server. The hacker was able to use this edit access on the form to insert their address and a 76.5 ETH payment. The hacker then made this row invisible on the form.","This hidden row on the form escaped the team\u2019s notice during rechecks. It also was not picked up by the multi-signature signers who executed the transfers after data from the form had been sent to the airdrop tool on Safe. As such, the attacker\u2019s wallet received the 76.5 ETH payment. The hacker subsequently transferred the ether to two centralized exchanges \u2014 HitBTC and Binance \u2014 with 69.2 ETH ($110,000) going to the former and 7.3 ETH to the latter.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/192901\/constitutiondao2-selling-nfts-in-revived-bid-to-buy-us-constitution\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">PeopleDAO<\/a> says it is working with blockchain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/215206\/platypus-finance-says-french-police-took-suspected-hackers-into-custody\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">security experts like ZachXBT<\/a> and SlowMist to track the hacker. The team says it also reported the matter to U.S. law enforcement agencies as well as the exchanges used by the hacker. PeopleDAO offered a 10% white hat bounty to the hacker should they return the funds. The hacker has not responded to this offer as of the time of reporting.","The team said it's taking steps to avoid similar mishaps in the future. \u201CWe are improving our accounting and multisig education,\" the team told The Block. \u201CWe are embracing tools built on Safe that improve signer experience.\u201D","PeopleDAO says it is planning to host demo sessions with team members about how to use these tools to prevent a repeat occurrence.","Â© 2023 The Block.
