It\u2019s an allegation that has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/193165\/feds-investigating-ftx-founder-sbf-for-possible-market-manipulation-nyt\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sparked<\/a> a market manipulation inquiry by U.S. prosecutors.&nbsp;","You \u201Chave to be afraid of highly conflicted industry players working to destroy your assets,\u201D 3AC co-founder Su Zhu <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/zhusu\/status\/1600858153692057600\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> on Thursday, as part of a thread mooting that \u201CAlameda\/FTX + affiliated parties used their clients' assets and positions to orchestrate an elaborate attack\u201D on luna.&nbsp;","Zhu\u2019s criticism was joined by Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon, the creator of luna and TerraUSD. Kwon <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stablekwon\/status\/1600672756672053250\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> that Genesis Trading \u2014 crypto\u2019s largest prime brokerage that is facing its own liquidity crisis \u2014 purchased $1 billion of TerraUSD shortly before the crash, claiming that it wanted to participate in the Terra DeFi ecosystem. He asked openly whether these funds were provided to Alameda or Bankman-Fried in order to attack the token.","3AC\u2019s other co-founder, Kyle Davies, echoed this claim on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xBdvTBzZ5aU\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">podcast<\/a> with AnalyseAsia this week. He said that the funds handed to Genesis were given out to a market making firm that immediately sold the tokens in order to drop the price.","\u201CI made a lot of big mistakes this year. But this wasn't one of them. There's no evidence, because it didn't happen. Please, please, focus on your own house,\u201D Bankman-Fried said on Twitter on Friday, in response to a separate tweet thread from Zhu.","FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 11, with Chicago-based attorney John Ray taking over Bankman-Fried's role as CEO. There\u2019s currently a tussle between the U.S. and the Bahamas over the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy proceedings.","When Bankman-Fried responded to the allegations from Kwon and 3AC's founders, Zhu <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/zhusu\/status\/1601130827962011649\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">questioned<\/a> how SBF was able to know so much about Alameda\u2019s trades \u2014 when he had publicly <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2022\/11\/30\/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-sbf-says-did-not-commit-fraud-distances-himself-alameda-research\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> that he deliberately kept a distance from the firm.&nbsp;","Separately, the former FTX executive said on Friday <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/193619\/sam-bankman-fried-says-he-will-testify-before-congressional-committee\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">he's willing<\/a> to give evidence on the exchange's collapse to a U.S. congressional committee next week.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","© 2023 The Block.
