Holders of Bored Apes and Mutant Apes will be able to stake their NFTs and large amounts of ApeCoin in order to receive staking rewards. Over the next three years, 175 million ApeCoin ($794.5 million) will be <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/0xroborosCap\/status\/1568909618952417280\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">distributed<\/a> to stakers.","The core idea with the proposal is that a bug bounty program would provide more reassurance to ApeCoin holders that the staking implementation will go smoothly \u2014&nbsp;particularly in light of recent smart contract <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175403\/bnb-smart-chain-halted-amid-potential-bridge-exploit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">exploits<\/a>.&nbsp;","On the governance forum, many voices were in agreement with the idea but asked why it hadn\u2019t been baked in from the start. \u201CGreat idea! Where the heck was this idea MONTHS ago though? Yet another thing to throw at staking to delay it \u2026 smh,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.apecoin.com\/t\/aip-draft-bug-bounty-program-for-aip-21\/8792\/7\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> one forum member.&nbsp;\u201CI echo this statement. Why are we just now drafting this idea this late in the game? I am really not in favor of delaying staking any further,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.apecoin.com\/t\/aip-draft-bug-bounty-program-for-aip-21\/8792\/20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">added<\/a> another.","The whole staking process has already been delayed multiple times. Currently, staking is tentatively scheduled to go live on October 31. If the proposal gets passed, that could push the launch back to early December.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
