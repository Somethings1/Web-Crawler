The aggregator doesn\u2019t charge users fees, and it has integrations with the majority of EVM-compatible chains. The aggregator also allows users to transact privately by routing transactions through its own server, which doesn\u2019t store IP data.","Many DEXs have turned to liquidity mining programs over the past two years to try and attract users. That model, however, hasn\u2019t been conducive to long-term growth and sustainability, as Sushiswap noted in its latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/198569\/sushiswap-tries-to-breathe-life-back-into-protocol-with-new-tokenomics-proposal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tokenomics revamp proposal<\/a>.
