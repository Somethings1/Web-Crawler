Silvergate CEO Alan Lane confirmed last week that inbound payments from clients were having difficulties going through the system, while outbound payments were being processed manually via the system\u2019s backup infrastructure.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Going into this week, Silvergate clients continued to experience problems with such wires. TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, for instance, reported in a Monday <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/arrington\/status\/1242224588307615745?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweet<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that his funds had been locked for days.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In a Tuesday message to The Block, Lane said that Silvergate\u2019s system is now fully functional.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We are back to 100% capacity,\" Lane said. \"We were able to get reconnected to the Fed Monday morning, and first cleared the queue of all outgoing wires from Friday. At the same time, all API enabled wires (incoming and outgoing) were flying through seamlessly.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The problem that clients experienced yesterday, he said, was due to a persisting problem with wire transfers via its Business electronic Banking (BeB) system.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The only remaining snag yesterday was the more \u2018manual\u2019 wire transfer process through our BeB system \u2013 primarily utilized by customers who aren't as automated, i.e. they haven't coded to our API, perhaps because they don't have the high-volume need,\" he said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A partial internal report shared by Lane shows that around mid-day Monday, both incoming wires and incoming and outgoing API wire origination were at 100% capacity. With outgoing BeB origination, however, the system was still working on a batch upload process to deal with wire transfer requests submitted on Monday.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The problem with the BeB system has now been solved, according to Lane.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Silvergate is known for helping crypto-related clients with banking services. Its customer base \u2013 including exchange operators, institutional investors, and other customers \u2013 has increased by 40% year-to-date.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
