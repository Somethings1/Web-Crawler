Both arms of the EU legislature \u2013 the Council which groups member states, and lawmakers at the European Parliament \u2013 have approved their own versions of the text, in each case containing the controversial smart contract provisions.","But Donovan remains optimistic.","\u201CI'm hopeful that we will be heard, and that those modest requests will be accommodated,\u201D he said.","Read more: EU Parliament Passes Bill Requiring Smart Contracts to Include Kill Switch","Edited by Sandali Handagama."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Chris Donovan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU Parliament Passes Bill Requiring Smart Contracts to Include Kill Switch","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Donovan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fujitsu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Blockchain","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"European Crypto Initiative","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NEAR Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sandali Handagama","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","EU","EU Parliament","smart contracts"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
