World App, Worldcoin\u2019s crypto wallet, built on the Ethereum sidechain Polygon, is the first product from the elusive identity upstart that anyone, anywhere will be able to download.","The new app is one part minimalist crypto wallet, and one part passport for the AI era. It\u2019s Worldcoin\u2019s biggest swing yet to redefine itself in the eyes of consumers.","Worldcoin\u2019s initial rollout was rocky. The retina-scanning metal \u201Corb\u201D that the project used to authenticate new users was criticized as dystopian, and a damning expos√© from the MIT Technology Review forced Tools for Humanity \u2013 the company behind Worldcoin \u2013 to confront allegations of exploitation and deceptive recruiting practices.","Weathered by negative press coverage and a tumultuous year for the wider crypto industry \u2013 and amid an AI boom kicked off, in large part, by Altman\u2019s Open AI \u2013 Worldcoin reasserted itself in March with a repackaged vision focused on \u201Cproof of personhood.\u201D Announced in March, Worldcoin\u2019s World ID protocol will allow app developers to leverage its network of biometrically-authenticated humans.","\u201CEverything that has happened with AI in the last six months has made people understand the project a lot better,\u201D said Tiago Sada, the head of product at Tools for Humanity.","For those without a World ID, who\u2019ve yet to peer into one of Worldcoin\u2019s retina-scanning orbs, World App will function as a stripped-down crypto wallet \u2013 not too dissimilar from Coinbase Wallet, Metamask, or any number of other apps that allow people to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrency.","\u201CYou would probably find even fewer features on World App, actually, than on some of those wallets \u2013 and that's deliberate,\u201D explained Sada.","Tools for Humanity has global ambitions, and it says it designed its wallet app to be more accessible than other wallet services. To avoid overwhelming new crypto users, the app opts for a sleek, \u201Cminimalist\u201D design, boasts a relatively bare-bones feature set, and is somewhat restricted in the number of crypto tokens that it supports.","Built on Polygon \u2013 a blockchain that can send and receive assets from Ethereum but offers cheaper fees to users \u2013 World App currently offers access to \u201Cwrapped,\u201D Polygon-based versions of Bitcoin, Ethereum and stablecoins like the U.S. dollar-pegged DAI token (Worldcoin says more tokens are coming soon).","\u201CI think this really meets that need of keeping all of the really important guarantees of privacy and self custody of crypto, but in a way that's just super friendly \u2013 as friendly as custodial services\u201D that store crypto on a customer\u2019s behalf, explained Sada.","All of the aforementioned features will be available to anyone who downloads World App. For those in possession of a verified World ID, World App will serve as a kind of digital passport \u2013 granting retina-scanned humans access to apps and services gated to World ID holders.","There aren\u2019t many applications that leverage Wolrdcoin\u2019s identity protocol yet, but if you squint, you might be able to imagine the future envisioned by Sada \u2013 where World ID is weaved into the very fabric of blockchain and the broader web.","As for where World ID could be useful one day, \u201Ca big pocket is financial services,\u201D says Sada. \u201CFor example, there are things like undercollateralized lending in DeFi that really haven\u2019t been possible because there is no sense of identity.\u201D","Sada is also excited about applications around voting and social media account authentication. \u201CWhether you're talking about voting on a poll on something really dumb on Twitter, or voting for something much more serious, there's a lot of really interesting voting applications there,\u201D he said.","World App will provide a gateway for World ID users to claim their allotment of Worldcoins, though the token remains unavailable to claim in the United States for regulatory reasons and the mechanics of the claim process elsewhere remain somewhat vague. \u201CWe are generally not able to talk a lot about the Worldcoin token right now,\u201D Sada said.","Although the perks of having a World ID remain mostly theoretical in May, 2023, Tools for Humanity is offering World ID early adopters at least one benefit: World ID holders will be allowed to transact on World App without fees.","A Beta version of the World App has already been available to World ID holders for several months. \u201CSince its initial debut, 1.5 million people have joined the beta, more than 500,000 of which use it every month,\u201D Tools for Humanity said in a statement. \u201COn a typical day, it sees around 60,000 transactions and 25,000 World ID checks from over 100,000 people around the world.\u201D According to Tools for Humanity, its new wallet app is \u201Calready one of the most popular ways to access crypto today.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Humanity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Polygon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"MIT Technology Review","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Worldcoins","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sam Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May, 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tiago Sada","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tools for Humanity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sada","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coinbase Wallet","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Silicon Valley","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["worldcoin","AI","Identity"],"authors":["Sam Kessler"]}
