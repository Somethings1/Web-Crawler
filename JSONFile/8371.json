{"summary":"The American University of Beirut has developed a new curriculum for cryptocurrency over the past year.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/154381\/lebanons-university-students-turn-to-crypto-as-hyperinflation-roils-the-country","publishDate":"2022-06-27T16:48:58","id":8371,"type":null,"title":"Lebanon\u2019s university students turn to crypto as hyperinflation roils the country","category":["TECHNOLOGY"],"content":["<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In a tan stone building with a widescreen view of the Mediterranean, the American University in Beirut houses the premier business school in the Middle East.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the Suliman S. Olayan School of Business has fallen on hard times, as has the rest of the country.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Last year, a gunfight broke out between Hezbollah and Christian-backed militias over investigations into the Beirut port explosion. Many feared a return of the bloody civil war of the 80s. AUB canceled midterms.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mercifully, Lebanon did not descend into war. But the crisis continues. For AUB, pound-denominated tuition and professors\u2019 salaries have dropped by roughly 90%. While Beirut has long been one of the Arab world\u2019s cultural hubs, recent years have seen Lebanon\u2019s economy racked by cronyism, corruption and some of the worst hyperinflation in the world.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Lebanese lira remains officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1,500 to 1, but the black-market exchange <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lirarate.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rate<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is more like 30,000 to 1. And banks have indefinitely frozen customer withdrawals on pre-crisis dollar accounts, cratering faith in them as an institution.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Amid such a crisis, Lebanon\u2019s future business leaders are turning to blockchain tech.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe crazy thing is,\u201D says Harry Halpin. \u201CWalking through Beirut, it doesn\u2019t feel like chaos. It feels like this could totally happen in New York.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A founding programmer of privacy-focused Nym Technologies, Halpin, an American, found himself in residence at the beginning of last semester. He taught the inaugural \u201CBlockchain for Business\u201D course.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The blockchain program is new to the university. By his own account, Halpin drew inspiration from current chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler\u2019s courses at MIT, which Halpin took while working at the university.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The first semester of the blockchain course culminated in several students pitching LebAid, a platform for refugee remittances, to the business school\u2019s start-up accelerator.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A hackathon at the end of May saw competing teams, including a third of the undergraduate students from the fall semester, propose solutions for Lebanon\u2019s particular problems. One team that is now in the university\u2019s incubator program put together a system of prepaid cards, which scratch off to reveal private keys granting holders access to USDT wallets with small balances.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The new curriculum was enough of a success that the university has expanded, adding a DeFi module for professionals starting in July, and aiming to set up separate courses for graduate students with more of a programming background.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhat you really need is skilled programmers who can apply those skills to practical problems that they understand better than anyone else, in the language they speak \u2014 like Arabic,\u201D Halpin says.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meanwhile, however, the AUB is struggling to maintain its current staffing, given the collapsing value of professor salaries. The university is even considering switching its tuition from pounds to dollars \u2014 which would then make it prohibitive for a huge chunk of prospective students.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
