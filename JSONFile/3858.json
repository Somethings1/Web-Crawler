Trash bags and burned rubble littered the city of romance, as tens of thousands of protestors swarmed the streets (not, thankfully, to protest the conference or crypto more generally.)","Just as the bear market was unexpected, the conference organizers were likely not betting on holding proceedings amid nationwide protests against legislation to raise the retirement age.","Nevertheless, the unrest was somewhat fitting, given the state of crypto \u2014 a sector rocked by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/190311\/digital-currency-groups-genesis-global-files-for-bankruptcy-protection\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bankruptcies<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222286\/do-kwon-terra-luna-arrested-montenegro\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">arrests<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/223013\/bitcoin-plunges-binance-cftc-lawsuit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">market chaos<\/a> over the past six months.","As its penultimate day closed, the demonstrations were even close to bumping into the usually cloistered crypto crew as protestors marched past the Louvre.","Those demonstrations may have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-65064510\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">postponed<\/a> the king of England\u2019s trip to France, but they didn\u2019t stop corporations from Google, Amazon and Reddit showing their faces.","It\u2019s a different picture from 2019, when only 1,500 people attended the event, recalled market maker Woorton CEO and PBW co-founder Charlie Meraud. In its early days, he straddled both his leadership role at the market maker and organized the event before it hired a wider team as it grew.","\u201CI was quoting markets in the day, and I was literally chasing speakers during the night,\u201D he laughed.","Although blockchain has lost some of its buzz to AI, the conference has now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222649\/london-paris-crypto-conference-hotspot\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">swelled<\/a> to 8,500 attendees.&nbsp;","PBW has grown alongside the French ecosystem, the roots of which can be partly traced back to the 2014 founding of La Maison du Bitcoin by serial entrepreneur Eric Larchevêque and Thomas France, said crypto wallet giant Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier. Larchevêque and France went onto found Ledger.&nbsp;","\u201CEric was like \u2018I\u2019m going to create a hub for crypto,\u2019 which basically had no business model. It was like a WeWork for crypto,\u201D said Gauthier. \u201CBut very quickly it became a physical address where you could actually go and buy bitcoin with cash and credit card and it was running meetups and hackathons too.\u201D","La Maison du Bitcoin later evolved into the crypto investment platform Coinhouse in early 2018. A hackathon that took place at the venue later resulted in the creation of Ledger in 2015.&nbsp;","Today, many of France\u2019s homegrown brands can be found discussing the benefits of blockchain at PBW. Insurance company AXA, football club PSG and fashion houses such as LVMH, Kering and Givenchy rubbed shoulders with the usual crypto conference crop of Animoca Brands Chairman Yat Siu, Tim Draper and Circle\u2019s Jeremy Allaire.","Key crypto players in the French capital that The Block spoke to during the conference say that this collusion of corporations, culture and crypto is unique to France\u2019s ecosystem. Its sovereign wealth fund Bpifrance buttresses many of the interactions, claims PBW\u2019s Amar.","Last year, The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/142415\/france-emerge-europe-crypto-hub-succeed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">spoke<\/a> to Bpifrance's crypto lead Ivan De Lastours who said that the French ecosystem was able to lean on its strong reputation in the creative industries from gaming to film to fashion.&nbsp;","But that wasn\u2019t always the case, recalls Pierre Nicolas Hurstel, co-founder and CEO of Arianee, a firm that provides infrastructure for luxury brands looking to delve into web3.","He says that the startup only targeted the luxury sector as it recognized that web3 could solve some of the pain points of scarcity, ownership and transferability that the industry was experiencing.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Its flagship Digital Passport NFT is minted on its eponymous protocol and linked to a luxury good so that holders can not only validate its authenticity but also trace the product\u2019s life cycle including repairs, resells and ownership transfers.","Luxury Swiss watch brand Vacheron Constantin was Arianee\u2019s first target and, thanks to some risk-taking decision-makers at the firm, it trialed the passport in 2019.&nbsp;","\u201CPeople inside the company fought to make it work,\u201D he said, describing his first meetings with the wallet brand. It took until the end of 2021 for Vacheron Constantin to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/posts\/arianee_today-arianee-is-proud-to-announce-that-activity-6730101884956237824-OtnP\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">roll<\/a> it out product-wide.&nbsp;","That\u2019s just one example of what Ledger\u2019s Gauthier terms as a \u201Cvery organic\u201D and two-sided connection between France\u2019s luxury sector and crypto.","Crypto firms have also cozied up to the luxury sector during events such as last month\u2019s NFT Paris and at startup campus Station F\u2019s incubator programs, run by the likes of LVMH and L\u2019Oréal.","Despite the glitz, it hasn\u2019t been all luxury NFT drops and Punks in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210635\/punks-in-the-pompidou-yuga-labs-donates-second-cryptopunk-in-three-months\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pompidou<\/a> for the French ecosystem over the past year.","Its OG player Coinhouse was caught up in the crypto cataclysm of last year.

A milder set of licensing rules for crypto firms <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/215461\/france-passes-new-crypto-registration-rules\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">passed<\/a> last month, however.","There are also questions left to be answered on the results of headline-grabbing statements made by Crypto.com and Binance last year, which put forward millions in investment to the French ecosystem.","PBW\u2019s Amar said that he isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s going on with those arrangements, admitting that there was less presence from exchanges this year than before.&nbsp;","A Binance spokesperson told The Block that France continues to be the center of the exchange's activities in Europe. Binance continues to roll out the \u20AC100 million investment it announced last year, creating 150 jobs in the country and opening an office in Paris, the spokesperson continued.&nbsp;","Crypto.com did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&nbsp;","More recently the ecosystem had to deal with USDC de-pegging as Silicon Valley Bank collapsed.","\u201CJust like with banks we\u2019re now realizing that things we thought couldn\u2019t collapse can,\u201D said market maker Flowdesk\u2019s Guilhem Chaumont. The firm offers crypto market making as a service for token issuers.","As fashion and art solidify their blockchain bonds with the French capital, infrastructure is playing catch up.","Circle <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221432\/circle-applies-for-french-crypto-license\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">c<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221432\/circle-applies-for-french-crypto-license\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hose<\/a> the country as its EU headquarters while it looks to procure a full French license. But the idea of a Euro-denominated stablecoin gaining widespread adoption is still a pipe dream.","The share of Ethereum fiat stablecoin supply is close to 100% in USD stablecoins, per The Block Research.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/share-of-fiat-backed-stablecoin-supply-in-usd-by-currency\/embed\" title=\"Share of Ethereum Fiat Stablecoin Supply (in USD) by Currency\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","\u201CWe were expecting some strong inflow on the Euro side, but it hasn\u2019t been a huge shift. It would have been a good opportunity for a Euro stablecoin to shine,\u201D said Chaumont.","One of the most widely used euro stablecoins, Angle protocol's AgEUR, was also recently impacted by the Euler hack, <a href=\"https:\/\/gov.angle.money\/t\/moving-forward-with-angle-post-euler-hack\/647\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">leading<\/a> it to depeg.&nbsp;","Barring another bank run, if Circle manages to successfully register with the country\u2019s regulators, things could change \u2014 as it would be able to \u201Conshore\u201D its euro-backed stablecoin EUROC. &nbsp;","Still, French crypto startups like Flowdesk and Ledger claim that despite the sector's travails, things are going well.","\u201CWe had our best month in March,\u201D said Chaumont. \u201CWe onboarded eight or nine token issuers and we\u2019re at an all-time high in revenues and volume.\u201D","In November, when FTX collapsed, Ledger recorded its highest-ever revenue, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/192420\/ledger-device-ipod-inventor-tony-fadell\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claimed<\/a> Gauthier previously. And the luxury appetite for web3 shows no signs of going away either, said Hurstel.","Meanwhile, French president Emmanuel Macron is still struggling to quell the fire of his country\u2019s protestors. For now, the country\u2019s burning desire to become Europe\u2019s crypto hub also looks difficult to extinguish.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["CRYPTO BANKS AND LENDERS","USDC","WALLET MAKERS"]}
