That behind this is the trust that [there is in] the national currency.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, Carstens says that it is possible to improve the payment system without the need for a CBDC or digital currency, noting national payment systems like Brazil\u2019s Pix or Mexico\u2019s CoDi (the former is more widely used). Mexico recently said it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/128836\/mexican-government-signals-circulation-of-digital-currency-by-2024\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">planning to issue<\/a> its own CBDC by 2024.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In Carstens\u2019 view, stablecoins \u201Cgo more into the field of speculative assets.\u201D He also added: <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CDeFi is an avenue to go around the regulation, and therefore I think it has a limited reach.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">John Williams, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, emphasized that the U.S. needs a strong regulatory framework around cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe need a really effective regulatory structure around cryptocurrencies in general, and stablecoin[s], Williams said. \u201CI do think there\u2019s going to be an enormous amount of innovation going on in the financial system.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">U.S. President Joe Biden recently issued an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/136888\/bidens-executive-order-on-digital-assets-drops-in-four-hours-but-we-have-it-early\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">executive order<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> instructing the U.S. Treasury Department and other agencies to address risks and possible benefits of digital assets.
