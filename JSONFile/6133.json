The final Polygon 2.0 upgrade is expected next year.","The first among the three proposals, PIP-17, outlines \u201CPhase 0\u201D of Polygon 2.0. The primary aspect of this proposal is to ensure that no action will be required from end-users and developers on the existing Polygon PoS and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222950\/polygon-labs-unveils-zkevm-layer-2-scaling-solution\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygon zkEVM<\/a> chains during the upgrade.","Secondly, PIP-18 proposes the implementation of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239350\/polygon-upgrade-matic-tokens-to-pol\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">POL token<\/a>, which is intended to replace the existing MATIC token as the native gas and staking asset of the Polygon ecosystem.","Thirdly, PIP-19 calls for upgrading the native gas token on Polygon PoS from MATIC to POL in a manner that ensures maximum backward compatibility. This makes certain the upgrade to the new token will not alter smart contracts on Polygon PoS in terms of compatibility. The objective here is to ensure the upgraded POL token\u2019s code properties remains the same.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
