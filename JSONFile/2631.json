From 2013 to 2018 employees commonly received token compensation, with equity compensation nonexistent, the report also said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Variant and USV shied away from describing the new compensation method as a trend, but the survey did note the change as significant. \"While it may be too early to describe this as a trend, the data suggests that startups are experimenting with new incentive mechanisms that may be less reliant on tokens than in previous crypto market cycles,\" the report said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Approximately 50% of survey respondents say they compete almost entirely with other crypto startups for new hires,\" whereas 25% said they compete primarily with web2 organizations, according to the survey. \"This suggests that during a bear market, it\u2019s easier to recruit from within web3 than attract first-timers to join the crypto space,\" it added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Not surprisingly, with crypto still rapidly developing and becoming increasing integrated, engineers dominate headcount at the surveyed startups, accounting for 50% of staff. The engineers also tend to be paid better than in-house colleagues and their professional peers working outside crypto, according to Variant and USV. \"Senior-level web3 engineers earn a 23% premium, and early-career engineers earn 27% more than their counterparts in the general market,\" the survey said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Variant and USV also found that generally speaking, when compared to engineering staff, startups carry much fewer marketing and sales professionals. \"The relative lack of sales-focused roles is a reminder that web3 is still in its early building phase,\" wrote the survey\u2019s authors.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While 70% of the startups surveyed are headquartered in North America, more than half of employees are located outside the U.S., the report said. Companies retaining workforce outside of the U.S. is nothing new in crypto, but in the last few years the scope of geographic disbursement has increased, the survey found.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fifty-six percent \"of employees hired in 2020 or before 2020 are based in the U.S. But for employees hired in the past three years (2021-2023),\" that number fell to 46%, according to the report. <\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
