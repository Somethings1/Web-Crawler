It will also add Blockchain.com and BitGo to its network later this year.","Plaid asserts that it has seen a surging demand for crypto data portability as people seek to share crypto data alongside traditional holdings. The company, which specializes in connecting financial information across different apps and services, started offering KYC and identity verification services for crypto companies following its purchase of identity verification platform Cognito in January 2022.&nbsp;","However, users will not have access to the full suite of services Plaid usually provides.
