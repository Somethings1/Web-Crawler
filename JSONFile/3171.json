BCB Group\u2019s payments products in other currencies continue as usual.","\u201CIt\u2019s sad to see [Signature Bank] go, but hopefully we can provide continuity for our clients through three new U.S. bank relationships going live soon. We\u2019ll just have to accelerate those, mindful of how sustainable they\u2019ll be under the Fed\u2019s crypto-sceptic views,\u201D von Landsberg-Sadie said.","The interruption comes after a chaotic weekend in the U.S. banking sector that saw regulators step in to close down both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/218838\/silicon-valley-bank-closed-by-california-regulator\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Silicon Valley Bank<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/219119\/state-regulator-takes-control-of-signature-bank-federal-regulators-guarantee-deposits\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Signature Bank<\/a>. The former was first shut down by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation appointed as the receiver, on March 10. The New York Department of Financial Services then seized crypto-friendly Signature Bank in order \u201Cto protect depositors,\u201D the state banking regulator said in a Sunday night announcement.","In a joint statement after taking over Signature Bank, the Federal Reserve Board, Treasury Department and FDIC said, \u201CAll depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer.\u201D","Some BCB Group customers hold deposits with Signature Bank, von Landsberg-Sadie said, but he added that he has a \u201Creasonable expectation\u201D that they could be paid out as early as tomorrow, thanks to the regulator\u2019s intervention.","As to how likely it is, in the current climate, that BCB Group will locate not one but three new crypto-friendly banking partners in the U.S., von Landsberg-Sadie was optimistic \u2014 estimating the partnerships could be live within 4 to 12 weeks.&nbsp;","\u201CAs long as they have a solid capital structure, well hedged for interest rate volatility and as long as their AML control are rigorous enough to avoid FTX\/Alameda-type entity conflation, they should be OK,\u201D he said. He declined to disclose the names of potential partners.","BCB Group secured what it proclaimed as the UK crypto sector\u2019s largest ever Series A funding round in Jan. 2022, when it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bcbgroup.com\/bcb-group-raises-60m-in-series-a-funding-round\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">netted $60 million<\/a> from investors including Foundation Capital, PayU and a host of crypto-native investors.","The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/213972\/bcb-group-targets-valuation-of-200-million-in-new-fundraising-effort\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">revealed<\/a> in February that it was raising fresh funds through convertible notes with a pre-money valuation capped at $200 million. The startup\u2019s crypto-focused instant settlement network, BLINC, is effectively a European version of the Silvergate Exchange Network, a tool pioneered by Silvergate Bank \u2014 the first of three crypto-friendly U.S. banks to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/218223\/silvergate-will-liquidate-bank-wind-down-operations\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">topple<\/a> last week.","Â© 2023 The Block.
