Circle previously noted that, in addition to Ethereum and Avalanche, CCTP will be available on other blockchain networks in the future.","Circle's USDC is the second-largest stablecoin in the crypto market with a total supply of nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/usdc-supply-by-blockchain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$29 billion<\/a>.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/usdc-supply-by-blockchain\/embed\" title=\"USDC Supply by Blockchain\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","With CCTP, Circle has offered a more secure option for transferring stablecoins from one chain to another than what's available through cross-chain bridges. It allows for the flow of USDC across chains through a native mechanism of burning and minting, an approach that eliminates the need for wrapping-based bridges.","Typically, bridges enable users to move stablecoins between blockchains using \"wrapping,\" a mechanism considered somewhat vulnerable to hacks. Last year, a significant portion of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/196941\/the-biggest-crypto-hacks-of-2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto hacks<\/a> stole funds from bridges that relied on wrapping.","Wrapping in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies refers to the process of converting one cryptocurrency into another by creating a 1:1 pegged representation of the original asset on a different blockchain. This conversion allows users to move assets between blockchains.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">(Updates with additional background on bridges and wrapping.)<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
