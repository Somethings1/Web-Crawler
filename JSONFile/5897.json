UST's price, which was always supposed to be $1, fell below 10 cents and still hasn't recovered. It is now trading at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/terraclassicusd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">3 cents<\/a>, according to CoinGecko data. UST's sister token, luna, lost almost its entire value and is now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/terra-luna-classic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">trading at<\/a> a fraction of a cent.","As a result of the implosions, Terraform Labs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/149127\/terra-gets-second-life-as-new-blockchain-goes-live-with-luna-2-0-airdrop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> the new Terra blockchain, called Terra 2.0, over the weekend. It abandoned UST as part of the new blockchain and renamed the original luna tokens to \"luna classic\" (LUNC).&nbsp;","Per the JTBC report, prosecutors are looking at the whole matter, including whether CEO Do Kwon and other Terraform Labs executives neglected UST's design flaws. Prosecutors are reportedly also looking into whether local cryptocurrency exchanges went through a proper listing review before listing UST or luna.","Earlier this month, Korea's financial regulators \u2014 the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) \u2014 reportedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/147269\/south-korean-politician-calls-for-hearing-terra-do-kwon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> \"emergency inspections\" into local crypto exchanges to enhance investor protection.","The Block has reached out to Terraform Labs for comment on the JTBC report and will update this story should we hear back.","Â© 2023 The Block.
