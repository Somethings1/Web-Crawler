The fourth Bitcoin halving is expected to occur on April 26, 2024.","\"If the historical pattern established by the first three bitcoin halvings continues to play out with the fourth halving, then the pre-halving rally would begin about four months from now,\" the firm wrote. \"If a rally were to occur after the fourth halving, and if it were as long-lived as the rallies that occurred after the past couple of halvings, then it would continue until around October 2025.\"","\"If the fourth bitcoin halving features the kind of strong rally in the price of bitcoin that occurred prior to and following the first three halvings, then we believe it is likely that MSTR\u2019s stock would rally along with it; the correlation between the company\u2019s share price and the price of bitcoin is ~0.90,\" the firm added.","Microstrategy is up more than 181% since the beginning of the year, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/symbols\/NASDAQ-MSTR\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TradingView<\/a>.
