With sincere apologies to T.S.

What really frosted the regulators' giblets is that when SEC staff \u2014 in the middle of an open investigation \u2014 told the defendants not to spend the money they went ahead and spent $2 million anyway to buy \u201Cprecious metals\u201D. This was a really bad idea, apparently, and led to an immediate lawsuit seeking an asset freeze.","Per the original SEC lawsuit, so-called VERI tokens were plainly unregistered securities and claims about their functionality were plainly horse puckey.","A proposed final judgment, consented to by the defendants, was filed by the SEC on October 31, 2019. The judgment was signed by the Court the next day, on November 1. The judgment contains a permanent injunction against the defendants to not violate securities laws again (I mean you\u2019re already not supposed to), a permanent bar on selling digital securities (a bit more teeth), collection of $9.4 million from the defendants, and establishment of a fund with that money \u201Cso that the victims of Defendants\u2019 fraud may be compensated.\u201D","The order provides that \u201CDefendants are jointly and severally liable for disgorgement of $7,891,600, representing certain profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the Complaint, together with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of$582,535, for a total of $8,474,137. Defendant Middleton is liable for a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000, assessed pursuant to Section 20( d) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. ยง 77t(d)] and Section 2l(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. ยง 78u(d)(3)].\u201D","While this sounds like a really onerous payment obligation, the defendants don\u2019t actually have to pay this if they transfer certain assets, by the terms of the Order. Specifically, both the disgorgement <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">and<\/em> the civil penalty are satisfied if certain assets (including a bunch of precious metals) are transferred to an intermediary chosen by the SEC. As the Order puts it:","On the one hand, Veritaseum and Reggie Middleton are very (sorry) much out of the digital asset business and have to give up all of the remaining money they apparently raised and assets bought with it. On the other hand, Mr. Middleton doesn\u2019t have to write a personal check to the SEC if the referenced assets are transferred. All things considered, this actually doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad deal. Also, while the entire ICO may have been overheated rhetorically and not such a genius idea securities law-wise (I mean, hence the consent order and judgment) it does actually appear that the money was being used to buy a bunch of precious metals and (as far as we can tell from the Order) not a bunch of Lambos. &nbsp;This may be why the whole thing did end as badly as it could have.","","","<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Crypto Caselaw Minute is provided for educational purposes only by Stephen Palley (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson Rosario (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nelsonmrosario\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@nelsonmrosario<\/a>).
