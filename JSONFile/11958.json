That suddenly changed in December as the price of the Solana-based memecoin bonk went parabolic, presenting an arbitrage opportunity given the device came with 30 million of the tokens. The firm\u2019s limited stock of 20,000 phones promptly sold out in the U.S. and EU, with some orders <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268964\/solana-saga-phone-orders-canceled-inventory-issue\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">canceled<\/a> and refunded following inventory issues.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bonk <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/262643\/bonk-bonk-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/11\/bonk.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BONK<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -1.55%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> surged by over 800% last month from $0.0000038 to a peak of $0.000035 on Dec. 15 \u2014 the day the phones sold out.
