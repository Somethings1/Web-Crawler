They did not succeed,\" Garland also said.","He and Wan had been tasking the government worker with stealing confidential information about the case since 2019. In 2021 He paid around $41,000 in bitcoin in return for a document that \"appeared to be classified as 'SECRET,'\" the statement said. Then in October, He paid the government employee an additional $20,000 in bitcoin","He was also charged with two counts of money laundering in relation to the bribe payments and faces up to 60 years in prison if found guilty, while Wang is looking at up to&nbsp;20 years.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Note: This story was updated with additional details.<\/em>"],"hashtag":["CRIME"]}
