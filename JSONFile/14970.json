CoinDesk subsequently verified that the letter was indeed sent.","\u201CHis childhood, early success on Wall Street, embrace of effective altruism and the creation of a crypto empire that catapulted him in record time into the ranks of the richest people in the world seemed more than sufficient for a signature Michael Lewis book,\u201D the letter said. \u201CThe events of the past week have provided a dramatic surprise ending to the story.\u201D","The letter added: \u201CMichael hasn\u2019t written anything yet, but the story has become too big for us to wait.\u201D","A voicemail message left with a senior publicist at Lewis\u2019 publisher, W. W. Norton & Co., wasn\u2019t returned.","There has been speculation for months that Lewis was profiling Bankman-Fried. When asked about that by CoinDesk in September, Bankman-Fried declined to comment.","Lewis is one of the most successful and famous non-fiction writers around. His first book, \u201CLiar\u2019s Poker,\u201D was about his time as a bond trader. \u201CThe Big Short\u201D told the story of investors who successfully bet on the housing market blowing up in 2008, and \u201CFlash Boys\u201D described how computer-driven traders transformed Wall Street and highlighted an effort to fight back.","Lewis often builds his books around scrappy upstarts who challenge the status quo, like baseball executive Billy Beane from \u201CMoneyball,\u201D who helped popularize a more analytical approach to evaluating players, or Brad Katsuyama from \u201CFlash Boys,\u201D whose startup IEX \u2013 which Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX US agreed to invest in this year, creating a connection of sorts to Lewis \u2013 took on Wall Street incumbents like the New York Stock Exchange.","Lewis already said he planned to write a book that would discuss crypto. \u201CI found a character through whom I can write about \u2013 it weirdly links up \u2018Flash Boys,\u2019 \u2018The Big Short\u2019 and \u2018Liar\u2019s Poker,\u2019\u201D he told Financial News in an interview published in August.","\u201CI guess it is possible it will be framed as a crypto book, but it won\u2019t be a crypto book,\u201D Lewis told Financial News. \u201CIt\u2019ll be about this really unusual character. You\u2019ll learn all about crypto and you\u2019ll learn about what screwed up market structure in the United States and so on.\u201D","Lewis interviewed Bankman-Fried on stage in the Bahamas \u2013 where Bankman-Fried ran the business \u2013 at an FTX conference held in April. \u201CThere\u2019s a status upheaval in the financial world, and you\u2019re sitting right in the middle of it,\u201D Lewis said to Bankman-Fried. Lewis was later seen sitting in the audience, writing in his notebook.","Bankman-Fried\u2019s business failed partly because Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of bigger crypto exchange Binance, said he planned to sell his holdings of a token issued by FTX. Chaos ensued, and Binance announced a deal to bail out FTX \u2013 which was withdrawn the next day.","Referring to Bankman-Fried and Zhao, the letter circulating in Hollywood said Lewis \u201Clikens them to the Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader of crypto.\u201D","Read more: Bankman-Fried\u2019s Cabal of Roommates in the Bahamas Ran His Crypto Empire \u2013 and Dated.
