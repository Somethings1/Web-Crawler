It will be incorporated into Polygon\u2019s CDK (software stack), marking an advancement over the project\u2019s previous type 2 proving mechanism, which lacked compatibility with other EVM chains. \u201CThe type-1 prover can generate zero-knowledge proofs for any EVM chain without necessitating hard forks or adjustments to existing clients,\u201D Brendan Farmer, a co-founder of Polygon, told The Block.","Polygon Labs wants to leverage the prover to transition a wide range of blockchains, including side chains and optimistic roll-ups, into validiums \u2014 a specialized form of Layer 2 networks that utilize zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced efficiency and reduced transaction costs.","Validiums store only zk-proofs on the Ethereum mainnet, with actual transaction data held off-chain, supported by a data availability solution. This structure contrasts with ZK-Rollups, which also have to publish proofs of app data on the Ethereum mainnet.","Farmer stressed that projects can also choose to become full-fledged ZK-rollups if they want to make use of their type-1 prover. At the end of the day, it\u2019s up to the teams to make that decision, he clarified.","Moving to a ZK-based network (like validiums or ZK-rollups) can potentially offer advantages to Layer 2 projects, including the elimination of the seven-day withdrawal delay associated with optimistic rollup solutions (e.g., Optimism and Arbitrum).","This delay, Farmer said, has been a point of contention because it incurs additional time and costs for users relying on third-party bridges for transactions.","\u201CIt\u2019s like tens of millions of dollars paid to third-party bridges, and if you look at what it would have cost to prove all of the transactions on those optimistic rollups, it\u2019s like a few hundred thousand dollars,\u201D Farmer added. \u201CUsers are being forced to bear a lot of costs on Optimistic Layer 2s that are just unnecessary, and an upgrade to a ZK-based network just fixes this.\u201D","Following the ZK transition, chains can be connected through Polygon\u2019s interoperability protocol \u2014 the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/274296\/polygon-agglayer-blockchain?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AggLayer<\/a> \u2014 which promises interoperability and unified liquidity for Layer 2s.
