They will update Dorsey, who also oversees the sprawling FTX bankruptcy case, on their progress at an April 12 hearing.","Bankman-Fried is facing a litany of criminal charges over his alleged wrongdoing at FTX and could spend the rest of his life in jail if he is convicted. The former FTX CEO has argued that he needs the Robinhood shares to fund his legal defense.","During the hearing, BlockFi agreed to withdraw its motion to dismiss the Emergent Fidelity Technologies bankruptcy case. The defunct crypto lender had also filed a motion challenging FTX\u2019s standing to object to its motion to dismiss the Emergent bankruptcy case, which the judge dismissed.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.<\/em>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","© 2023 The Block.
