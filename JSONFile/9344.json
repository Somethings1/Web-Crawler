But a spokesperson for Ramp said yesterday that a larger sum had been sought from an early stage in negotiations. The company did not disclose a valuation in its announcement.","Existing backers NFX, Galaxy Digital, Seedcamp, Firstminute Capital and angel investors such as Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus and TrueLayer\u2019s Francesco Simoneschi also participated. Balderton general partner Rana Yared has joined Ramp\u2019s board.","Founded in 2017, Ramp offers a non-custodial payment infrastructure that helps exchanges, marketplaces and wallets to offer smoother paths to buying crypto and other digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It styles itself as the \u2018PayPal for crypto.\u2019","Yared said in a statement that the Ramp team is \u201Cproviding a reliable way in for new audiences by making buying digital assets as straightforward as buying US dollars when making a purchase from your favourite American brand in Euros.\u201D","The Series A close comes barely six months after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/108306\/galaxy-digital-nfx-9-million-raise-poland-ramp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ramp\u2019s $9 million seed raise<\/a> in June. The company said it has seen monthly transaction volumes grow by a factor of 30 times in the past 12 months, while tripling the size of its team.","The latest influx of cash will be used to continue hiring and to drive new partnership deals.","Szymon Sypniewicz, Ramp\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said the company is targeting partnerships in three key areas: mass-market consumer tech firms like Mozilla and Opera; NFT and gaming platforms like Sorare and Axie Infinity; and crypto platforms.","\u201CMore broadly, the market opportunity for us is really with the advent of web3 \u2014 and we\u2019re looking at partnerships, products and collaborations that will play a role in the mainstream adoption of decentralized applications,\u201D he added.","The company is already partnered with more than 400 developers including well-known names like Mozilla, Dapper Labs, Aave and Sorare. It was added to the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s anti-money laundering register in July, and more recently has been handed approval from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to offer services in the United States.","Â© 2023 The Block.
