Hunting Hill cites the interest of institutional investors for the move, and the future potential of moves made during a downward cycle","\u201CWe are contrarian traders by nature and we look for these types of distressed dislocations and believe that there is opportunity when those occur,\u201D Adam Guren, co-founder of HHD and chief investment officer of Hunting Hill, said during an interview with CoinDesk. \u201CThese are the times that we want to be putting seeds in the ground to watch them in the future.\u201D","HDD will eventually manage all of Hunting Hill\u2019s digital asset products once that transition is completed, including the Hunting Hill Crypto Opportunities Fund. The affiliate plans to explore tokenization and non-fungible token (NFT) asset management, and will be managed by Guren and co-founder Sonny Dozier.","Established in 2012 as an asset manager targeting institutional investors, Hunting Hill moved into digital assets in 2016. By 2021, the firm had about $3.5 billion of its balance sheet dedicated to trading of digital assets and their derivatives. Hunting Hill started to reduce that exposure due to red flags about counterparty risks in the industry, said Guren, which meant the firm didn\u2019t have exposure to the bankruptcies and insolvencies that rocked the industries.","The existence of Hunting Hill Digital was first reported by Blockworks last December. The new affiliate experienced some early controversy when CNBC reported that three former executives of Genesis \u2013 the crypto lender and CoinDesk sister company that filed for bankruptcy earlier this year \u2013 were claiming to be HDD co-founders and touted a Bessemer Ventures investment, which the investor denied.","Hunting Hill later told The Daily Beast that the firm had discussions with two of the ex-Genesis employees, but they had never started employment. The third, Martin Garcia, was HDD\u2019s chief investment officer before his departure on May 1, a source told CoinDesk.","Edited by Aoyon Ashraf."],"entity":[{"type":"May 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Guren","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2012","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$364 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BaseLayer Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bessemer Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"The Daily Beast","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aoyon Ashraf","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Martin Garcia","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$20 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Adam Guren","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$25 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Sonny Dozier","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Exclusive","TradFi","Hedge Fund"],"authors":["Brandy Betz"]}
