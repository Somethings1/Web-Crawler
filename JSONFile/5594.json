An ETF would be like a perfect marriage between crypto and regulation, easing worries for institutional investors who've been looking for a legitimate way to build a crypto portfolio.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chong Kok Kee, CEO of AsiaNext, an institution-only crypto exchange, explained that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chainalysis.com\/blog\/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto adoption in Asia<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is higher than other continents, with Central and South Asia being the top regions. \u201CThe Asian market, known for its preference for stable investments, might see a mindset shift in viewing crypto as an investment asset besides its transactional purpose, as the ETF provides a regulated and lower-risk avenue for investment exposure to cryptocurrencies,\u201D Chong said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Following the U.S. ETF approval, which Coinbase dubbed a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/271778\/coinbase-calls-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-watershed-moment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201Cwatershed moment\u201D<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> for crypto, Asian jurisdictions may next push out such spot crypto products.<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268582\/industry-leaders-see-hong-kong-as-next-bitcoin-etf-hub-amid-us-approval-anticipation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hong Kong<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, which underwent a major regulatory renewal last year to reclaim its position as the region\u2019s crypto hub, could be next to introduce a spot crypto ETF in Asia, several regional experts suggested.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIn Asia, Hong Kong is definitely the prime candidate for the next spot crypto ETF. Aligning with its crypto hub ambitions, Hong Kong regulators have already sent a clear message that there is an appetite to consider spot crypto ETFs, including for retail,\u201D Angela Ang, a former Monetary Authority of Singapore regulator and senior policy advisor at blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, told The Block. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe next step is aligning regulatory and industry expectations on controls and compliance, in order to make this a reality,\u201D Ang added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It appears that Hong Kong, a financial hub and a regulatory testbed for China, is already on the move.
