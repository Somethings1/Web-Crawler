Now, two people familiar with the matter told The Block that MoonPay did give at least some of the celebrities Bored Ape NFTs without expecting payment.<\/span>","MoonPay denies giving celebrities Bored Apes free of charge. A MoonPay spokesperson said the crypto firm charged its celebrity clients \u201Cin full for the price of the NFTs\u201D and that customers pay for the service. Pressed on exactly when invoices were sent and whether all MoonPay's clients paid their bills, another spokesperson declined to comment further.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The list of celebrities who boasted after scoring Bored Apes through MoonPay is as long as it is illustrious and includes pop stars Justin Bieber and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/139238\/madonna-becomes-the-latest-celeb-to-flaunt-a-new-bored-ape\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Madonna<\/a>, late-night host Jimmy Fallon, Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow and celebrity debutante Paris Hilton.
