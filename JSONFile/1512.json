Sall previously worked as Coinbase\u2019s head of product analytics and West was a senior backend engineer for the crypto exchange. The two departed Coinbase last summer to begin building out Goldfinch.","At the heart of Goldfinch\u2019s design is the concept of no-collateral loans. The argument is that a lending system based on collateralization favors those who possess such resources while locking out those who don\u2019t have funds to begin with. \u201CDeFi has a massive opportunity to transform access to capital, but it will only be possible once it can make loans without collateral. That\u2019s what will finally open crypto lending to most people in the world,\u201D the two wrote in a blog post published Tuesday.","The protocol has been running on Ethereum\u2019s mainnet since December, with Goldfinch serving as its first loan underwriter. To date, Goldfinch has underwritten $1 million in loans to about 10,000 end-borrowers, with a focus on emerging markets, according to Sall and West.","Thus far, Goldfinch says it has clinched deals with three companies: Aspire, a small-business finance startup backed by a MassMutual venture arm; PayJoy, a Mexico-based company that finances smartphones; and QuickCheck, a Nigeria-based startup that provides personal loans.","Goldfinch\u2019s protocol is currently built around the USDC stablecoin. At its center is a USDC liquidity pool, which lenders \u2014 such as those mentioned above \u2014 can draw from. The USDC is then exchanged for local currencies and lent out to borrowers. The lenders repay the pool in the form of USDC, which is put in the pool by way of liquidity providers who earn a yield on their deposits. \u201CAs the lending businesses make their interest payments back to the protocol, they\u2019re immediately disbursed to all investors,\u201D West and Sall explain in their post.","Over time, the goal is for Goldfinch to serve as a basis for a decentralized underwriting system, which in itself will provide a means for earning yield from the protocol. \u201CThis will allow the protocol to scale the underwriting process and onboard new lending businesses entirely through the community, the team wrote.","The project\u2019s emergence comes as the DeFi lending space continues to grow.
