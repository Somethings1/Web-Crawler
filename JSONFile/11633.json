Introduced at the end of March, the bill calls on the Treasury to put out digital hardware that offers a user experience that\u2019s as much like cash as possible. In practice, this would mean full privacy, and woudl bar a ledger of any kind.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lynch presides over the Task Force on Financial Technology, a sub-group of the House Financial Services Committee that hosted the hearing. He considers it a good sign for the bill\u2019s fate that the chair of the full committee, Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA), scheduled such a hearing so soon after its introduction.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s getting some interest from unexpected quarters,\u201D Lynch said of the bill in an interview with The Block. \u201CThere\u2019s something about the total surveillance aspect of everything else that just rubs me the wrong way, in terms of having to surrender your data for every transaction, or establishing an account.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Even so, Warren Davidson (R-OH), the ranking member on the task force, said he was still studying the proposal and had not come out for or against.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CA lot of the problem that they\u2019re trying to solve on the Democratic side of the aisle is how do we get funds to the unbanked in a quick way,\u201D Davidson told The Block. \u201CI\u201Dm not sure that his idea makes it easier to do that, because you still have to get this piece of hardware to someone and if you can get this hardware to them why can\u2019t you actually get the cash to them?\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bill Foster (D-IL), who sits on the Financial Services Committee and may well be the only member of Congress who has actually written the code to a blockchain, was likewise non-committal on the proposal.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI have to understand the technology that actually makes that work. Offline transactions are very tough,\u201D Foster told The Block. \u201CTrying to deal with the double-spend problem requires trusted hardware rather than trusted collaboration on the internet so it\u2019s a very different set of security challenges. Things like that, I would guess, would work well for transactions of limited value.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lynch noted that the current bill leaves technological specifics open to pilot programs with the Treasury.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alongside Lynch\u2019s proposal, the hearing focused on a range of players offering payments, including Google, Apple, Paypal, Block, Zelle and digital asset wallets, with stablecoins receiving particular note.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Raúl Carillo, a fellow at Yale who helped draft the ECASH Act, noted inadequate consumer protections for current digital payments, particularly the fact that digital wallets generally hold pass-through, rather than FDIC, insurance. He said in his testimony:&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis is not a direct relationship between a consumer and a bank. It does not protect against a failure of the wallet provider or the coin issuer, it just protects against a bank failure.
