Five of the stolen items were Bored Ape, Mutant Ape or Bored Ape Kennel Club NFTs, and nine high profile individuals have reported falling victim to the attack.&nbsp;<\/span>","Earlier this month, BAYC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/138156\/apecoin-tied-to-bored-ape-nft-ecosystem-debuts-with-planned-community-airdrop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched an airdrop<\/a> of ApeCoin tokens for Bored and Mutant Ape NFT holders. For this attack, scammers <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hacked multiple verified Twitter accounts in order to promote links to a URL impersonating an ApeCoin token airdrop site. Some of the Twitter accounts had more than 50,000 followers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Unsuspecting victims who clicked on the phishing links included both BAYC NFT owners and non-holders willing to cough up 0.33 ETH ($1,130) to take part. However, instead of registering for the chance to claim ApeCoin tokens in a new airdrop, they found themselves faced with malicious code that gave the scammers access to their wallet.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe tweet looked strange, but this is someone that I had actually followed [previously] so I didn\u2019t overthink it... I clicked the link in the tweet and was immediately prompted to connect my wallet, which I did not do,\u201D explained Aaron Cadena, co-founder of NFT-themed vaping company Gutter Bars, in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aarontcadena\/status\/1505951034404794373\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweet thread<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> detailing how his #2017 and #2904 Gutter Cats were taken.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAfter clicking cancel, the prompt kept popping up over and over again. I clicked cancel a few more times, then caught onto what was happening and tried leaving the site but my screen was locked.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cadena describes how, despite force quitting the browser, he received a notification that two assets had been transferred from his wallet.<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt felt like a punch in the gut.
