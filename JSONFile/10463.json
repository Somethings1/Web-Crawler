But the Fed governor cast doubt on a foreign CBDC supplanting the U.S. dollar\u2019s global reserve currency status, an argument put forward in support of a digital dollar.","Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Lael Brainard have also begun publicly putting brakes on the possibility of a U.S. CBDC happening <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/173111\/the-fed-has-not-decided-to-proceed-with-a-digital-dollar-says-powell\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">anytime soon<\/a>.&nbsp;","Even if a foreign CBDC takes off, Waller said, the effects of companies using it, \u201Cwill likely only be on the margin because they rely on a large enough number of individuals and businesses being nearly indifferent between the dollar and the foreign currency in CBDC form.\u201D","Waller sees privately-issued stablecoins strengthening, rather than weakening, the dollar, since so many are pegged to the world\u2019s dominant fiat currency. The Fed governor argued that \u201Cthey may increase rather than reduce the primacy of the dollar abroad, since demand for stablecoins increases demand for dollar-denominated reserve assets held by the stablecoin issuer.\u201D","The new payments technology must also be, \u201Crisk-managed and subject to a robust supervisory and regulatory framework,\u201D said Waller, echoing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174527\/senior-u-s-regulators-propose-new-legislation-increased-rules-around-digital-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">similar<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/176025\/g20-central-bankers-warn-stablecoins-arent-stable-recommend-action-around-crypto-assets?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">warnings<\/a> from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the American super committee of financial regulators, and the Financial Stability Board, an international advisory consortium for central bankers and other senior officials.","Negotiations continue over stablecoins legislation in Congress, though the lead Republican negotiator, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., told The Block earlier this week that the Biden administration is <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/3EhW2uf32f\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">holding up progress<\/a> on the bill.","Â© 2023 The Block.
