Furthermore, ultrasound.money claims $1.2 billion is being removed from the ether supply over the same time frame.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The supply of ether has declined by 0.144% yearly since The Merge. Source: ultrasound.money<\/span>","The current supply of ether is roughly 120,418,032 million coins.","Though The Merge has undoubtedly catalyzed Ethereum's reduction in native-coin supply, it did not itself implement the burning of ether. Instead, that tokenomic aspect was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/125383\/more-than-1-million-eth-has-been-burned-following-eip-1559\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">triggered<\/a> by Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 \u2014 or EIP-1559, for short \u2014 which was pushed via the London upgrade.","Last August \u2014 or&nbsp;623 days ago, to be precise \u2014 Ethereum's London upgrade effectively split <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/114474\/how-do-ethereum-transaction-fees-work-now-that-eip-1559-is-live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">transaction fees<\/a> into a base cost and a priority fee. The former is burned, while the latter served as a form of payment to miners \u2014 which no longer exist for the protocol.","EIP-1559 was also designed to exert deflationary pressure on the ether supply since the base fee gets burned and can no longer be used on the network \u2014 reducing the amount of inflation on the Ethereum network. But it,&nbsp;itself, hasn't decreased the blockchain's total supply. Since London went live, the total supply of ether has increased by 3.21 million coins.","On the subject of burning ether, that activity has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227057\/ethereum-shapella-first-week-deposits-withdrawals-burn\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">increased<\/a> since Ethereum's Shapella upgrade opened up staked ether withdrawals just over one week ago.","Â© 2023 The Block.
