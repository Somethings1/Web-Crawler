The term was coined by blockchain platform Polkadot \u2014 and its canary network Kusama \u2014 and refers to a blockchain that\u2019s used for trialing protocols out before they go live on the main network.","There is a difference between testnets \u2014 which are similarly used for testing \u2014 and canary networks like Kusama and Sagan. Testnet tokens typically don\u2019t carry any value, so they recreate the technical side of the main blockchain but not its real environment. On the other hand, tokens on canary networks do have real value, so they come much closer to mimicking the real environment. That creates greater incentives for people to find bugs and potential exploits.","Earlier in the keynote, Tendermint (which builds Cosmos) and the Interchain Foundation also announced a partnership with gaming company Forte \u2014 which will entail an undisclosed investment in the company, according to the source \u2014 and announced that its DeFi platform Emeris will launch in December. Emeris will include cross-chain farming and cross-chain staking within the Cosmos ecosystem.","<i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For more breaking stories like this, make sure to follow The Block on&nbsp;<\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a><\/i><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/i>"],"hashtag":["COSMOS"]}
