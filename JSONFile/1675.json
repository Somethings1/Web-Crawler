He added that while Henyep Group incubated Q9 Capital in-house, the long-term plan is to spin it off into a separate entity.","James Quinn, managing director of Q9 Capital and previously the head of markets at Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic, said since Q9's soft launch in Q4, it has seen an uptick of interest from non-crypto native investors.&nbsp;","\"Around 90% of our clients are either completely new to crypto or did one or two investments previously but haven't been actively involved in the space \u2013 generally the Bitcoin Class 2021,\" Quinn said in an interview.","\"We have seen a definite uptick [for bitcoin] with a theme around the narrative of hedging for inflation and de-globalization,\" he said. \"That, combined with the price action, have generated interest for our client set who have bought crypto for the first time.\"","In terms of the crypto knowledge among non-native investors, Quinn said it has changed from a few years ago when it was \"really about convincing clients whether crypto is interesting at all.\"","\"I think the narrative right now is they have done some research and are pretty convinced they want to do something in the space but asking questions about platforms, services, security measures,\" Quinn said.","According to him, the average trade tickets from Q9's clients right now are \"over a couple of hundred thousand dollars\" after they allocate a relatively smaller amount as initial test trades.","\"It's definitely much bigger than retail and is exactly hitting the target market we are expecting, which is anywhere from young professionals and mass affluent all the way up to the ultra-high-net-worth,\" he said."],"hashtag":["BITCOIN"]}
