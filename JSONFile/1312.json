And it won\u2019t be in the U.S.","His new initiative, called <a href=\"https:\/\/civkit.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Civ Kit<\/a>, is a \u201Cblueprint for developers and entrepreneurs to build their own censorship-resistant and permissionless global marketplace.\u201D","It\u2019s what Youssef calls an \u201Cunstoppable marketplace\u201D that will allow anyone, anywhere, to trade using the Lightning Network and Nostr, a protocol that enables decentralized social media.","\u201CWe want everyone to be trading with everyone. We want someone in Venezuela trading with someone in Russia,\u201D Youssef said on a recent podcast with The Block\u2019s Frank Chaparro. \u201CNo barriers, no permission required.","The endeavor comes on the heels of the implosion of Paxful, which he founded in 2015 with Artur Shaback, who is now suing Youssef. In the face of legal uncertainty in the U.S. \u2014 though nothing imminent \u2014 Paxful had decided in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194274\/ceo-paxful-tells-customers-get-bitcoin-off-platform\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">November to dissolve the company<\/a> \u2014 a \u201Cnice, tidy dissolving,\u201D Youssef said.","\u201CWe spent all the money on compliance to make sure that any frozen funds were released back to the users and then there wouldn't be any creditors,\u201D Youssef said. Shaback, however, \u201Cdecided to sue me because he wouldn't get his nine-figure payday if the company dissolved. So it was purely out of greed.\u201D","Shaback said the two \u201Chad differences in the business direction and governance of Paxful,\u201D and that Youssef migrated Paxful\u2019s IP, userbase, wallet history and passwords to a new venture, Noones.com.","\u201CHe could not take me with him due to me being a U.S. resident,\u201D Shaback said in an email to The Block, adding that he may not continue pursuing the lawsuit as it takes time and resources and may instead seek a settlement.","\u201C\u201DPaxful was able and is able to function and serve billions of people worldwide and that is my goal now to restore it,\u201D Shaback said.","Instead of \"Know-Your-Customer,\" Civ Kit will use \u201Cknow-your-peer (KYP) oracles.\"","\u201CKYC is horrible,\u201D Youssef said. \u201CPeople want to know who they're trading with, especially for big transactions.
