The token will be issued on the Liquid Network, a Bitcoin sidechain, under the ticker HILSV, and traded against U.S. dollars and Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin.&nbsp;","\u201CThe HILSV token marks the first digital asset tokenization from El Salvador and represents an important step forward in developing its nascent capital market as well as introducing a major new asset class into the market,\u201D Bitfinex Securities CTO Paolo Ardoinio said in a statement shared with The Block.","\u201CFor the first time, investors who do not usually have the opportunity to invest in such assets have the opportunity to do so, while issuers in markets which have less access to capital are able to tap into a new asset class to raise finance,\u201D Ardoinio added.","The issuance aims to raise $6.25 million, offering a 10% coupon over a five-year term \u2014 meaning buyers receive an annual interest payment equal to 10% of their investment over five years, after which the principal is returned. The capital raise will commence on May 13, with a minimum investment of $1,000.","The initiative also hopes to generate 1,000 jobs during the construction phase and up to 5,000 jobs related to the complex during its operation.","\u201CThe recently implemented digital asset laws will grant us access to capital markets previously unavailable to us,\u201D Inversiones Laguardia President Roberto Laguardia said. \u201CThis access will allow us to develop crucial tourism-related infrastructure, thereby unlocking the potential for growth in the tourism sector.\u201D","HILSV follows a tokenized bond offering by Alternative via Bitfinex Securities AIFC in Kazakhstan in November. Bitfinex Securities announced that this first tokenized bond on the Liquid Network raised over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268562\/bitfinex-securities-announces-first-tokenized-bond-on-liquid-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$5.2 million<\/a> in USDT. Customers seeking to access all Bitfinex Securities issuances must be verified with both its Kazakhstan and El Salvador entities.","El Salvador hit the headlines in 2021 by giving <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/107699\/el-salvador-becomes-the-first-country-ever-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin legal tender<\/a> status.
