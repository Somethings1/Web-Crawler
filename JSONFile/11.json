This phenomenon will halve the reward for mining a Bitcoin block from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoins, putting pressure on miners\u2019 profitability. <\/strong>","Miners are now in a race against time, requiring higher Bitcoin prices to maintain their earnings.","According to a CryptoQuant\u2019s report shared with BeInCrypto, miner hashprice have dipped 30% since the last halving in May 2020. Currently valued at $0.11 per Terahash per second, this figure is poised to drop to $0.055 after <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/bitcoin-halving-countdown\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the halving<\/a>, assuming stable market conditions.","\u201CThe hashprice is the average revenue a miner gets each time it tries to find a valid Bitcoin block,\u201D CryptoQuant explained.","Furthermore, <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/bitcoin-miners-mint-transaction-fess-ordinals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin transaction fees<\/a> have seen a dramatic decrease. They plummeted from 412 Bitcoin per day in mid-December 2023 to just 29 Bitcoin, marking a 90% reduction. Currently, transaction fees contribute just 3% to the total block reward, significantly down from 37% in mid-December 2023.","<strong>Read more: <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/learn\/bitcoin-halving-promotions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">7 Best Bitcoin Halving Promotions to Check Out in 2024<\/a><\/strong>","Moreover, the competition among miners has reached unprecedented levels. The <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/bitcoin-miners-selling-pressure-hash-rate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin network hashrate<\/a>, indicating the total computational power, has soared to approximately 600 exahashes per second (EH\/s), up from 116 EH\/s since the last halving. ","This surge means miners must exert significantly more effort and resources to mine the same amount of Bitcoin, with the cost of mining, or hashcoin, increasing tenfold since May 2020.","In response to these challenges, some <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/bitcoin-price-drop-miners-sell-btc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">miners have escalated their Bitcoin selling<\/a> activities. For example, daily sales to over-the-counter (OTC) desks hit 1,600 Bitcoin in late March, the highest since August 2023. Simultaneously, the <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/bitcoin-miner-reserves-continue-decline-btc-drops-3-week-low\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin reserves held by miners have been on a consistent downward<\/a> trajectory over the last year.","Significant selling from Bitcoin miners can indeed put pressure on <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/bitcoin-btc-breaks-key-resistance-85000-next\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitcoin\u2019s price<\/a>.","Despite these difficulties, not all mining companies are struggling.

He argues that the mining industry doesn\u2019t need special preparation for the halving, as market forces will eventually stabilize the situation.","\u201CThe miners are getting less Bitcoin for a similar amount of mining that they are doing, but the price should reflect that, or the hash rate can level itself out, almost becoming the perfect market. Any discrepancy can be rebalanced. It\u2019s similar to gold, so I don\u2019t think you need to prepare for it more than anything else,\u201D Ahmed told BeInCrypto.","Past halving events support Ahmed\u2019s view. The total daily revenue of the Bitcoin mining industry has hit new highs in 2024, with a record $79 million on March 6 and $67 million currently. This is 3.5 times higher than the revenue just before the May 2020 halving. ","These figures suggest that despite the immediate challenges, the industry may find a new equilibrium after the halving.","Disclaimer","In line with the <a href=\"https:\/\/beincrypto.com\/trust-project\/\">Trust Project<\/a> guidelines, this price analysis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.
