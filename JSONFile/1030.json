Initially designed to maintain its peg to the US dollar algorithmically, albeit with some backing, USDD&nbsp;will now be overcollateralized, according to TRON founder Justin Sun.","A reserve comprised of cryptocurrencies and other stablecoins has been amassed and will be maintained at a minimum of 130% of the total amount of USDD in issuance, he said. In a news release, TRON described that collateral ratio as \u201Cguaranteed,\u201D and said that it would begin publishing real-time updates on the collateral ratio on <a href=\"https:\/\/tdr.org\/#\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TRON DAO Reserve\u2019s website<\/a> from June 5.&nbsp;","As things stand, according to a TRON spokesperson, the reserve contains 10,500 bitcoin (around $330 million), 240 million USDT, and 1.9 billion TRX, as well as 8.29 billion TRX in a burning contract.&nbsp;","\u201CWe want to upgrade USDD to a hybrid model,\u201D said Sun. \u201CSo on the one side we have an algorithmic stablecoin \u2014 an algorithm to make the stablecoin stable \u2014 on the other hand we have TRON DAO Reserve.\u201D","USDD was designed to incentivize arbitrageurs to keep its price pegged to that of the US dollar through trading between TRX, TRON\u2019s token, and USDD \u2014 following the algorithmic stability blueprint. Like Terra, TRON had also signaled its intent to establish a reserve of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to support USDD in extreme market conditions.","Still, that combination of safeguards proved spectacularly ineffective for Terra\u2019s UST. The stablecoin, which was the third largest by issuance prior to its collapse, veered sharply away from its dollar peg in mid-May, taking down Terra\u2019s LUNA with it and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiuu_3Fm5D4AhXWxDgGHU5wCe0QFnoECAgQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2Fd459f435-edff-412c-85a5-0961d50aba69&amp;usg=AOvVaw2WzM8FthrYfYVm5ZJo-UiD\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wiping out some $40 billion in value<\/a> in a matter of days.&nbsp;Billions of dollars in bitcoin were sold and unprecedented volumes of Terra\u2019s native token LUNA issued in a frantic attempt to restore the peg, but to no avail.","Sun, however, contends that hope remains for USDD \u2014 which has already reached $667 million in total circulating supply \u2014 if it can be suitably backstopped.","\u201CThe reserve backing we\u2019re using right now is highly diversified. It includes bitcoin and all different kinds of stablecoin. USDC [Circle\u2019s stablecoin] will be a part of our reserve, but it will only be a small part of our reserve,\u201D he said.&nbsp;","In its news release, TRON provided a full list of the assets in the reserve, which are bitcoin, TRX, USDC, USDT, TUSD and USDJ.&nbsp;","\u201CAll the Bitcoin addresses will be signed by signature so everybody will know those bitcoins belong to us,\u201D Sun added.","In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/144858\/very-stable-geniuses-the-race-to-build-regulation-proof-stablecoins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a previous interview<\/a>, Sun told The Block that building so-called \"decentralized\" stablecoins that cannot be interfered with by regulators is a pressing need for the crypto industry. &nbsp;","Asked whether he was tempted to simply abandon the USDD project in the aftermath of UST\u2019s collapse, Sun said the Luna Foundation Guard \u2014 a Singapore-based non-profit that had raised billions of dollars in cryptocurrency to buttress UST \u2014 mismanaged the situation by trying to sell to panicked investors.","\u201CWe need to be one step before the market,\u201D he said. \u201CWe want to basically participate in a role to stabilize the market \u2014 to decrease the volatility in the first place.\u201D","Currently, the bulk of the reserve has been financed by TRON directly, but the company hopes to add external capital from investors soon, according to Sun.&nbsp;","Prior to its demise, holders of UST were able to park the stablecoin in Terra\u2019s lending platform Anchor Protocol to earn interest rates of 20%, which many had flagged as unsustainable. TRON has a similar platform named JustLend. Currently, it offers annual interest rates of 17.67%, but Sun said he hopes to drive that higher \u2014 to \u201Caround 30%.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Correction: story updated to adjust TRON's holdings of bitcoin and USDT as outlined in the fourth paragraph.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
