This bitcoin sat unmoved until the weekend when it was split up and sent to the new addresses. This left just 1.4 bitcoin ($99,000) in the wallet.","The funds were initially split into two amounts in two different wallets. Then, one amount was moved to a new wallet, and the other amount was split again and moved into two more wallets. As a result, the funds are now in three wallets, with one containing $5 billion of bitcoin and the rest roughly divided between the other two.","Most large Bitcoin addresses are associated with exchanges. However, this wallet has very few interactions and no signs that it is linked to an exchange.","\"That\u2019s a long time to not reconfigure\/move around your customer\u2019s cold storage\u2026 most of the time there's some indication of exchange-related activity,\" said Arkham CEO Miguel Morel.","This is the first notable Bitcoin wallet movement in a while. In January, someone sent 26.9 bitcoin (worth $1.2 million at the time) seemingly from Binance to the Bitcoin network\u2019s Genesis wallet \u2014 which they won't be able to get back.
