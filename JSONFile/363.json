Fraxlend allows the Frax Finance protocol to directly lend FRAX and earn interest through existing money markets.","Until now, the only way to do that was by taking out an over-collateralized loan on a lending platform such as Curve. With Fraxlend, the protocol can now do this whole process in-house, which generates an additional cash flow that can be used to \u201Cbuy back and burn FXS (similar to how MakerDAO burns MKR from stability fees),\u201D according to Frax Finance's <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.frax.finance\/amo\/frax-lending\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">website.<\/a>","The second new application Drake highlighted is the ability to create custom term sheets for protocol-to-protocol deals. Typically, these deals \u2014 such as when a DAO wants to send another DAO tokens&nbsp; \u2014 are worked out via Telegram chats and finalized as OTC deals involving multi-sig wallets. Fraxlend lets DAOs set up the deal on chain, automating the process and making it more transparent.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\"Fraxlend is one of the newest generations of lending protocols that will showcase new innovations in onchain debt origination,\u201D said Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian. \u201CSome of these features have never been built before in any kind of lending system so we are extremely excited to finally bring these use cases to DeFi.\""],"hashtag":["LENDING"]}
