Belshe <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChrisBlec\/status\/1603115472685342720\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> that someone from Alameda contacted BitGo about unwrapping 3,000 WBTC ($50 million) to get back bitcoin days before the Nov. 11 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186132\/ftx-collapse-timeline-six-days-that-rocked-the-crypto-industry\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bankruptcy filing<\/a>. He noted that the redemption request was unusual because it came from an Alameda representative that BitGo had not dealt with previously.","The BitGo custodian knows all operative personnel of each firm that owns WBTC, according to Belshe. He also said that the Alameda representative did not pass its security verification process and was not familiar with WBTC burns \u2014 the process in which wrapped bitcoin is redeemed for BTC by sending it to the burn address, which then triggers the release of the bitcoin that was used to mint it.","\u201CSo, we [Bitgo] held it up and said this is not what a burn looks like and we need to know who this person was,\u201D Belshe said. \u201CWhile we were holding it, waiting for a response on those issues, they [Alameda] went bankrupt and of course, once they went bankrupt, everything halted.\u201D","Screenshot showing the attempt by Alameda to redeem 3,000 WBTC is still pending. Image: WBTC dashboard","Alameda attempted to unwind the 3,000 WBTC anyway, and on-chain data from Etherscan <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0x50078c408a8b3637ed02ccd4be49857a442e8f9416dc0b0e52749ea97e65e089\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shows<\/a> 3,000 WBTC were sent from an Alameda wallet to the WBTC controller contract on Nov. 9. The tokens were sent to the burn address and so have effectively been destroyed.","Under normal circumstances, that would have triggered a redemption of 3,000 BTC from BitGo to Alameda\u2019s coffers, but BitGo has to approve any redemption requests before any bitcoin is released. The WBTC <a href=\"https:\/\/wbtc.network\/dashboard\/order-book\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dashboard<\/a> still shows this particular redemption attempt as pending, and WBTC is thus presently overcollateralized by 3,000 BTC. The WBTC dashboard currently shows that BitGo holds 202,255 BTC in custody against 199,238 WBTC in circulation.","Belshe hailed BitGo\u2019s handling of the matter as indicative of the company\u2019s robust security apparatus. The BitGo chief said, however, that the redemption attempt could have been legitimate but did not meet established protocols. Belshe said the company will not do anything with the 3,000 BTC that corresponds to the WBTC in question, adding that he expects the tokens will be dealt with by the trustees handling the Alameda bankruptcy proceedings.","BitGo did not immediately respond to The Block's request for additional comment.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
