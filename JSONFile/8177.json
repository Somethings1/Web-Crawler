Increasingly, as comprehensive federal crypto legislation continues to prove elusive, states are stepping into the void,\u201D said Alex Grieve, a vice president at the Washington, D.C. government affairs firm Tiger Hill Partners, via text. \u201CThe result is a mixed bag: some are overly antagonistic (as this has become politically popular in some instances); some are generally supportive of crypto and entrepreneurs building innovative companies in it.\u201D","Lawmakers in Congress have introduced a laundry list of their own crypto regulation bills, but it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230304\/consensus-building-congress-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">not yet clear<\/a> which bills might actually pass \u2014 or when.","In the meantime, states are working to write new laws after the crypto industry chaos of 2022, said Aaron Kaplan, the founder and co-CEO of Prometheum, a company that is creating market for compliant security tokens overseen and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CStates are taking actions to try to protect their constituents, the investors who live there, the average people,\u201D Kaplan said. \u201CInstead of a democratization of finance \u2026 You saw a democratization of the scam. They were able to use the internet and the catchy branding and FOMO to basically get the retail public, as many people as they could, to participate. And as a result, when everything turned upside down those are the people who were most injured. And those are the people who the those legislators in those states represent. So there's obviously going to be a reaction.\u201D","Here are six state-level crypto bills to watch.","New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, unveiled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229690\/new-york-crypto-bill\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">legislation<\/span><\/a> last week that could force crypto firms to repay customers who are victims of fraud the same way that banks do.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CFor too long, fraud in the cryptocurrency industry has caused investors to lose hundreds of billions, with low-income investors and people of color suffering the most,\u201D James <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NewYorkStateAG\/status\/1654482730313216005\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said on Twitter<\/span><\/a>.","The bill would also \u201Cprevent people who create crypto assets from also owning crypto platforms,\u201D James said, and stop crypto firms from borrowing or lending investor assets.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential presidential candidate, promoted the legislation earlier this year. The bill would update the state commercial code to ban CBDCs.","\"Florida rejects the idea of a central bank digital currency,\" DeSantis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229539\/they-want-to-get-rid-of-crypto-florida-governor-ron-desantis-warns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said at a recent press conference<\/span><\/a>. \"You could just get fined, and they'll just take it right out of your digital currency, without any due process or anything like that.
