We have a range of career opportunities that we are looking to fill and our hiring plans remain intact,\" Claudia Lagorio, chief operating officer at Bitfinex, told The Block when contacted about the company's personnel plans.","Lagorio went on to say that Bitfinex has \"never hired aggressively and then reduced staff during a crypto winter.\" She added that the crypto exchange operator is profitable and we will continue to hire talent as needed.","Bitfinex's rivals have recently cut jobs amid crashing crypto markets, including Coinbase, Gemini, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/153040\/crypto-exchange-bybit-layoffs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bybit<\/a>, BitMEX and Crypto.com.
