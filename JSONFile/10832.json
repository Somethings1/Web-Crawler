Optimism formally announced the launch of its token at the end of April and released it the following month.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/scaling-solutions\/optimistic-rollups\/transaction-count-daily-7dma\/embed\" title=\"Transaction Count on Optimistic Rollups (Daily, 7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Optimism\u2019s transaction count began rising leading up to the governance token <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/143635\/ethereum-scaling-startup-optimism-confirms-governance-token-as-part-of-broader-shift\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announcement<\/a>. The protocol then saw a surge when the token formally went live across exchanges on May 31. This led to interest and speculation for a potential Arbitrum token launch.","Since then, both platforms have seen a steady rise in transactions and have continued an upward trajectory.","Arbitrum currently has the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) across all Layer 2 networks, with roughly 50% market share. Optimism has a market share of approximately 30%, <a href=\"https:\/\/l2beat.com\/scaling\/tvl\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to L2Beat.<\/a>","By contrast, the next closest Layer 2 by market share is Metis, which has a <a href=\"https:\/\/l2beat.com\/scaling\/tvl\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2.71% market share.<\/a> Metis announced a 26-week-long<a href=\"https:\/\/metisdao.medium.com\/metisdao-foundation-announces-metis-marathon-builder-incentive-program-94b424e5553b\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> incentive program<\/a> on July 26, leading to a roughly 60% increase in its TVL. However, it has since tapered off to just above the level it was at prior to the announcement.&nbsp;","Layer 2 networks inherit security from Ethereum and are intended to reduce the cost of transactions.
