Dutch authorities claimed the people behind Tornado Cash made large-scale profits from these transactions.","Those protesting argue that Pertsev should not be held responsible for writing open-source code, regardless of how it\u2019s used by bad actors.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Family, friends and privacy advocates protest the arrest of Alex Pertsev in Amsterdam.
