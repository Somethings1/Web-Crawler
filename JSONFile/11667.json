Chainalysis\u2019 flagship investigation tool has historically been Reactor, which visualizes crypto wallets and their transactions in extensive webs.","While Reactor aims to improve upon publicly available block explorers, in cases of more intricate transaction histories, those webs can be hard to examine. For someone less familiar with blockchains, they are difficult to decipher. This is especially true when it comes to smart contract interactions, which can involve a number of intermediary wallets that are not at the core of the transaction.","\u201CThe solution to obfuscation is simplicity,\u201D Illum told The Block. Illum, who colleague and investigator Erin Plante described as \u201CJames Bond\u2019s Q,\u201D led the development of Storyline, which has been in beta testing within the company for the past eight months.","The Block reviewed a demonstration of Storyline, which was led by Illum. It draws on the same blockchains \u2014 mostly Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chains \u2014 and data sources as Reactor but filters out \u201Cwhat\u2019s noise and what is real,\u201D as Illum put it. Storyline identifies a number of intermediary wallets that are not core parties to a transaction.","Illum pulled up a case of wash trading in NFTs that went through aggregators. The aggregators allowed the NFTs to change hands for steadily increasing valuations, after which trades they returned to the original wallet which would sell it again. It\u2019s a project that Illum has worked on for some time.","The Reactor imagery is comprehensive but is a veritable Christmas tree of multicolor types of transactions and various intermediaries which, in addition to being opaque, does not clearly illustrate that those NFTs were going back to the original wallet that was selling them.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: Source: Chainalysis Reactor; wallet addresses blurred<\/em>","Storyline condenses these wallets into chronological transactions, as shown below.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: Chainalysis Storyline<\/em>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This was, however, a prepared project.

It noted the wallets were sanctioned and, conveniently, put the date of their sanctions designation on a timeline.","After a couple of minutes of clicking, Illum found a series of outgoing transactions to other Ethereum wallets beginning post-sanctioning, on May 14 \u2014 to wallets that have not yet ended up on the US sanctions list. <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Several of those transactions <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/142081\/ethereum-mixer-tornado-cash-now-blocks-sanctioned-addresses\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ultimately led to Tornado Cash<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: Chainalysis Storyline<\/em>","Illum demonstrated further outgoing transactions from Tornado Cash that happened shortly after those deposits and contained similar sums but noted that those required more research to confirm as affiliated.","The value is particularly valuable for presenting investigations to people who don\u2019t know and don\u2019t necessarily need to know the broader details of the blockchain. For criminal investigations, that can include prosecutors and juries.","\u201CThere is a flow to it that is followable and is fact. And I think that\u2019s something we should explain more to juries,\u201D said Santa Clara County cybercrime prosecutor Erin West of blockchain tracing during a panel. Of Storyline, she praised the value of \u201C[h]aving that kind of timeline to tell a story and show to a jury.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
