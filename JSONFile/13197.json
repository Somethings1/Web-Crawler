On the back of heavy inflows and a rising bitcoin price, their size is heading toward that of gold ETFs, which have a combined AUM of <a href=\"https:\/\/etfdb.com\/etfs\/commodity\/gold\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">around $97 billion<\/a>.","\u201CThey're going to pass gold ETFs at some point. That'll be a big thing,\u201D Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told The Block. \u201CI think the only thing that could derail all this is some kind of black swan.\u201D","Balchunas said the ETFs could be described as The Big Mo, referring to a situation where something catches fire and momentum propels it forward \u2014 such as with presidential campaigns.&nbsp;","\u201CThe mojo in these ETFs right now is off the chart. As long as the bitcoin price keeps complying and leaping higher \u2014 three or four out of five days a week \u2014 I don't really see anything slowing this trade down for a while because it's an upward spiral right now, and it's sort of feeding on itself,\u201D said Balchunas. \u201CThe higher the price goes, the more people get FOMO and are interested, and the more flows that come in, the higher the price goes.\u201D","Balchunas said it will eventually top off but noted that the numbers are still getting stronger each day. He pointed out that when VanEck\u2019s bitcoin ETF temporarily cut its fee to zero, it saw $180 million of inflows, a sign that interest in these ETFs is still very much there.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes\/embed\" title=\"Spot Bitcoin ETF Volumes\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","\u201CSo, I mean, they're white hot. That's a phrase I would use. It won\u2019t last forever. But the question is when do we hit a plateau?\u201D he said.","Balchunas speculated that it would take a significant market drop to bring them back to earth.","\u201CI think a significant downturn in equity markets is probably the one thing that could derail all this mojo right now. I'm not saying that would necessarily cause a decline in bitcoin, but it certainly would move this story to the back burner and into the back burner of people's minds. They'd be more concerned about their stocks because, for most people, that makes up a big part of the portfolio,\u201D he said.","\u201CSo I think as long as the markets, stocks and bonds stay flat or up, I don't really see anything in the way of a continued, growth pattern for these,\u201D Balchunas added.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
