This metric is lower for BlackRock and Fidelity ETFs by around four times, implying that these two ETFs show significantly more market breadth than GBTC, JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a report on Wednesday.","The second metric is based on measuring how much ETF closing prices deviate from their net asset value on average. This metric suggests that the ETF price deviation from the NAVs of the Fidelity and BlackRock spot bitcoin ETFs approached that of the SPDR Gold Shares ETF in the most recent week, implying a significant improvement in liquidity, the analysts said. Meanwhile, the deviations for the GBTC ETF have remained higher, indicating lower liquidity.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/spot-bitcoin-etf-assets-daily\/embed\" title=\"Spot Bitcoin ETF AUM (Daily)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","While those two metrics do not capture all dimensions of market liquidity \u2014 particularly market depth \u2014 there is already evidence that BlackRock and Fidelity's bitcoin ETFs have an advantage over GBTC in certain liquidity metrics related to market breadth, the analysts noted.","The analysts also pointed out that if GBTC fees aren't reduced, the fund will likely see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264543\/jpmorgan-gbtc-outflows-estimates-etf-conversion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">more outflows<\/a> and lose funds to other ETFs, especially BlackRock and Fidelity's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/272099\/jpmorgan-spot-bitcoin-etfs-36-billion-inflows\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin ETFs<\/a>.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/bitcoin-etf\/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows\/embed\" title=\"Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
