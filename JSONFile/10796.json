In the wake of the collapse of centralized service providers such as FTX and those companies caught up in the backlash, decentralized approaches are becoming a greater necessity, Tranchess CEO and co-founder Danny Chong told The Block in an interview.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe didn't really want to be a centralized entity,\u201D Chong said, adding that the company is working with node operators it can trust for technical execution. Offering a decentralized alternative to major competitive staking services like Lido, Tranchess provides a 4% return on staked ETH, according to its website.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A market has grown around liquid staking protocols in the absence of an exact date slated for the Shanghai upgrade on Ethereum. The upgrade would allow users to withdraw their staked ETH. The protocols allow users to stake tokens. In turn they would receive a token of equivalent value \u2014 such as qETH\u2014 that serves as a redeemable receipt, usable as collateral with participating DeFi platforms.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bringing with it lessons learned validating on BNB Chain, the Tranchess team took time to ensure its deployment on Ethereum would be seamless, according to Chong. The company today has just over $45 million in total value locked, which it hopes to grow by branching into the Ethereum liquid staking ecosystem.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CDeFi is now back into the limelight especially in the lights of liquid staking,\u201D Chong said. \u201CThe yields in terms of returns are stable and people know exactly where it comes from, which is from gas fees.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On the difficult topic of centralization on Ethereum and censorship, Chong admitted that the team doesn\u2019t have the perfect solution.\u201DIt's a topic that was widely discussed within the team.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Tranchess team recently met with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin in Singapore, who advocated the integration of zero knowledge proof protocols that allow for transactional verification and user privacy. The team is now looking into this.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The approach encouraged by Buterin appeals to Tranchess, according to Chong, who noted, \u201CYou do not have to reveal every single part of yourselves or information just because you need to prove who you are, what you do. I think that doesn't really make sense.\u201D<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
