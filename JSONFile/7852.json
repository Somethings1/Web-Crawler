Well in the 4 trading days since, we've seen net outflows of $150 million, including today's record $326 million outflow. And, BTC is down 16% since. So how did flows change on a dime?,\u201D Rudick said.","Rudick argued it was down to who was buying, with anecdotal evidence suggesting few wealth managers are putting clients into the ETFs and the average trade size for IBIT of $13,000 suggesting retail was behind the inflows \u2014 which can more easily stop when prices stop climbing. Rudick still expects inflows to outperform expectations over the long term, however.","Yesterday represented the second consecutive day of net outflows for the funds for the first time since January amid increased market volatility as bitcoin\u2019s price slid 10% from a peak of $68,136 to a low of $61,506.
