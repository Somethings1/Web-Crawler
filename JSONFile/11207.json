And vertical integration of trading platforms that give retail investors more direct access to markets, which the council believes, could have, \u201CFinancial stability and investor protection implications,\u201D due to other practices by those platforms, like automated liquidation of assets. &nbsp;&nbsp;","\u201CThe Council finds that crypto-asset activities could pose risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system if their interconnections with the traditional financial system or their overall scale were to grow without being paired with appropriate regulation, including enforcement of the existing regulatory structure,\u201D the report reads. The council singles out the bankruptcy of the Three Arrows Capital hedge fund and the collapse of TerraUSD as events pointing toward instability in the digital asset sector, supporting the need for legislation and increased regulation of cryptocurrency-related businesses.&nbsp;","The council unanimously approved the report.&nbsp;","Congress already began work on stablecoin and spot market legislation earlier this year. A Biden administration official said that the administration is not endorsing specific bills to achieve these goals at this time, but the report could boost momentum for existing efforts.","Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., authored a bill to give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more power over non-security cryptocurrency markets. Currently the CFTC wields power over derivatives and futures, but not actual spot markets for bitcoin and ether, the two digital assets not currently treated as securities. CFTC Chair Rostin Benham has testified in favor of that legislation, which has not yet received a committee vote, though Gensler <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7srL52cT6AhX8jokEHdy8Cr8QFnoECBIQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theblock.co%2Fpost%2F170415%2Fgensler-multiple-crypto-regulators-could-undermine-securities-rules&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VpjUVYG1JLv8luYwkMUo9\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told Congress<\/a> that having multiple regulators focused on crypto could undermine oversight efforts.","\"I look forward to working with Congress to achieve the public policy goals as laid out in the report, consistent with maintaining regulation to crypto security tokens and related intermediaries at the SEC,\" Gensler said during today's FSOC meeting. \"I hope that we don't inadvertently undermine securities law, which underlie the $100 trillion capital market.\"","House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and top committee Republican Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., have worked on a comprehensive stablecoin bill, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiXq-zZ3MT6AhWNlIkEHfHBCwQQFnoECBEQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theblock.co%2Fpost%2F171565%2Fdraft-stablecoin-bill-in-congress-to-require-fed-state-regulator-approval&amp;usg=AOvVaw2eHNy-iET_g206B7ZSkYE-\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent discussion draft<\/a>, though they are not believed to have reached an agreement yet, and chances of passage into law before the end of this current Congress look slim. If Republicans take control of both the House of Representatives and Senate &nbsp;\u2014 polls suggest they're favored to win the House while the Senate remains a toss-up \u2014 McHenry may prefer to wait until next Congress to finalize negotiations since committee chairmanship that comes with a flip of the House would give him more leverage.

That includes bank regulators using existing authority to supervise and examine digital asset firms that partner with banks or receive state or federal bank charters.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With additional reporting contributed by Stephanie Murray.&nbsp;<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
