Around $67 billion in capital has been provided by liquidity providers for DEXs in 2022, allowing users all over the world to own and trade hundreds of tokens. However, impermanent loss remains a key risk for liquidity providers on DEXs, reducing or eliminating returns made from trading fees. The need to deal with impermanent loss has become crucial for cryptocurrencies, as lower liquidity in DEXs could harm global adoption.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As part of the Genius Yield platform, the Genius DEX will become the first order-book DEX with concentrated liquidity built on Cardano that eliminates impermanent loss. The order-book model that the Genius DEX uses is similar to other major centralized exchanges. The most widely used DEXs built on blockchains such as Ethereum use the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, which causes impermanent loss. By not using the AMM model, the Genius DEX eliminates impermanent loss while also giving traders the same dynamic functionality of order-book exchanges.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Impermanent loss happens for liquidity providers when the value of their deposited assets in an AMM DEX is lower than if they had just held the assets. The AMM DEX was invented as a solution to having a DEX on account-based blockchains like Ethereum. Due to Ethereum\u2019s account based model that requires serialization of transactions to a global state, an order-book exchange where different transactions can happen in parallel to each other is cost prohibitive and improbable for an account based model.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To allow a functioning DEX on account models like Ethereum, the AMM DEX was introduced, which uses the constant product formula, <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">x*y = k<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The formula dictates the ratio that two assets must trade at for every transaction in a liquidity pool. As trades happen, the ratio of the assets could diverge from the market prices on centralized exchanges, causing impermanent loss for all liquidity providers with capital in a liquidity pool.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Genius DEX eliminates impermanent loss because it does not utilize the AMM model and its constant product formula. Therefore, the Genius DEX does not have impermanent loss. Instead, the Genius DEX uses the order-book model, which allows liquidity providers to create fragmented liquidity positions. Liquidity providers can also use concentrated liquidity on the Genius DEX, which allows them to designate what the price their fragmented liquidity positions can trade at for an asset pair. There is no fixed liquidity curve like the AMM model that dictates prices for every liquidity provider.&nbsp; While the Genius DEX eliminates the risk of impermanent loss, there are still risks to using any DEX.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.geniusyield.co\/?utm_source=theblockcrypto&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=impermanent_loss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Genius DEX<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> has an innovative architecture that takes full advantage of the properties inherent in Cardano\u2019s EUTxO model. The EUTxO model allows for parallel transaction processing, scalability, and determinism. The Genius DEX provides an efficient and cost-effective way for users to trade and for liquidity providers to optimize their return on capital.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Many tokens are based on decentralized applications (dApps) that perform important functions such as lending &amp; borrowing or decentralized storage. Many dApps would lose liquidity and functionality without DEXs. Impermanent loss could lead to liquidity providers removing their capital from DEXs, which could slow the growth of cryptocurrencies around the world.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Impermanent loss is a complex topic, that\u2019s why Genius Yield created an eBook that goes into more detail.&nbsp; To get a deep dive on impermanent loss, visit the website and download this free eBook:<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/ebook.geniusyield.co\/noimpermanentloss?utm_source=theblockcrypto&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=impermanent_loss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The 2022 Ultimate Guide to Impermanent Loss, and how to avoid it<\/b><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Genius Yield is committed to using its technology to democratize access to decentralized finance (DeFi).
