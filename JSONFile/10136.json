As such, the firm has so far limited the amount of miners in data centers to what\u2019s allowed by the police and it can only resume all storage power once after the investigation is over.","IPFSUnion is one of the top 10 Filecoin mining firms by total effective storage power and it also sells miners and computing power to end users directly or via distributors. It boasted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/101465\/china-new-infrastructure-filecoin-ipfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">state-owned capital<\/a> investment earlier this year from the Fuzhou government in China's Jiangxi province as well as investment from Chinese crypto venture firm Fenbushi Capital.","It's also not yet clear if IPFSUnion is accused of directly being involved in a Ponzi scheme or knowingly allowing its distributors to oversell equipment that doesn't exist.","But Ponzi schemes based on Filecoin miners have been somewhat <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2020\/07\/13\/inside-the-craze-for-filecoin-crypto-mining-in-china\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rampant<\/a> in China since 2018 after Protocol Labs raised $200 million in an initial coin offering in the year before.","Before Protocol Labs debuted Filecoin's testnet and mainnet in 2020, the network's design underwent various changes in terms of the equipment and software specifications suitable for mining FIL, the native cryptocurrency on the network.","But some Chinese companies and brokers exploited such information gap to sell subpar or fake Filecoin mining equipment to unwitting investors in China with promised returns. Protocol Labs had to make an anti-fraud statement in late 2018 to warn investors that it had no affiliation with any mining equipment sales.&nbsp;","Chinese media <a href=\"https:\/\/awtmt.com\/articles\/3496039?from=wscn\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> in March 2019 that one such self-claimed manufacturer allegedly scammed hundreds of people by $300 million for fake Filecoin miners via a multi-layer marketing scheme.","Â© 2023 The Block.
