They are \"programmable assets\" that can be used to unlock certain benefits, such as a game, an event, an experience or other goods and services.","She went on to say that if an NFT project launches its own token, it can grow its community in addition to its NFT holders. Fung gave an example of the recent launch of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/138156\/apecoin-tied-to-bored-ape-nft-ecosystem-debuts-with-planned-community-airdrop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ApeCoin<\/a>, which has helped expand the Bored Ape ecosystem beyond its collection holders since anyone can buy ApeCoin and be part of the Bored Ape community.","The Co:Create protocol will essentially provide a smart contracts platform that projects can use to mint NFTs and control royalties to be paid in their native token.","The initial version of the protocol will launch this fall, said Fung, adding that the mainnet will follow later.","Fung declined to comment on beta launch partners of Co:Create, but she said if \"blue-chip projects\" want to join, the platform will decide to onboard them.","Co:Create also plans to support big fashion brands that are exploring web3, such as Nike and Gucci. Fung said the firm is already in talks with several such brands. She believes that \"eventually there will be no such thing as web3 company, just as there's no longer an internet company,\" as every web2 company will adopt web3 tools and technologies.","Co:Create is currently focused on its development. With fresh funding in place, the project also plans to double its current team of 10 people and sign partnerships with brands and creators for its protocol, said Fung.","Eventually, Co:Create itself plans to convert into a DAO and launch its own native token, known as CO, to hand over the protocol's governance to a community of its NFT projects. Co:Create is currently part of Gesso Labs (pronounced \u201CJesso\u201D, the Italian word for chalk).","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
