It\u2019s the point in time when the Ethereum blockchain will shift from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake mechanism. It\u2019s just one step in a broader roadmap to make the Ethereum blockchain more scalable, more secure and more environmentally friendly. The momentous event has been in the works for years with collaboration taking place around the world from industry groups to individual developers and contributors.&nbsp;&nbsp;","With 119 core developers working on The Merge, however, and thousands of programmers contributing to the overall Ethereum protocol, it\u2019s impossible to give any one person credit for the blockchain's evolution. Regardless, some people undeniably have played crucial roles in making The Merge happen. Here are 10 people who have been integral in contributing to the historic switch.&nbsp;","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Who he is:<\/strong> Aidan Hyman is the CEO and co-founder of Chainsafe, a blockchain research and development company. Chainsafe works on a variety of projects across different blockchains.

Lodestar helps to remove a reliance on centralized providers to validate the network. The project is open source and written in the popular programming language Typescript, which also makes it accessible to the developer community. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin provided ChainSafe its first grant to develop Lodestar in 2018.
