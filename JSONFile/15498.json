The move inspired a few columns on Monday, including insightful ones from Fortune\u2019s Jeff John Roberts, which put it in context of gold\u2019s 17% rally, and Blockwork\u2019s Casey Wagner, who looked at how gas prices tend to move during crises in the Middle East.","Read more from CoinDesk\u2019s \u201CFuture of Bitcoin\u201D package. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","Yes, it\u2019s true that there were more buyers than sellers of oil and gold following the attack and more sellers than buyers of bitcoin \u2014 thus the former rose in value while the later dropped. But I\u2019ve always been of the view that intraday price movements for an asset as volatile as bitcoin say very little. The bad news is: gold is continuing to rise (like it did after the collapse of Lehman Brothers), while after a little pop on Sunday, bitcoin has been sagging lower and lower this week into the low $60K range.","While the looming threat of WWIII may be putting a damper on bitcoin, it\u2019s likely inklings emanating out from the Federal Reserve that it may hold interest rates higher for longer than anticipated because the economy is doing well that the market is responding to. Still, to raise the question of whether bitcoin is really a hedge \u2014 when in recent years it has clearly been behaving more and more like a tech stock \u2014 seems like the wrong thing to ask.","Bitcoin was largely uncorrelated with the S&P 500 before the pandemic, so clearly it can act as a countercyclical asset. The question is: What changed from then to now? Also, what exactly is bitcoin meant to hedge? Stocks? Inflation? U.S. Treasuries? Political turmoil? Is bitcoin meant to be an economic safe haven for all occasions?","There are likely a number of factors at play, including the increasing amount of bitcoin in circulation, number of holders and whales. But in some sense, the answer is clear enough, bitcoin is institutionalized. As Barron\u2019s reported around the time of the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in January:","\u201CBitcoin\u2019s volatility has still steadily declined since its launch more than a decade ago. Volatility \u2014 as measured by the 100-day average of daily price swings in percentage points \u2014 hasn\u2019t exceeded 4.5% since the introduction of bitcoin futures, which track the price of the spot token, according to Bauer. Since the 2021 launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF \u2014 a bitcoin futures fund \u2014 that metric hasn\u2019t exceeded 3.5%. Over the past year, volatility has stayed below 2.6%.\u201D","Now, volatility isn\u2019t everything (and bitcoin remains quite a bit more volatile than traditional equities), but it is a defining feature of the asset \u2014 at least as it was known to be. Did people think bitcoin would remain volatile forever? Austin Campbell, assistant professor at Columbia Business School, told CoinDesk recently, \u201CAny market growing from new to mainstream sees volatility due to small idiosyncratic events decrease as liquidity and scale increase.\u201D","See also: What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving","The release of spot bitcoin ETFs, some of which have been the fastest growing financial products this year, may accelerate this trend. As the barriers to entry drop, and bitcoin becomes more mainstream, bitcoin\u2019s correlation with stocks could tighten. The same people and fund managers now buying bitcoin, buy the S&P \u2014 the investor psychologies are merging.","In fact, the whole theory of \u201Chyperbitcoinization\u201D rests on the idea that as bitcoin adoption increases, its price volatility would dissipate so it could actually be a viable means of exchange. The trouble is this idea was predicated on the idea that as a widespread, circular bitcoin economy grew, the fiat system would plummet. Said differently, bitcoin was supposed to become less volatile and more uncorrelated. That was bitcoin\u2019s hedge.","This may stem from one of the foundational myths of bitcoin, that it is \u201Cdigital gold.\u201D It\u2019s a flawed metaphor though; good in the sense that an association with gold signaled that BTC could have value but bad in setting up the wrong expectations at a time before anyone really knew how bitcoin would behave.","That digital gold became the go-to description is likely why we have a mishmash of ideas about bitcoin today; it\u2019s a hedge, a store-of-value, a means of payment, a beta trade, a bet against fiat and, increasingly, a development platform. Everyone wants bitcoin to be everything all at once when in reality, over the past decade and half, it\u2019s basically done just one thing really well: sopping up excess liquidity.","To a large degree, we have no idea how bitcoin will perform if things hit the fan. As S&P analysts wrote in a 2023 report about macroeconomic impacts on crypto: \u201CUnprecedented levels of monetary easing by central banks across the world since 2008\/09 have increased money supply to record levels,\u201D suggesting bitcoin grew because the money supply did.","So maybe bitcoin will follow the pack for now, growing when the overall economy does, dropping when it drops. But the hedge bitcoiners are actually waiting for is more like a pop.","Edited by Bradley Keoun."],"entity":[{"type":"Federal Reserve","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Austin Campbell","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"4.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bauer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Casey Wagner","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"17%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gaza","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Columbia Business School","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jeff John Roberts","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Saturday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Middle East","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"3.5%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2.6%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bradley Keoun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$70,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Lehman Brothers)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$60K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$62,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Iran","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2008\/09","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","The Node","Newsletters","Bitcoin Halving","Inflation","inflation hedge"],"authors":["Daniel Kuhn"]}
