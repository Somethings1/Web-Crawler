That may lead to a slight shift in approach from financial watchdogs, trying to emphasize a carrot of more explicit guidelines to go with the stick of legal action against companies that don't follow them.&nbsp;","Treasury wants agencies to \u201Cdouble down\u201D on existing regulation, a senior official said during a Thursday press call previewing the reports, which were ordered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/137013\/white-house-releases-text-of-bidens-crypto-focused-executive-order\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">by President Joe Biden in March<\/a>. Senior administration officials requested to speak without direct attribution as a condition for fielding questions.&nbsp;","While calling for increased enforcement, Treasury also wants regulators to provide additional guidance for digital asset developers and other companies involved in cryptocurrencies, so that they better understand how to follow existing rules.

The reports are expected to carry weight with agency leaders and Capitol Hill while they contemplate ways to better fit cryptocurrencies into existing financial law.&nbsp;","\u201CThis is a new and very rapidly developing product space,\" said a senior official. \"Regulations need to be able to adjust to these new products and activities that are being offered.\u201D","Though Treasury's recommendations include an emphasis on more guidance and rulemaking from regulators, officials said the reports avoid specific legislative proposals. Multiple bills to change current laws that affect cryptocurrencies have been introduced on Capitol Hill, though none are likely to pass before the end of this Congress.","An official committed to, \"working with the Hill closely, to ensure that we\u2019re working arm-in-arm.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
