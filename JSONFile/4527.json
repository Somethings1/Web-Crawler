The project has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/150847\/frax-co-founders-propose-spending-20-million-to-buyback-fxs-token?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$20 million fund<\/a> for this purpose.","Ouroboros Capital, a cryptocurrency investment research firm, put forward a <a href=\"https:\/\/gov.frax.finance\/t\/optimizing-fip-77s-twamm-parameters\/2397\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal<\/a> on June 16 calling for a proactive optimization of the current token buyback strategy.","The proposal suggested a time-weighted average price (TWAP) buyback worth $1 million to be initiated when the FXS price dips below $5. If the price further slides to below $4, an additional $1 million buyback, set for a 1-month duration, is proposed to be activated. The key premise here is to purchase more FXS tokens for subsequent burning, as the price falls further.","This comes as the price of FXS \u2014 currently at $5.30 \u2014 falls toward $5, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/frax-share\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to CoinGecko.","\u201CI believe that the most judicious use of our revenue and capital is to buy and burn the FXS supply,\" Kazemian told The Block. \"Especially given the low valuations in a mature ecosystem due to macro market conditions and the state of the global economy, I can\u2019t envisage a more effective use of capital.\u201D","Kazemian expressed agreement with the general idea of accelerating the TWAP mechanism as the price drops to $4, $3 and $2, echoing Ouroboros Capital\u2019s suggestion. \u201CIf the price continues to fall, we should buy back more tokens more aggressively,\u201D he added.","Â© 2023 The Block.
