We're seeing the first parachains, we're seeing the first bridges between ecosystems,\" he says.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polkadot's parachains operate by allowing multiple blockchains to branch off their network. Polkadot deployed its first six parachain partnerships via the Kusama network on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rphmeier\/status\/1417536510778302464\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">July 20<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. \u201CAnd those are focusing on, for example, DeFi, on smart contracts, on layer 2 scaling, and on identity secure compute using some secure hardware,\" Habermeier continues.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Habermeier also outlined how Polkadot\u2019s Substrate platform works, on which Compound Labs recently launched a product called Gateway. Substrate works by reordering transactions in a block to suit the needs of DeFi institutions. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CYou're not going to have your profits constantly cut into by some aggressive miner who's reordering your transactions or sandwiching them,\u201D Habermeier explained. \u201CWhat that's going to do is essentially make it more difficult to exploit users who are using DeFi systems.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polkadot also expects to be able to create a more secure system by leveraging the security of multiple chains. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COne of the main goals of Polkadot is to try to allocate these security resources via market mechanisms to the chains that join the platform. And I think this is going to create a natural pressure towards competitive advantage.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Over time, Habermeier expects Polkadot will become more adaptable and appealing to DeFi and retail investors as the scalability of their proof of stake networks aim to keep fees lower between transactions.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CHaving chains that are just simply more scalable, which is one of the things that the migration to proof of stake networks is going to achieve... that's going to open the door and make it more inclusive, where people can just execute more strategies without as much capital behind them.\u201D<\/span>","During this episode Habermeier and Chaparro also discuss:&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
