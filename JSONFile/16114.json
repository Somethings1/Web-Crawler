That spurred a collection of digital artwork and meme tokens built on Bitcoin. Market capitalization of the latter category jumped to $137 million on Tuesday.","Still, most inscriptions are text-based, data shows. These cost much less than digital art or meme coins because network fees are dependent on the amount of data inscribed.","Monday saw over 372,000 unique inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, of which 371,000 were text based. Just 316 image-based inscriptions were created, with the remaining being applications or tokens.","Creators paid a cumulative 28 bitcoin (BTC) in fees for making the inscriptions, adding to the nearly 284 bitcoin in lifetime fees generated from Ordinals activity. That\u2019s over $8 million at current prices.","Meanwhile, tokens focused on Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem usage grew in price as inscriptions surged.","Stacks\u2019 stx (STX) token gained over 12% in the past 24 hours, outperforming the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks the broader crypto market and gained just 1.2%.","Stacks is a layer 2 companion chain for smart contracts focused on bitcoin, allowing for the creation of related financial products. Crypto funds such as North Rock say Stacks offers several advantages over blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, including lower fees, faster transaction times and enhanced security.","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"earlier this week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$137 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Bitcoin Request for Comment (BRC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"1.2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"North Rock","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dune Analytics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"CMI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Ordinals","NFTs"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
