Currently, Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem has two primary testnets: Goerli and Sepolia. However, Goerli is reportedly going to be deprecated soon, paving the way for the introduction of Holesky.","Holesky may have a potential supply of over 1 billion testnet ETH. This substantial supply is designed to address challenges that developers face when acquiring testnet ETH on the primary test networks. The large amount of testnet ETH will enable easier access for testing Ethereum smart contracts.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
