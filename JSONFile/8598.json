He added that BITO grew 10% in the last week from $1.8 billion on Jan. 2 and 18% within the last month from $1.7 billion on Dec. 9, 2023.&nbsp;","\"Many have pointed to speculation regarding a spot Bitcoin ETF as the driver of bitcoin\u2019s price appreciation, but it\u2019s worth noting that bitcoin was rallying for much of 2023 even in the face of the crypto-related bank issues in March, rising interest rates, and other 'challenges' at bitcoin exchanges,\" Hyman said.","\"At the same time, the increased interest around bitcoin calls to mind that it can be challenging and expensive to obtain short exposure to cryptocurrencies. BITI and SETH, futures-based short bitcoin and short ether ETFs, respectively, are available in brokerage accounts today, and are the only ETFs in the U.S. for investors who seek an opportunity to profit when the price of bitcoin or ether declines,\" he continued.","In December 2023, Cathie Wood\u2019s Ark Invest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268945\/ark-invest-sells-more-coinbase-shares-december-offloads-top-200-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">offloaded over $200 million<\/a> in Coinbase shares through its ETFs.
