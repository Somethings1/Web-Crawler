But it is a good example of a transformative technology that affects how the Bank needs to respond to the future of money,\u201D said Lane.","Preparing in advance is, thus, \u201Ccritical,\u201D said the central bank, although it will take \u201Cseveral years\u201D to build an actual prototype of digital currency.","For now, the Bank of Canada will consult with the \u201Cgovernments and key stakeholders in provinces and territories across Canada\u201D to learn if they want a digital currency and how they want it, Lane said.","Overall, the central bank wants to undergo an extensive consultation process. Last month, the Bank of Canada also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/53545\/uks-central-bank-to-explore-digital-currency\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">formed a working group<\/a> with the central banks of England, Japan, the European Union, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as the Bank for International Settlements. \u201CWe will use this platform to share experiences as we assess potential cases for a CBDC in our home jurisdictions,\u201D Lane concluded."],"hashtag":[]}
