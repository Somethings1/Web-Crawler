The DAO issues OHM tokens at a discount to investors in exchange for their cryptocurrencies, a process designed to grow its treasury over time.","These discounted OHM tokens are called bonds and users often stake the OHM they received from bonds on the DAO itself or use them as collateral on Fuse, an interest rate market powered by yield-generating protocol Rari Capital.&nbsp;","Judging by its performance chart, the OHM action has been in keeping with that of the broader crypto market with a significant rise in April and October 2021 before recent declines.&nbsp;","In assessing performance, the focus on market capitalization for OHM matters because of the project's rebasing function. Essentially, with rebasing, one's share of the supply will always stay consistent.","OHM market capitalization chart: CoinGecko","Key to the project was an emphasis on staking. The project encouraged users to stake their tokens, locking up more of the supply and reducing selling pressure. Toward the end of last year, 91.5% of the supply was being staked. It's currently around 85%. But clearly, this was not enough to prevent holders from selling eventually.","This 2022 slump, while in keeping with the losses in the broader crypto market, has also been attributed to massive profit-taking from major OHM holders. According to data from Etherscan, one OHM holder <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0x8f45cc66eba60229085440505c84e063366b4e3d71fd98c1121018a7978e1978\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">swapped<\/a> over 82,500 OHM tokens worth more than $11 million at the time. The trade happened on SushiSwap with the OHM tokens traded for the stablecoin DAI.","OHM has been on a downtrend since November 2021 and is down more than 60% year-to-date. &nbsp;This price drop also meant that overleveraged OHM long positions went underwater causing a cascade of liquidations that ultimately led to further downward pressure on the token price.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Editor's Note:&nbsp;<\/strong>This report and its headline have been edited and corrected to reflect a focus on OHM's market capitalization, rather than its price.&nbsp;<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
