He said he was using MetaMask instead of Nest to claim as he had a \u201Ctest version installed and was fixing some bugs.\u201D If he had used his own product, the wallet would have caught it, Lou added.","\u201CTransaction simulation is a must,\u201D Lou told The Block. \u201CNest Wallet has this built in but MetaMask lacks it completely. This could have been completely avoided.\u201D Lou also advised users to always seek out official X accounts for links and consider multisig wallets for extra security.","Lou is seemingly not the only one affected by such an attack, with other victims <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/JacobCanfield\/status\/1742069643710283969?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reporting<\/a> their wallets were drained after clicking on similar fake links via fake X accounts.","Acknowledging the issue, the project behind LFG <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/LessFnGas\/status\/1742042359737590021?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">posted<\/a>, \u201CWe are aware of several scam accounts impersonating us and are reporting them.
