Now, one of that letter\u2019s recipients is suing the agency on Tax Day, alleging it violated taxpayers\u2019 constitutional rights.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Plaintiff James Harper filed a suit against the IRS, its commissioner Charles P. Rettig and unnamed IRS agents for their role in the alleged unlawful seizure of information that identified him as a crypto holder. Harper contends that the IRS violated his rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In August of 2019, Harper received a letter from the IRS related to his crypto holdings, which read: \u201CYou have had one or more accounts containing virtual currency but may not have properly reported your transactions involving virtual currency.\u201D The wording closely resembles that of a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/33760\/cryptocurrency-investors-start-receiving-letters-from-the-irs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> The Block obtained last year.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Harper argues that he accurately and diligently reported his holdings from the year he first held bitcoin. Besides that, he says, he only dealt with crypto exchanges where he argues he had a \u201Creasonable expectation of privacy,\u201D and therefore the IRS shouldn\u2019t have gotten access to his financial history without a court order.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It remains unclear exactly where the IRS obtained the information it used to build its list of warning letter recipients. When it sent the letters, the agency said the recipients were identified \u201Cthrough various ongoing IRS compliance efforts.\u201D Harper alleges that these efforts entailed soliciting user information from crypto exchanges he used, and that this violated laws related to unlawful search and seizure and due process.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to the lawsuit filing, Harper opened a Coinbase account in 2013, for bitcoin he received as payment for consulting work. He liquidated those holdings in 2015 and sent the remaining bitcoin from his Coinbase account to a hardware wallet. By 2016, he no longer held bitcoin on Coinbase, but&nbsp; he and his wife continued to use exchanges Abra and Uphold to liquidate bitcoin.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2016, the IRS obtained a court order to compel Coinbase to produce customer information including transaction logs, taxpayer identification number, name and address among other data for accounts that exceeded $20,000 in any kind of transaction from 2013\u20132015. That added up to 14,355 account holders, according to Coinbase.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the new lawsuit alleges that in addition to that, IRS agents \u201Cissued an informal demand for Mr. Harper\u2019s financial records to Abra, Coinbase, and\/or Uphold, with which one more or more exchanges complied.\u201D It notes that all three said in their privacy agreements that they wouldn\u2019t give up personal data without a subpoena or warrant.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Fourth Amendment protects a person\u2019s property, including their \u201Cpapers,\u201D saying they can\u2019t be searched or seized without probable cause. Harper\u2019s argument alleges that in today\u2019s world, one\u2019s financial information is akin to their \u201Cpapers,\u201D and the IRS\u2019s intention to remind crypto holders of their tax burdens was not enough to legally demand private information.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe John Doe summons issued to Abra, Coinbase and\/or Uphold did not relate to a particular person or ascertainable group or class of persons as required by statute, but to all owners of virtual currencies based only on a gross judgment that some virtual currency holders may not comply with their tax obligations,\u201D read the lawsuit.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Harper claims the IRS violated due process laws outlined in the Fifth Amendment since those whose information was at the center of the demands weren\u2019t issued summons or otherwise notified that the IRS was attempting to seize their information, meaning they couldn\u2019t fight to protect it. <\/span>"],"hashtag":["IRS"]}
