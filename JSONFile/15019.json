On average, at current market rates, it should be around 10% APY. Meanwhile, the stablecoin can also be used at the same time for liquidity mining or on lending platforms.","A portion of the yield will be reserved to secure the protocol\u2019s insurance fund in the event that derivatives trade at a discount to spot. For example, if a market is in \u201Cbackwardation,\u201D the insurance fund is used to compensate depositors and keep the position fully hedged. The insurance fund will begin accumulating once the protocol goes fully live in Q4, and after a governance token sale in October or November, said Inami.","Read more: Solana\u2019s Mango Markets DEX Raises $70M in MNGO Token Sale","Under the hood, the perpetual swap protocol is connected to a decentralized exchange (DEX); to begin with, UDX is working with Mango Markets, the biggest DEX on Solana.","\u201CIf the derivative DEX fails, then the UXD will not be backed 100%. And so you\u2019re taking on kind of like the counterparty risk of the derivative DEX,\u201D said Inami.","But in view of the shortcomings of many stablecoins in the market, Inami said he was surprised no other project has so far leveraged delta-neutral positions as a way of pegging.","\u201CI have wondered why no one else has tried it,\u201D Inami said. \u201CI guess the implementation has been difficult because it\u2019s only recently that derivative DEXs came out. But with Mango Markets on Solana we can now create this type of stablecoin.\u201D"],"entity":[{"type":"Solana blockchain","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Solana Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$120 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"September 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Dylan Macalinao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Mango Markets on Solana","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Defiance Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Origin Dollars","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Raj Gokal","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Multicoin Capital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CMS Holdings","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anatoly Yakovenko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana\u2019s Mango Markets DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kento Inami","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"delta","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mercurial Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$70M","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Origin","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"DEX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mango Markets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UXD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Inami","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Stablecoins","Solana"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
