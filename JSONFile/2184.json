Unlike traditional network firewalls, which monitor incoming and outgoing transactions to identify threats using predefined security criteria, Firewall employs rollups \u2014 aggregating multiple transactions into a single batch \u2014 and \"programmable transaction finalization rules\" to intercept exploits before they are recorded on the blockchain. The \"proof-of-exploit\" consensus mechanism it is creating classifies smart contract exploits as \u201Cinvalid state transitions\u201D to be reversed.","\"Blockchain consensus is meant to formalize social consensus into programmatic rules. We know it's already a social consensus that smart contract exploits shouldn't be accepted as valid state transitions, you see this clearly after every exploit,\" <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the firm's co-founder Devan Purhar told The Block<\/span>. \"Do people refer to the Kyber 'transactions' that netted $50 million?
