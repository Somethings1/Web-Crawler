For this reason, they serve as a critical piece of infrastructure for the blockchain sector. Within the infrastructure niche, the RPC continues to be an important vertical and is occupied largely by both centralized and decentralized&nbsp; players including Ankr and competitors such as Infura, QuickNode, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/149849\/alchemy-is-bringing-its-blockchain-node-infrastructure-to-solana\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alchemy<\/a> and others.<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
