Optimizing for any one or two will be at the cost of the others. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Older blockchains like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and even Ethereum, work by having most of the participants on the network running full nodes. These full nodes verify every transaction on the network and store the complete data history of the chain. They tend to have high security and decentralization but are not usually scalable. Bitcoin can only process about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockchain.com\/charts\/transactions-per-second\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">five<\/a> transactions per second.

Such chains have high transaction speeds at low cost, for example, Fantom can process <a href=\"https:\/\/fantom.foundation\/blog\/tps-or-ttf-understanding-blockchain-speed\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">25,000<\/a> transactions per second. So, they are scalable, but they are not as decentralized. Apart from not being so decentralized, their networks can become bloated and much more expensive, and difficult to run.
