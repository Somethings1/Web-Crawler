Heyn said.","The phased launch of the SOMA Finance marketplace is underway, with its SOMAguard onboarding platform currently operational. The upcoming SOMA token sale will mark the debut of its SOMAstarter launchpad, followed by the decentralized exchange SOMAswap, with additional products to follow.","\u201COffering a compliant bridge between DeFi and traditional financial systems was no simple feat, but we are confident in our secure onboarding process and comprehensive encryption protocols.\u201D SOMA Finance co-founder and CEO of MANTRA John Patrick Mullin added.","In addition to Regulation CF, digital asset and NFT offerings, SOMA Finance said it would also enable Regulation D, Regulation S and Regulation A listings while facilitating the compliant trading and issuance of tokenized equities and security token offerings.","Regulated activity on the platform will be managed by Tritaurian, leveraging SOMA Finance\u2019s technology.","Â© 2023 The Block.
