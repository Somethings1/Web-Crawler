The exchange went down because it couldn't handle the number of trades being made, which had doubled in size.","The ruling initially went against the investors but it was later overturned on appeal. \"The burden or the cost of technological failures should be shouldered by the service operator, not services users who pay commission for the service,\" said the appeals court.","Â© 2023 The Block.
