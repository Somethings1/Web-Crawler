Huobi told CoinDesk the company has committed $30 million to the accelerator.","Projects that have already entered the accelerator include Mastercard-backed smart contract company SupraOracles and TikTok rival Chingari.","\u201CLiquidity support from the centralized exchange has always been seen as a critical milestone for crypto startups,\u201D Unica Yin, investment director of Huobi Ventures, said in a statement. \u201CThrough the collaboration with Republic from an accelerator perspective, we envision that this would provide the comprehensive support to the project throughout the entirety of its life cycle, thus elevating product value in applicable scenarios rather than merely to look for quick returns in investment.\u201D","The global accelerator launches as China continues its crackdown on the crypto industry. Last month, Huobi Global said it would stop serving existing China-based users by the end of the year after the People\u2019s Bank of China declared that virtual currency businesses were illegal and banned overseas exchanges from serving users in the region.","Huobi Ventures has launched three funds to date, including one for blockchain technology, one for the Huobi Eco Chain (HECO) public blockchain and one for non-fungible tokens.","Meanwhile, Republic\u2019s fund adviser arm just launched a $60 million seed fund, its first and flagship fund, and has already deployed about $11 to $12 million of that money."],"entity":[{"type":"Huobi crypto exchange","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Unica Yin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Mastercard","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$12 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Huobi Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Huobi Global","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$11","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Huobi Eco","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$30 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"TikTok","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"People\u2019s Bank of China","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$60 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Huobi","Accelerators"],"authors":["Brandy Betz"]}
