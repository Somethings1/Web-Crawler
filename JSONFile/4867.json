Back in January, Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss tweeted that \"We look forward to defending ourselves against this manufactured parking ticket.\"","The lawsuit represented another leg in the SEC's continued crackdown on the crypto space. SEC Chair Gary Gensler raised red flags about crypto-tied lending in the agency's press release announcing the enforcement action against Genesis and Gemini.","\"Today\u2019s charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws,\" Gensler <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2023-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> in a press release at the time of the lawsuit's filing.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
