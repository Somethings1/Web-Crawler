Owners of this equipment are either liquidating the assets or shipping them outside the country to wherever there's vacant hosting capacity \u2014 given the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/110978\/no-way-back-from-chinas-bitcoin-mining-clampdown-says-the-blocks-wolfie-zhao\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">unlikelihood<\/a> of the government reversing the policy in the foreseeable future.","\"We were receiving requests for 100 megawatts on average over the past several weeks although some of them may be duplicated through brokers,\" he said.","In early June, even before China's Xinjiang and Sichuan provinces \u2014 the top two mining hubs at the time \u2014 handed down the actual shutdown orders, it was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/107104\/china-bitcoin-miners-state-council-crackdown\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that the available hosting capacity outside China would be nowhere enough to absorb all the potential demand.","That posed as much a challenge for Chinese bitcoin miners as an opportunity for colocation providers overseas as they turn to regions like Kazahkstan, Russia and North America for their exodus plans. Although those plans could take months, if not years, to complete.&nbsp;","\"We may not see the hash rate go back to the all-time-high level until Q2\/Q3 next year. That's my hunch,\" said Perrill, adding that the supply crunch has shifted from machines to hosting capacity.","Compute North isn't the only colocation provider that has upcoming plans to scale up capacity. Russia-based BitRiver said in April that its third data center was expected to be operational <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/101327\/bitcoin-mining-bitriver-electricity-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in September<\/a> with another 100 megawatts.&nbsp;","U.S. colocation provider Bit5ive is also set to manage the development of a 100 megawatts facility, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/news-release\/2021\/07\/07\/2258912\/0\/en\/ISW-Holdings-Closes-on-Its-1st-phase-of-over-100MW-Georgia-Crypto-Mining-Farm-Capable-of-Driving-Over-100M-in-Annual-Gross-Revs.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent announcement<\/a>.","Bitmain previously told The Block that they are sourcing electricity worldwide and encouraging customers and partners to invest in infrastructure rather than just hosting machines. The Chinese mining equipment manufacturer giant said it is looking to co-invest in mining facilities by taking up to 20% stakes.","At the same time, the supply gap remains significant. Roughly 90 million terahashes per second (TH\/s) of computing power on the Bitcoin network has gone offline since China's shutdown orders. (See a timeline recapping the events <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/110499\/a-timeline-of-chinas-bitcoin-mining-crackdown-and-how-it-goes-beyond-environmental-concerns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">here<\/a>.)","In Xinjiang alone, those who had been operating before June 9 had a combined capacity of 1.9 gigawatts of energy capacity before they were shut down. More went offline in Sichuan in the weeks afterwards.","Although it's unclear how much energy capacity exactly had powered up the hash rate that went offline in China, a lower and upper bound range can be estimated.","The most advanced and latest generation of mining equipment on the market has an efficiency rate of around 40 watts per TH\/s of computing power whereas the least efficient model on the market consumes about 100 watts per TH\/s.","That means the 90 million TH\/s of computing power could be using an energy capacity in the range of 3.6 to nine gigawatts, with an average around six gigawatts.&nbsp;","The crackdown is not just affecting Chinese mining companies but also those listed in the U.S.","BIT Digital, a Nasdaq-listed bitcoin miner, who is also one existing hosting customer of Compute North, disclosed that it had a total of 43,606 miners with a combined hash rate of 2.4 million TH\/s as of April 30 with <a href=\"https:\/\/bit-digital.com\/press-releases\/bit-digital-inc-announces-first-quarter-of-fiscal-year-2021-financial-results\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">80% of them<\/a> generating revenue from inside China.","It had 19,060 units in Sichuan, 12,830 units in Xinjiang and 3,200 units in Yunnan. At the time, only 7,000 units were being hosted in U.S. facilities.&nbsp;","BIT Digital has not made any public disclosure on what it plans to do with the equipment located in China and has not responded to The Block's request for comment.","Meanwhile, Hong Kong-listed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/110077\/sichuan-bitcoin-mining-crackdown-hong-kong-loto-interactive\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Loto Interactive<\/a>, owned by the New York Stock Exchange-listed BIT Mining, had all of its three mining facilities in Sichuan shut down last month, which had a capacity of around 400 megawatts and made up almost the entirety of Loto's revenues in 2020.","Â© 2023 The Block.
