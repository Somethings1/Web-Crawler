I think the word was used casually or perhaps translated inaccurately. ZEB IT wasn't accused of deliberately doing anything unethical or illegal. And as we've said, we're 100% in favor of being properly regulated,\" Rangala told The Block.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nA request for comment to the state minister was not returned by press time.","Ddeepak Kapoor, founder of think tank BEGIN India, which works with the Indian government and investigative agencies to fight crypto crimes, told The Block that the ministry took a clear stand in the Zebpay case, which is a welcome development.","\"It would be more appreciable and in broader interest, if such ambiguities in tax computation for crypto and blockchain businesses are removed. A clear policy will ease the pain for the government and businesses alike,\" said Kapoor.","Rangala further told The Block that ZEB IT has gone under liquidation as part of new management and that Zebpay now operates under Awlencan Innovations India.","He stressed that there have been no further inquiries into ZEB IT or any other company associated with Zebpay.","Zebpay relaunched in India this January under a new leadership team. The exchange closed down in September 2018, a few months after the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) banking ban went into effect.
