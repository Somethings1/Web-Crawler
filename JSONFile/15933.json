This is quite the responsibility. And also one of the main reasons why we are so reluctant to just slap any 'innovative' tech into the reference client. Still, I am proud of what we achieved and thankful to be part of such a great community.\"","According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of dogecoin started to climb around May 2017 after years of stagnation. Technology development on the tongue-in-cheek token has proceeded in fits and starts, namely because its developers are all volunteers, contributing to it in their spare time.","Bailey Reutzel contributed reporting.","Dog image via CoinDesk's archive."],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2015","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Patrick Lodder","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bailey Reutzel","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$0.01","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"400 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Shiba Inu","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$101 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Max Keller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jackson Palmer","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinMarketCap","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Dogecoin","News","Markets","All-Time High","Markets News"],"authors":["Wolfie Zhao"]}
