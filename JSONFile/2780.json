Additionally, it will have a verifier component to help validate user transactions on-chain. Data availability is essential for scaling solutions like Momoka because it ensures that off-chain data remains accessible and verifiable when needed for on-chain settlement, dispute resolution or audits.<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update:<\/strong> Lens Protocol has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/228787\/lens-protocol-renames-scaling-solution-bonsai\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">renamed<\/a> the Bonsai scaling solution to Momoka.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
