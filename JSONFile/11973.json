Earlier in October, the marketplace <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177414\/solana-nft-platform-magic-eden-opts-for-optional-royalty-payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> a switch to an optional royalty model \u2014 a move that meant those buying or selling NFTs on its marketplace could choose what percentage cut of the sale is returned to the original artist.","The decision was controversial and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/178362\/magic-eden-coo-calls-0-royalties-a-prisoners-dilemma\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sparked<\/a> criticism from a plethora of collections. At the time, co-founder Zhuoxun \u201CZedd\u201D Yin likened the decision to a case of prisoner\u2019s dilemma.","Dubbed the Open Creator Protocol (OCP), the new tool is built on top of Solana\u2019s SPL managed-token standard. From Dec. 2, creators launching new collections who opt into using the protocol will be able to protect their royalties and use customizable token transferability, the company said.&nbsp;","OCP will allow creators to ban marketplaces that have not enforced royalties on their collections. For new collections that don\u2019t adopt the code, royalties will remain optional on Magic Eden.","Customizable transferability could include a collection\u2019s tokens remaining untradable before the mint closes, or limitations on tradability by time, the total number of trades, or metadata text. Creators are now able to gamify the rules of their own collection\u2019s trading behavior, Magic Eden said. At the same time, the marketplace is rolling out bulk transfers on the platform \u2014 so collectors can move their NFTs freely for collections using the Open Creator Protocol.&nbsp;","The code will enable a dynamic feature, which specifies a relationship between an NFT\u2019s sale price and royalty amount via a linear price curve. This will potentially reduce the nominal value of royalties for buyers who pay a higher price for the NFT.","\u201CThe Solana community has been waiting for solutions to NFT royalties,\u201D Jack Lu, CEO and co-founder of Magic Eden said in a statement. \u201CWe have been in active conversations with multiple ecosystem partners to identify solutions for creators in a timely manner.\u201D&nbsp;","On launch day, there will be a free mint, which will supply a couple of thousand gift boxes \u2014 some of which will contain prizes that include a free MacBook Air laptop, whitelist access to Tomorrowland\u2019s December mint (The Symbol of Love and Unity), access to Genopet\u2019s game, and free NFTs from Degen Trash Panda and Liberty Square.&nbsp;","As the debate on creator remuneration in web3 has reached a fever pitch, Magic Eden follows marketplaces such as OpenSea in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/183518\/opensea-creates-tool-to-help-nft-collections-enforce-royalties-on-chain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">attempting<\/a> to find ways to enforce creator royalties on-chain. The code in OpenSea's smart contract restricts NFT sales to marketplaces that enforce creator fees. In the coming months, the company will produce additional tools serving a similar purpose and solicit community feedback on the developments.&nbsp;","Meanwhile, other marketplaces have moved to different models. Stepn's new NFT marketplace Mooar <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/180785\/stepn-founders-bright-idea-for-its-new-nft-marketplace-compulsory-royalties\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> with a subscription-based service for trading.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
