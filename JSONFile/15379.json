As Florida\u2019s governor, he signed legislation prohibiting the use of central bank digital currencies within the state (although some lawyers question if the law does what it says).","\u201CI just do not have the itch to have to control everything that people may be doing in this space,\u201D he said. \u201CBitcoin represents a threat to them, they\u2019re trying to regulate it out of existence.\u201D","During the interview, DeSantis insisted on Congressional authorization for a CBDC, vowing to avoid it during his potential presidency, due to concerns over its potential misuse to influence politically unfavorable purchases.","Some have argued, however, that CBDCs enshrine constitutional protections over commerce, giving these unfavorable purchasers or merchants \u2013 such as someone buying ammunition or a pornographer selling their creations \u2013 a defense against un-banking that can\u2019t be used when dealing with a private company.","Regardless, CBDCs might be the newest wedge issue in U.S. politics.","In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Samuel Armes, president of the Florida Blockchain Business Association, which helped draft DeSantis\u2019 anti-CBDC bill, said that DeSantis\u2019 office has gotten more phone calls about CBDCs than any of the usual issues.","A recent poll from Quinnipiac University shows that DeSantis still trails former president Donald Trump among Republican and Republican-leaning voters, with 56% supporting Trump followed by 25% for DeSantis.","DeSantis isn't the first Republican candidate to mention bitcoin. Former pharma entrepreneur and longshot contender Vivek Ramaswamy said onstage at Bitcoin 2023 in Miami that the next election should be a \"referendum of fiat currency\" and has also come out against CBDCs with a \"hell no.\"","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"Ron DeSantis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin 2023","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"David Sacks","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Florida","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"DeSantis","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vivek Ramaswamy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DeSantis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Miami","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Quinnipiac University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"56%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Republican Party","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elon Musk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Samuel Armes","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Florida Blockchain Business Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Donald Trump","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"}],"hashtag":["Elon Musk","Florida","CBDC","Election 2024","Ron DeSantis"],"authors":["Sam Reynolds"]}
