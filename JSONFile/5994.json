Liquid-cooled mining offers more efficient heat management and potentially higher hardware performance compared to traditional air-cooled mining. However, it typically involves higher setup costs and more complex maintenance.","Peak Mining previously <a href=\"https:\/\/eqs-cockpit.com\/cgi-bin\/fncls.ssp?fn=redirect&amp;url=2b3d015ebe8ec2add647be3039c7b614&amp;application_id=1763035&amp;site_id=news_data&amp;application_name=news\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">signed<\/a> a contract with MicroBT in September \u2014 worth $150 million \u2014 for over 7 Exahashes of the latest generation WhatsMiners, making it one of the world's largest Bitcoin miners. The new financing will also be used to acquire sophisticated Nvidia AI hardware, enabling Northern Data\u2019s Taiga Cloud business to expand its generative artificial intelligence cloud services.","Finally, the facility will be used to grow the group\u2019s portfolio of Ardent Data Centers, the company said.","\u201CTether Group is proud to support Northern Data Group in its ability to provide customers access to flexible, energy efficient high performance computing infrastructure,\" Tether Group incoming CEO Paolo Ardoino said.","This loan facility, capped at 575 million EUR, is intended to be drawn over the next year. It will be covered using the company's profits and will not be part of Tether's stablecoin consolidated reserves. The transaction is facilitated through a separate investment vehicle within Tether Group to ensure segregation, Ardoino told The Block in a statement.","\"As publicly disclosed in our reports, Tether has been achieving an average of ~1B per quarter in net operating results as reported over the last quarters and the project remains the same going forward, due to the high interest rates on US T-Bills,\" Ardoino said. \"A significant portion of these profits has been prudently retained within our reserves, contributing to the accrual of excess reserves. This strategy has enabled us to overcollateralize our stablecoins by as much as 104%.\"","\"Additionally, as part of our disclosed plans, a minor portion of these profits will be strategically reinvested in data, energy and P2P communications infrastructure,\" he added.","Prior to this loan agreement, Tether made a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252360\/tether-makes-strategic-investment-in-northern-data-group\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">strategic investment<\/a> in Northern Data in September to collaborate on AI, communication and data storage initiatives.&nbsp;","\"This investment is significant for Tether as it demonstrates its determination to support emerging technology,\" Tether wrote in a <a href=\"https:\/\/tether.to\/en\/tether-makes-strategic-investment-into-northern-data-group-set-to-become-the-biggest-independent-ai-player-in-europe\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/a> at the time.
