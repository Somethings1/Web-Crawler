The execution layer will undergo the Shanghai upgrade, while on the consensus layer it\u2019s known as \u201CCapella.\u201D So developers are cleverly referring to the whole thing as \u201CShapella.\u201D","To understand what the two layers are, one needs to understand Ethereum prior to when it went through the last upgrade, the Merge.","Ethereum\u2019s old proof-of-work blockchain was also known as the execution (application) layer. When Ethereum started its proof-of-stake (PoS) chain, also known as the consensus layer, developers were originally going to transition over to just the PoS chain. But that seemed to be too complicated of a task for developers, so they decided to merge the two chains together \u2013 hence the \"Merge.\"","Now, the two layers have different functions that help move the Ethereum blockchain forward. The execution layer is where all smart contracts and protocol rules live, while the consensus layer is in charge of making sure that all validators on the network are following those rules.","The Ethereum Foundation did not come out with a specific blog that has rebranded the upgrade to Shapella, but over time, the core developers have started to call it Shapella.","On Twitter, Ethereum developers shared that Shapella went live on Sepolia earlier this week, referring to the two components of the upgrade.","Read more: \u2018Ethereum\u2019 vs \u2018Eth 2\u2019: What\u2019s in a Name?"],"entity":[{"type":"earlier this week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sepolia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shapella","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shapella","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ethereum Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Shanghai","Shanghai upgrade","Staked","ETH","Ether"],"authors":["Margaux Nijkerk"]}
