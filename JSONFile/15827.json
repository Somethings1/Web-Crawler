That being said, the overall zcash ecosystem will still need some time to add new addresses, Hadmon wrote.","Hadmon added that users cannot yet transfer funds from old shielded addresses to the new version without showing amounts, writing:","No timeline was presented for when this tool may be released.","Following the upgrade's implementation, network data indicates that zcash's hashrate briefly fell to 1.5 GH\/s, lower than it has been in nearly three weeks. By press time, however, it had returned to roughly 2 GH\/s.","Zcash's hashrate has been fluctuating between just under 1.5 GH\/s and 2 GH\/s for more than a month now.","Trees image via Shutterstock"],"entity":[{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hadmon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Zerocoin Electric Coin Company","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"GH\/s.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"97 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Shutterstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elise Hadmon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"90 percent","content":"PERCENT"}],"hashtag":["News","Zcash","hard-forks","Sapling","Upgrades","other-public-protocols","Technology News"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De"]}
