Furthermore, the risk from investing in protocols offering yields <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">higher<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> than Ethereum\u2019s could be assessed relative to Ethereum's hypothetical risk-free 4.8% yield.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In addition to creating a benchmark yield for the industry, Pal thinks the decrease in the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s energy consumption after the merge could result in it becoming an institutional favorite compared to the more energy-intensive, proof-of-work consensus mechanism used by the Bitcoin blockchain. As Pal explains:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CTo have a benchmark yield in the second largest cryptocurrency, when everybody wants to allocate over time to web3 as a theme, that is not counter to the 'FUD' of the ESG narrative that Bitcoin has to battle with \u2014 it becomes incredibly attractive for institutions to allocate.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Additionally, Pal claims he has personally been adding the most crypto to his portfolio since November of 2020, stating \u201Cthe risk-reward is now becoming super ludicrous, so it dwarfs anything else.\u201D<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro and Pal also discuss<\/span><\/i>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chainalysis.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis<\/a>&nbsp;&amp;<\/em>&nbsp;<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iwc.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IWC Schaffhausen<\/a><\/em><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About Chainalysis<\/strong><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nChainalysis is the leading blockchain data platform.
