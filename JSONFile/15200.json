The interest rates on BlockFi\u2019s loans are much better than the annual percentage rates on the credit card, Prince added.","","","Read more: Coinbase to Launch Crypto Debit Card in US for Retail Spending","","","The crypto lender is putting out the new product about a quarter behind schedule because of how many of its partner organizations had to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ","","","\u201CYou have to work with quite a few partners to bring a credit card to market,\u201D Prince told CoinDesk in August of this year. \u201CSome of them haven\u2019t really handled the transition from being fully in-office to being fully remote as smoothly as companies like BlockFi have.\u201D ","","","Visa is acting as the card issuing network, Evolve Bank & Trust provides the Bank Identification Number (BIN) that allows BlockFi to connect to the payments network and Deserve is managing the payments flow technology. ","","","The card spends dollars but earns rewards in bitcoin.

For the first year, BlockFi is giving users who spend at least $3,000 on the card in the first three months a stipend of $250. ","","","The revenue for BlockFi will be one part interchange fee (which will be split between customer rewards and revenue) and another part annual fee, Prince added.","","","\u201CThis will add payments revenue as a category\" on the balance sheet, Prince said. \u201CPayments generally is a revenue type that gets pretty healthy multiples in capital markets.\u201D ","","","Read more: BlockFi Raises $50M From Universities, NBA Star, Others as Crypto Lending Soars","","","Since the credit card is a premium Visa card, BlockFi plans to offer more credit and debit cards in the future that are also tied to customers\u2019 crypto accounts.
