Zash initially created a social investing app \"verified by real on-chain and broker data\" but pivoted to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/nft-overview\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NFT data<\/a> due to a lack of reliable and accurate blockchain data, specifically for NFTs.

CoinGecko co-founder and COO Bobby Ong declined to disclose the size of the team, but LinkedIn shows Zash employs up to 10 members. Ong also declined to comment on the size of the deal, but Zash was at a pre-seed funding round level in February of this year when it raised an undisclosed amount from some investors, including Cogitent Ventures and WWVentures, according to Crunchbase data.","CoinGecko was founded in 2014 and competes with the likes of CoinMarketCap, which Binance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/60371\/binance-is-set-to-acquire-coinmarketcap-the-deal-could-be-worth-as-much-as-400-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acquired<\/a> in 2020 for around $400 million.","Â© 2023 The Block.
