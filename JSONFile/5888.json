Profits from the 41.8 TWh of curtailed wind electricity at an investment of $6.9 billion in ASICs would have been somewhere in the realm of $2.96 Billion. For reference, China is planning to spend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/01\/05\/world\/asia\/china-renewable-energy-investment.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$360 billion on renewables by 2020<\/a>.","Investing $5 billion into ASIC chips would certainly have inflated the overall hashrate and reduced the profitability, but I tried to account for this by using overly conservative estimates for the other parameters and by assuming the ASICs were used sporadically when there was curtailable energy instead of running them constantly.","Taking this formula and applying it to today\u2019s network hashrate (45.67 Exahash) and BTC price ($3,436.89) while purchasing and using 2017 ASICs (14 TH\/S) at today\u2019s price of $300 per S9 ASIC yields an estimated profit of $351,851,722 off of 11 TWh of curtailed solar electricity, and an estimated profit of $1.34 billion from 41.8 TWh of curtailed wind electricity.","Calculating the past values of what VRE producers <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">could have made<\/i> had they integrated ASIC chips is inherently inexact, but the takeaways are as follows.","It appears profitable to integrate ASIC chips with VRE sources at the time of deployment - by building them into solar panel installations, for example - to help offload surplus energy instead of curtailing it. Start by predicting the maximum curtailable electricity per VRE in KWh at a given time and work backwards to figure out how many ASICs to include using the formula above. While the hashrate of Bitcoin has increased and the price has decreased in 2018, the price of a 14 TH\/S ASIC chip has dropped substantially to somewhere around $300-$400 and the price of the high end ASIC chips which get 28 TH\/S is around $1,000. There is a substantial amount of money to be made by using ASICs powered by VRE instead of curtailing the energy.","That said, there are serious regulatory and bureaucratic barriers to installing ASICs. At least in the U.S., nearly all VRE producers have agreements with the grid for it to pay producers for the curtailed electricity, but this compounds the problem and makes overall energy production even less efficient and more expensive for consumers. Additionally, the reliability of ASICs and the costs of procuring such a large number of them could be difficult as the technology continues to advance and the suppliers compete to hit the technological limit of chip manufacturing (currently around 7nm).","With properly integrated ASIC chips, VREs would become even more efficient and competitive compared to polluting energy sources, increasing the pace at which we transition global energy production to cleaner methods, decreasing the price of energy further for consumers, and further reducing our CO2 emissions.","&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
