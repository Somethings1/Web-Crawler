However, with Ethereum's scalability roadmap via rollups now in place, Olszewski sees it as an opportune moment for Celo to \"come home\" and continue its mission as part of a larger Ethereum scaling initiative.","\u201CWe saw this as a coming home moment, something the Celo community has been thinking about for a while that hadn\u2019t been possible until recent Layer 2 research developments such as EigenDA \u2014 the Ethereum aligned data availability protocol \u2014 making it possible for Celo to maintain its low gas fees as a Layer 2,\u201D Olszewski added.","cLabs, the a16z-backed core developer behind the Celo blockchain, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239838\/a16z-backed-clabs-submits-plan-for-celo-to-transition-into-ethereum-layer-2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposed<\/a> migrating its network from an independent Layer 1 to a Layer 2 built on Ethereum in July, leveraging Optimism's OP Stack. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252306\/polygon-celo-proposal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygon Labs<\/a> later proposed Celo could migrate to an Ethereum Layer 2 via the Polygon CDK in September, when zkSync developer <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.celo.org\/t\/matter-labs-proposal-for-celo-to-join-zk-nation-and-become-an-eth-l2-using-zk-stack\/6629\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Matter Labs<\/a> also proposed Celo became an Ethereum Layer 2 using its ZK Stack.","\u201CWhile cLabs\u2019 initial proposal sought to leverage OP Stack, the community has not yet decided on which stack to move forward with. In addition to OP Stack, the community is researching and evaluating a number of proposals that have been put forward by various projects, including Polygon Labs and Matter Labs,\u201D Olszewski said. \u201CcLabs aims to provide as much information as possible to help the community come to a decision soon. To do so, we\u2019re publishing a framework in the coming weeks to help make the most technically sound choice without compromising our community and ecosystem\u2019s needs.\u201D","As part of the \u201CCelo 2.0\u201D roadmap, cLabs plans to upgrade Celo to a highly scalable validium-based zk-EVM, Olszewski explained. But it also wants to maintain some unique feature set such as the ability to pay for transaction fees with ERC-20 tokens \u2014 made possible following advancements in next-generation zk-SNARK proving systems.","Celo is not the only one considering a transition to become an Ethereum Layer 2, with several blockchain projects, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/251566\/canto-to-migrate-into-a-zk-powered-layer-2-on-ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Canto<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/polygon.technology\/blog\/introducing-immutable-zkevm-powered-by-polygon-the-home-of-gaming-in-web3-in-partnership-with-immutable\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Immutable<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/250505\/astar-network-zkevm-ethereum-layer-2-polygon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Astar<\/a>, collaborating with Polygon Labs for their migration plans and exemplifying a growing trend in the space.","\u201CFor most EVM-compatible chains, it's increasingly hard to justify a standalone positioning in a market where the Ethereum scaling roadmap is proving itself,\u201D Olszewski argued.","\u201CPart of this is because developers are interested in building on Ethereum, and in the absence of scaling limits that previously sent them to other EVM-compatible Layer 1s, that means building on Layer 2s,\u201D he said. \u201CWe've seen some chains flirt with the idea of transitioning to a Layer 2 without truly committing to it. I think that will change as more projects get the courage to fully take the leap.\u201D","Influenced by Celo\u2019s mobile wallet origins, a mobile-first approach is core to the project \u2014 something it sees as vital in achieving mass adoption of blockchain technology.","\u201CAn estimated 6.9 billion people, or 86% of the world's population, own a smartphone, while access to desktop computers is far less widespread,\u201D Olszewski said. \u201CMobile phones allow everyday people to leapfrog technology \u2014 which is why making web3 more universally accessible to a mainstream audience requires building mobile-first experiences.\u201D","\u201CWhen we successfully transition to a Layer 2, our mobile-first approach, which we have implemented since genesis, will further help onboard users with access and efficiency in mind,\u201D he added.","Celo also aligns itself with the Regenerative Finance (ReFi) ecosystem \u2014 aiming to further sustainable and inclusive financial practices, with Olszewski describing Celo as the \u201Chome of ReFi.\u201D","The Celo co-founder said its \u201CUltragreen Money'' initiative demonstrated Celo's commitment to sustainability. This initiative builds on Ethereum\u2019s fee-burning mechanism to make the CELO token deflationary and send 20% of transaction fees to a new Carbon Offset Fund.","The ReFi ecosystem supports various projects, ranging from Universal Basic Income (UBI) distribution protocols like GoodDollar to environmental recovery efforts like Plastiks and accessible, low-cost financial tools such as MiniPay\u2019s ultralight stablecoin wallet, built by Opera in collaboration with the Celo Foundation, Olszewski added.","Â© 2023 The Block.
