The firm aims to not only provide cheap genomic sequencing \u2014 earlier this year it launched an at-home whole genome sequencing test that costs just $300 \u2014 but also to ensure that its customers\u2019 data is completely private.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The cost of so-called next-generation genetic sequencing has fallen dramatically in the past two decades. In 2007, famed biologist James Watson became the first person to have their genome sequenced for less than $1 million. Now, sequencing a whole genome can cost just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and cheap sequencing promises to usher in a new era in medicine in which healthcare can be tailored to individuals' unique genetic makeup.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But many patients have been reluctant to get sequenced. A major reason is that they don\u2019t trust personal genetics companies to keep their data private, according to Nebula CEO and co-founder Kamal Obbad. In recent years, firms like 23andMe and Ancestry.com have come under fire for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/dna-testing-ancestry-23andme-share-data-companies-2018-8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">selling their customers\u2019 genetic data to third parties<\/a>. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nebula, which was founded in 2016, has always been focused on differentiating itself with data privacy and security safeguards, contended Obbad. The company<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> already offers a service that lets customers get their genome sequenced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/you-can-soon-get-your-dna-sequenced-anonymously\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">without revealing their identity to the company<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. But since it launched, Nebula has had the goal of using blockchain technology to give users full ownership of their data.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Oasis's smart contract platform will give users fine-grained control over who has permission to access their data, and they will be able to share that information with genomic researchers while keeping it confidential, said Obbad. That\u2019s because all analyses of the data will occur within an isolated piece of hardware called a secure enclave, which is like a black box that keeps the information private from third parties \u2014 and from Nebula itself.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CNebula will never store your plaintext DNA,\u201D said Obbad. This protects not only the user but also the researcher, he said. \u201CNow they don\u2019t have to deal with all the regulatory overhead of dealing with identifying information.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nebula has scrapped <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/2018\/02\/07\/145768\/this-new-company-wants-to-sequence-your-genome-and-let-you-share-it-on-a-blockchain\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">early plans to launch a native token<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. But the company still aims to eventually enable cryptocurrency micropayments for users who may want to profit from their data, said Obbad.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the meantime, he thinks the privacy features that Nebula will be able to provide thanks to Oasis\u2019s platform will entice more people to get sequenced.&nbsp; \u201CI definitely think there are people out there who didn\u2019t want to do genetic testing and now will do genetic testing,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Interested users can participate in a <a href=\"https:\/\/nebula.org\/oasis-labs-partnership\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">beta program<\/a>, and the production version of the platform will be ready in the coming months. \"This product is effectively ready to roll out,\" said Obbad.<\/span>"],"hashtag":["SMART CONTRACTS"]}
