There is an economic evolution playing out for which the breadth of its impact and benefits have yet to be fully understood.","<a href=\"https:\/\/asiatechxsg.com\/speakers\/88573586-7a16-4156-8273-850cb5106dc9\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jihan Wu<\/a>, Matrixport\u2019s co-founder and chairman recently sat down with <a href=\"https:\/\/asiatechxsg.com\/speakers\/3ffe7ad4-c57c-4757-a952-f9ba38f83228\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vitalik Buterin<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/asiatechxsg.com\/speakers\/90f72e80-6eed-4710-8191-275935d9ea8f\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Balaji Srinivasan<\/a> at the <a href=\"https:\/\/asiatechxsg.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ATxSummit<\/a> and delved into the \u201CPotential Future and Pervasiveness of Blockchain\u201D.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Small Enterprises Stand to Benefit<\/strong>","We are in the early stages of a blockchain super-cycle that is disrupting the natural monopolies synonymous with the network effect of the digital economy. Many believe that we are now moving into the third era of the internet evolution known as the CBC (Client-Blockchain-Client) era, which combines the benefits of the P2P (open sourcing) and central hub (global state, scalability and monetisability) eras in a single data structure.","In the CBC era, the absence of centralised players should not be feared. Jihan Wu elaborates that blockchain will help small enterprises as a \u201Cmachine of trust,\u201D enabling them to compete with the giants by capturing the values created in the blockchain supply chain.","The blockchain disruption is on track to surpass the \u2018magic\u2019 of the internet-driven economy over the next decade. This presents significant potential for many national economies built upon small and medium enterprises, such as Germany and Indonesia, to leverage the benefits of blockchain for new value creation opportunities.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Time for Meaningful Purpose<\/strong>","There are key developments in the works to support the mass adoption of the blockchain-driven economy.","One example is the long awaited release of Ethereum 2.0, which will see a shift away from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in a bid to solve the environmental concerns associated with crypto-mining and to secure the network to a greater degree. It would also focus on improving efficiency and scalability, making it possible for more kinds of applications to be introduced.","As the technology becomes more sustainable and scalable, we expect blockchain to play a bigger role in shaping the economy of the future, where according to Jihan Wu, work and processes are optimised so that \u201Cpeople can spend more time on meaningful things.\u201D","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blockchain for Everyone<\/strong>","To accelerate the path towards unlocking the full potential of blockchain, blockchain literacy is one hurdle we need to overcome together.","In order to promote a deeper appreciation of the technology, Jihan Wu suggested encouraging the formation of small interest groups to drive awareness of the technology by sharing use cases and promoting collaboration and growth in the space.","By making blockchain and crypto easier for everyone, we can level the playing field and shape a decentralised economy - igniting a technological manifestation for the people, by the people.","Â© 2023 The Block.
