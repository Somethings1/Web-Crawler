This, in turn, boosts the total value locked in LRTs, with Etherfi holding a considerable portion of this value.","While Etherfi leads liquid restaking, other protocols also contribute hugely to the market. These include Renzo at $2.9 billion, Puffer at $1.4 billion, Kelp with over $840 million, Swell with $345 million, and Eigen at $340 million, according to The Block's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/restaking\/ethereum-liquid-restaking-total-value-locked\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data dashboard<\/a>.","Restaking allows users to employ their staked ETH \u2014 or a corresponding liquid staking token \u2014 on platforms like EigenLayer for restaking purposes. EigenLayer then allocates this ETH to support other Ethereum-based applications, termed \u201Cactively validated services\u201D, thereby broadening Ethereum\u2019s security framework.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/restaking\/ethereum-liquid-restaking-total-value-locked\/embed\" title=\"Ethereum Liquid Restaking Total Value Locked\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Liquid restaking offers the benefit of engaging with EigenLayer\u2019s services while maintaining liquidity and accessibility of users\u2019 ETH capital. These protocols continue to accept ether deposits, restake them, and issue derivative tokens, offering users additional incentives to participate in the ecosystem, which includes LRTs and EigenLayer\u2019s rewards programs.","LRT protocols also provide an alternative means for users who don\u2019t have 32 ETH (used for native or direct restaking) to access the platform.
