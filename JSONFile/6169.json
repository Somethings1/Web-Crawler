He also called for \"tailored and limited rights<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\" <\/strong>for stablecoin issuers to access basic Federal Reserve account services.&nbsp;","\"This would facilitate more timely satisfaction of redemption requirements, enhance financial stability, and protect consumers without providing access to the discount window or other financing programs afforded only to banks,\" he said, arguing that financial intermediaries for stablecoins should be required to hold them at qualified custodians that can include trust banks.","Finally, Allaire called for criminal penalties for companies that knowingly issue false digital dollars.&nbsp;","\"I believe civil penalties alone are woefully insufficient to dissuade those who will have tremendous economic incentives to flout US law and undermine the dollar\u2019s credibility at home and abroad,\" he said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
