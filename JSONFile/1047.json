But that would be a misunderstanding of how bitcoin miners and pools function work in practice.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin mining pools aggregate hashing power from any individual miners who want to connect to their service to mine blocks collectively. Although F2Pool is based in Beijing, that doesn\u2019t mean at all the miners connected to the pool are located there, too. In fact, they can come from anywhere in China or anywhere in the world.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wang also confirmed that they did not obtain internal statistics from any major mining pool about the exact geolocation of each of their miner customers.

For instance, China\u2019s share of the Bitcoin network's total mining capacity <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/102603\/bitcoin-hash-rate-xinjiang-miner-power\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has declined significantly<\/a> over the past 12 months.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Assumptions aside, the debate over the report's methodology does raise a question that is getting difficult to ignore as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies make their way into the mainstream: how can the energy mix of the bitcoin network be accurately measured?<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The reality is that the decentralized nature of bitcoin and bitcoin mining makes it incredibly difficult to quantify how much of the energy the network uses is sourced from renewables or not \u2014 let alone estimate the associated carbon dioxide emissions.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance made one of the most recent attempts to answer the question with its Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The CBECI estimates bitcoin\u2019s total energy consumption with a theoretical lower and upper bound between 35 and 391 terawatt-hours annually.

Further, the CBECI\u2019s mining map only captured the hash rate\u2019s geographic breakdown from September 2019 to April 2020, a period that\u2019s known as the dry season in China.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As the CBECI notes in a disclaimer: \u201CIn some countries, and China in particular, mining operations tend to move between locations according to seasonal variance in renewables production. These migration patterns can only be observed when selecting a longer timeframe for the analysis.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During the dry season, a significant number of miners in China\u2019s southwestern provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan migrate north to Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia, where the energy mix tends to be coal-based. Upon the return of the rainy season, which spans from May to September, some may return to the south, where there is a lot more hydropower in the mix.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">More accurate accounting would require year-long cooperation from enough major bitcoin mining pools to comprise a large majority of the hash rate. And it would need not only the IP geolocation of each mining machine \u2014 whether it\u2019s in Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia \u2014 but the exact model of each mining machine.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That\u2019s because bitcoin mining machines have evolved significantly over the past years, and several old models are still in use. For instance, to compute the same amount of hash rate, Bitmain\u2019s five-year-old AntMiner S9 consumes four times the amount of electricity used by the most efficient model on the market today, the AntMiner S19 Pro.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s next to impossible to know the exact composition of the machines in use, particularly during a bull market, when a large number of old models can still be used to turn a profit.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another theoretical approach \u2014 albeit an even longer shot \u2014 would be to convince energy authorities in different countries to identify how many bitcoin mining farms there are locally and how much energy they consume.<\/span>"],"hashtag":[]}
