Uniswap founder and CEO Hayden Adams said he wasn't surprised, but was \"annoyed, disappointed and ready to fight.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC has gone after other exchanges, though those were more centralized, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233270\/sec-sues-coinbase-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase<\/span><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263898\/sec-files-new-lawsuit-against-kraken-for-allegedly-operating-online-trading-platform-without-registering\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kraken<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233202\/details-of-the-sec-complaint-against-binance-include-ftx-like-misuse-of-customer-funds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance<\/span><\/a>.
