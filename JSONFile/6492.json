He underscored Ripple's \"quite successful confrontation\" with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/258581\/ripple-celebrates-dismissed-lawsuit-calling-it-a-surrender-by-the-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Securities and Exchange Commission<\/a>, and the company's involvement in global CBDC projects.","In mid-October, Ripple celebrated the dismissal of all charges against its executives in an ongoing lawsuit brought by the SEC. And, last week, the central bank of Georgia <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/261374\/georgias-central-bank-taps-ripple-for-digital-currency-pilot-project\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> a partnership with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/258581\/ripple-celebrates-dismissed-lawsuit-calling-it-a-surrender-by-the-sec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple<\/a> for the development of the country's central bank digital currency pilot project.","\"There is Ripple\u2019s aggressive marketing, big CBDC projects in cooperation with some governments, and also a very favorable bullish sentiment in the current crypto market, however, note that the price has not overcome the previous high in July,\" Lienkha added.","He said, however, that XRP's latest price movement was not exceptional, given the recent price surge of various altcoins, and added that the uptick in altcoins is \"a consequence of bitcoin growth, as other coins react with some delay.\"","According to analysts at CTF Capital, ether's recovery against BTC is a good sign for altcoins in general.","\"This could be a healthy sign of a cascade spillover down to other smaller assets as seen in past bull cycles. Moreover, it represents a broader positive sentiment on the asset class apart from the ETF approval narrative,\" CTF Capital said in an emailed note.","XRP was<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;changing hands for $0.71 at 1:40 p.m. in New York, according to <\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinGecko<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.
