But this act regulates crypto (or \"digital token\" in Singapore's context) firms that are located in Singapore and do business in the country. The regulator now wants to supervise entities that are based in Singapore and conduct business outside of the country.","\"Given the internet-based nature of such operations, there may be entities created in Singapore that do not perform such services in Singapore, but offer such services outside of Singapore and that are not captured under current legislation. MAS intends to regulate such entities for ML\/TF [money laundering\/terrorist financing] risks,\" the consultation paper reads. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThese entities could include any individual operating from a permanent place of business in Singapore; any corporation incorporated in Singapore; any partnership or limited liability partnership formed in Singapore.","Any entity that is \"not fit and proper\" to engage in regulated activities could be issued a prohibition order if the new act gets passed into law. MAS said this is similar to the approach taken in the U.K. and Australia.","\"In exercising this power, MAS will adopt a risk-proportionate approach, taking into account the nature, severity and impact of the misconduct,\" said the regulator. MAS has also proposed raising the maximum penalty for contravening technology risk requirements to SG$1 million (~$700,000).","The consultation paper is open for public comments until August 20.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSingapore is one of the most famous Asian countries for the crypto sector due to its regulatory-friendly environment.
