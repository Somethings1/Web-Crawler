The end result is that banks must choose to either custody digital assets thus inflating their balance sheet and severely affecting every other line of business or stay entirely out of the market.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">House lawmakers voted 31-20 to advance the measure, which would still need to go before the full House and eventually onto the Senate. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo, has also introduced a companion measure in the Senate.<\/span>","Lawmakers were anticipated to address SAB 121 in 2024, following <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/260282\/congressional-watchdog-says-sec-needs-lawmaker-approval-before-moving-forward-with-controversial-bulletin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an October statement<\/a> from the Government Accountability Office, which indicated that, by law, the bulletin must be reviewed by Congress before it can take effect.","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Flood also said SAB 121 could affect spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which were just approved by the SEC a month ago. Due to SAB 121, banks won't be able to be custodians for those ETFs, Flood said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"That's a situation where you might want more bank custodians who are well regulated experts on custody, on the job,\" Flood said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, top Democrat Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said the bulletin gave the crypto industry the clarity it has been asking for.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The crypto industry has long complained about the lack of clarity from the SEC when it comes to crypto and how the SEC supposedly only regulates crypto through enforcement rather than through regulation,\" Waters said on Thursday. <\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Notably this guidance was offered to protect investors against the mishandling of customer crypto assets by custodians \u2014 a practice that was at the core of FTX's spectacular collapse when billions of crypto assets went missing.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Waters also noted that if the resolution is signed into law, it could have a \"chilling effect\" on the SEC's ability to issue more guidance on any issue in the future.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The House Financial Services Committee also voted unanimously on Thursday to advance a bill that would clarify the U.S. Secret Service's authority over criminal activity involving digital assets.&nbsp;<\/span>","Introduced in January by Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis., and Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the bill named the Combating Money Laundering in Cyber Crime Act seeks to close what the sponsors describe as a gap that hinders the Secret Service's ability to investigate new types of \"criminal activity involving digital assets.\"","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
