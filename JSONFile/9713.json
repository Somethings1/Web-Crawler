The transaction fee was 19.89 bitcoin.&nbsp;","The wallet appeared in June and it\u2019s still making transactions, according to on-chain data.","The transaction fee went to Bitcoin mining pool F2Pool, which mined the block containing the transaction. Chun Wang, co-founder and administrator of F2Pool, said the 20 bitcoin will be put on hold for three days in case the originator wants to claim it. If unclaimed during that period, it will be paid to its pool of bitcoin miners.","Over its history, Bitcoin has seen a number of high-value transaction fees. For instance, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/blockchair.com\/bitcoin\/transactions?s=fee_usd(desc)#\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blockchair<\/a>, someone paid $134,000 as a fee during a transaction in 2016. In total, there have been 24 Bitcoin transaction fees exceeding $20,000 \u2014 and 233 transactions that have included fees above $10,000.","Bitcoin users can pay any amount they wish for transaction fees. If the transaction fee is too low, miners may not accept it and if it\u2019s very high, it will likely be processed immediately. Average transaction fees are <a href=\"https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">typically around<\/a> $1 or $2 but have risen as high as $60 during periods of high activity.","&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
