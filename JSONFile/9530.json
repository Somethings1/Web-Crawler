At that time, people familiar with the matter suggested the raise would value the project at $3 billion \u2014 as did its previous round \u2014 but no valuation was disclosed in today\u2019s announcement.","The San Francisco-based Tools for Humanity was co-founded by Alex Blania, Max Novendstern and Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Its purpose is to drive forwards the Worldcoin project \u2014 an audacious attempt to create a cryptocurrency that is global in scope and available to anyone who has verified they are a real person. The main method of doing that is to get scanned by one of Worldcoin\u2019s orbs.","The project is building toward the launch of the Worldcoin token, which company representatives have repeatedly earmarked for the first half of this year.","The cash injection will be used to further develop the recently launched World App, a wallet dedicated to the Worldcoin ecosystem, as well as for continued R&amp;D and growth, according to the announcement.","In addition to Blockchain Capital \u2014 an American crypto investment firm with some $2 billion under management \u2014&nbsp;a16z crypto, Bain Capital Crypto and Distributed Global also participated in the round.","\u201CAs we embark on the age of AI, it is imperative that individuals are able to maintain personal privacy while proving their humanness. In doing so we can help ensure that everyone can realize the financial benefits that AI is poised to deliver,\u201D said Alex Blania, CEO and co-founder of Tools for Humanity, in a statement.","According to Worldcoin\u2019s website, 1.7 million people \u2014 the majority of them in the Global South \u2014 have already had their identities verified and are ready to claim their share of the token when it launches.","The project has proven controversial since drawing sharp criticism from privacy advocates when it was first unveiled. More recently, its developers were forced to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231433\/worldcoin-iris-black-market\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">roll out fresh measures<\/a> to combat the beginnings of a black market for Worldcoin credentials.","Yet momentum continues to build. The Block revealed in March that Worldcoin had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/220402\/worldcoin-outsourcing-deal-jabil-iris-scanning-orbs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">struck a deal<\/a> with manufacturing giant Jabil to ramp up production of its iris-scanning orbs. With the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229742\/sam-altman-worldcoin-app-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">World App launching<\/a> in May and fresh capital to hand, everything seems poised for the token to go live.","Â© 2023 The Block.
