That\u2019ll put Wisdomtree on a course to competing with crypto startups including MetaMask and Strike, neobanks such as Chime and traditional consumer banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CTwo hundred million people use crypto today. These are the early adopters,\u201D Guthrie said. \u201CI really care not about the 200 million that are in but the next 2 billion that come on \u2014 and how we help them connect to, and use, and benefit from this space.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Guthrie sees blockchain technology as a great tool to reduce the frictions and costs resulting from the myriad middlemen involved in financial transactions. Still, he says the end-user experience of most crypto wallets is far too complicated for the average person at the moment.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">WisdomTree \u2014 which manages about $75 billion \u2014 sees an opening in the market between self-custody crypto wallets, which require a certain technical ability to operate, and the centralized accounts offered by crypto exchanges like Binance and FTX.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere's a big gap in terms of what's out there at the moment that enables people to come into this space,\u201D Guthrie said. Self-custody wallets like Ledger are \u201Cfine if you're really into the technology and you're an early adopter or you're very computer savvy or literate. But that's not really a viable user experience for mainstream.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Guthrie has huge ambitions for WisdomTree Prime, seeing it as an app that can \u201Csit at the center of somebody's financial life.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Users will be able to deposit their paychecks, connect a debit card for day-to-day spending, invest in a selection of tokenized assets \u2013 and, over time, integrate with innovations happening in decentralized finance (DeFi).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At least initially, all assets in the wallet will be WisdomTree\u2019s tokenized versions. So users\u2019 dollars will be stored as WisdomTree tokenized dollars and any investments \u2014 such as bitcoin \u2014 will also be WisdomTree\u2019s tokenized version.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Guthrie said the app\u2019s initial offering should include versions of the dollar, US government bonds, gold, bitcoin and ether. He hopes to eventually add extra investing choices, such as tokenized stock market indexes.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">WisdomTree, which has separately been <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/138680\/sec-punts-on-wisdomtree-one-river-spot-bitcoin-etf-proposals\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">seeking to launch<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> a spot bitcoin ETF in the US, has some tools to compete in the cutthroat market for crypto wallets. For one, it has years of experience adapting investments so they can trade on other venues, including converting gold into a gold ETF. It also has a brand that\u2019s familiar to more maintream investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The app\u2019s pitch is to allow users all the functionality of traditional banking and investment \u2014 getting your salary paid, transferring money to friends, saving for retirement \u2014 while discarding the decades-old technology of the traditional financial system.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe can make this experience manageable, feel like what they've got, but be attached and natively built on this new set of technology,\u201D Guthrie said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While WisdomTree will ramp up marketing as next year\u2019s full launch approaches, it\u2019s not planning to splurge on the types of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/99134\/report-ftx-miami-heat-stadium-vote\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">eye-catching<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> stunts employed by some consumer-focused crypto brands.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf you've got a very good product that has a compelling value proposition you can attract clients without naming a stadium or hiring Matt Damon,\u201D Guthrie said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, he sees the public nature of blockchains as a potential challenge to their wider adoption in consumer finance. Because transactions happen in full view, some users might be concerned about acquaintances learning their wallet address \u2014 although crypto mixing tools might help avoid this.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As Guthrie puts it, \u201CI want to send you 10 bucks to pay for beers last night. I don't necessarily need you to be able to then go and see my whole bank account.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Overall though, Guthrie is bullish on the potential for crypto to disrupt financial services.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI don't think financial services had its \u2018internet moment,\u2019\u201D he concludes. \u201CPeople fill out forms online, but they're nominally the same as what they did in-branch 20 years ago. The experience and the business model is fundamentally the same. And I think that is ripe for disruption.\"<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
