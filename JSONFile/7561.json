However, the CeFi - DeFi difference was never as evident as during the last blow when numerous CeFi entities were caught off-guard by margin calls. One of the biggest crypto companies has even filed for bankruptcy. Things in DeFi have remained more or less stable as global deleveraging occurred. The code and design of DeFi protocols forced borrowers to pay back their loans or face imminent and automatic liquidation. DeFi loans CeFi entities had to pay back no matter what. That\u2019s what DeFi is all about.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:192,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2018 a market crash birthed the idea of creating a DeFi product that would enable users to pay back their loans easily, and, if possible - automatically, without the risk of liquidation. Why wouldn\u2019t it be possible if DeFi is based on smart contract composability, with DeFi protocols and apps able to interact with one another in a permissionless way?&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:192,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The idea was to create a DeFi service that would allow people to step back from their computers and sleep peacefully or go on a vacation without worrying if they would get liquidated during big market crashes or due to the ever-present volatility in the crypto space.

Users input their desired collateral and debt ratio, and Automation will automatically monitor the positions and make necessary adjustments, depending on the market conditions. It will increase or decrease leverage depending on the price of the underlying collateral, increasing user exposure in favorable market conditions or preventing liquidation and loss of funds in the opposite direction. Automation will either sell part of the collateral to pay off the debt or will borrow and acquire more of the supplied asset, increasing the leverage based on the provided ratio.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:192,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Following the famous DeFi summer of 2020, the team introduced it for Compound and Aave protocols. This year, DeFi Saver went beyond the ratio-based liquidation protection and introduced the first Stop Loss and Take Profit automated strategies for Maker and Liquity based on price triggers. The new modular trigger-based architecture allows for the creation of even more advanced strategies, which are on the roadmap.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:192,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The app went live in 2019 when network congestion on Ethereum wasn't an issue. Yet, with the growing number of users, Ethereum gas fees made the Automation feature inaccessible for many retail users, something the team has wanted to address for a long time. High transaction gas fees led them to introduce a minimum debt requirement for the service to protect the users and the system from extremely high gas prices and transaction costs, especially during big market crashes.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:192,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/defisaver.com\/?mtm_campaign=theblock_2nd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DeFi Saver<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> launched their app over a month ago on Layer 2 optimistic rollup networks Arbitrum and Optimism, initially bringing the app's advanced set of features to Aave v3 protocol with more protocols integrations in store.

Automation is no longer available only for sizable positions, making it more accessible to the general audience. Users can now automate Aave v3 positions with just $500 of debt.
