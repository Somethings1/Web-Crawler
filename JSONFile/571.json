Introduced in 2020, the program rewarded users for their activity on the platform, such as receiving significant upvotes on comments or posts. The points earned were Ethereum-compatible ERC-20 tokens stored in Reddit's crypto wallet, Reddit Vault, which could be spent on perks like emojis or badges. However, to address scalability issues and reduce transaction costs, the service <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162299\/reddits-community-points-are-migrating-to-arbitrum-nova\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">migrated<\/a> from Ethereum to Layer 2 Arbitrum Nova in August 2022.","The price of moons tokens surged 240% from $0.05 to $0.17 following the update before consolidating, according to CoinGecko data.
