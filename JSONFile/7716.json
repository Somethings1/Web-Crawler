The layoffs are the latest to hit the cryptocurrency industry, as other firms have let staff go amid a challenging business environment.","Analytic firms Chainalysis, Elliptic, and CipherTrace<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/61411\/blockchain-analytics-chainalysis-elliptic-ciphertrace-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> have either laid off staff or cut salaries<\/a> because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as The Block reported late last week.","A representative for BitGo confirmed the layoffs when reached for comment, telling The Block:","\"BitGo's evolution to become a digital asset financial services firm for the institutional market has accelerated with two acquisitions in the last quarter. As we move into new markets with new products and services, we are making changes to strengthen the business and reorganize our teams. We have made the difficult decision to let go of a small number of people totaling 12% of our workforce. It is never easy to make a decision like this and we have deep gratitude for the contributions and talent of those affected.\"","The layoffs at BitGo follow news yesterday that the firm acquired tax management platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/62099\/crypto-custodian-bitgo-acquires-portfolio-management-platform-lumina\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lumina<\/a>.
