This includes partner projects such as Jupiter, Solflare, Zeta Markets, Banana Gun and Birdeye that have integrated the deBridge protocol within their applications.","\u201CThe program rewards past loyalty through multiples on past and future activity while encouraging and incentivizing new users to experience deBridge\u2019s near-instant settlement, deep liquidity and tight spreads on native bridge transfers,\u201D the team added.","deBridge points are designed as part of a growth initiative, intending to decentralize governance power to the community as it moves toward launching the deBridge token.","The launch of deBridge\u2019s native token is set to follow the first season of points. However, the project did not disclose the specific criteria for the program, a date for the proposed token launch, nor how the accumulation of points would convert to any token allocation when asked by The Block.","In February, Solana decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter put forward three \u201COG\u201D Solana projects to potentially become the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/276741\/jupiter-lfg-launchpad-token-candidates\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">next tokens<\/a> to launch on its new LFG launchpad \u2014 of which deBridge was highlighted as one of the candidates.","While the specific details are yet to be announced, the deBridge token could launch on Jupiter\u2019s LFG platform upon the conclusion of the points program\u2019s first season.
