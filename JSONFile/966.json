Immutable X currently provides fast and cheap transactions for gaming apps but lacks native compatibility with the Ethereum blockchain.","Immutable claims games, including Guild of Guardians, Metalcore, Shardbound, Treeverse, Cool Cats, BADMAD Robots, Space Nation, Eyeball Games and Imaginary Ones, are committed to being the first to launch on Immutable zkEVM.","\u201CThis is a chain built exclusively for gamers and gaming studios, and every step of the way, our development team made sure to implement any and all aspects a targeted gaming audience could ask for,\u201D Immutable co-founder Robbie Ferguson said in a statement. \u201COver the last 12 months, over 200 games have committed to building on Immutable, bringing our market share close to 70%. 2024 is going to be the year a large number of these games go live, and we\u2019ll see tens of millions of players adopt the next gaming experience.\u201C","Immutable\u2019s current products will also be compatible with Immutable zkEVM, and the chain will offer gas-free functionality for gamers who use its Immutable Passport non-custodial wallet, according to the project.","The Immutable zkEVM mainnet is set to open up to the public in the coming weeks.","Immutable isn\u2019t the only zkEVM powered by Polygon, with Polygon Labs recently helping develop zkEVM chains for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/250505\/astar-network-zkevm-ethereum-layer-2-polygon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Astar Network<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238140\/idex-unveils-a-zkevm-layer-2-chain-based-on-polygon-supernets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IDEX<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241693\/palm-network-polygon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Palm Network<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/256348\/manta-pacific-migration-optimism-polygon-zkevm-ethereum-layer-2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Manta Pacific<\/a>."],"hashtag":["GAME","POLYGON","ZKEVM"]}
