The first phase of the proposed Astra upgrade revamps the relationship between the primary Avalanche network and its subnets. Prior to this upgrade, subnet validators were required to validate not only the primary network \u2014 comprising the Exchange Chain (X-Chain)\u200B, Platform Chain (P-Chain) and Contract Chain (C-Chain)\u200B \u2014 but also any additional subnets of interest.","With the upgrade in place, subnet validators will focus exclusively on running a subnet and synchronizing its P-Chain. This narrowed focus results in reduced computational and hardware demands, thereby lowering entry costs. The upgrade essentially eliminates the need for subnet validators to also serve as primary network validators. The P-Chain's function is to allow validators to stake AVAX and receive rewards.","\u201CWithout the requirement to validate the Primary Network, the need for Subnet Validators to initialize and synchronize the C-Chain and X-Chain can be relaxed. Subnet Validators will only be required to sync the P-Chain to track any validator set changes in their subnet and to support Cross-Subnet communication,\u201D O\u2019Grady stated.","The Avalanche network boasts multiple subnets designed for a range of applications. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/164497\/defi-kingdoms-to-leave-harmony-for-metaverse-focused-blockchain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DeFi Kingdom<\/a> and Shrapnel subnets cater to the play-to-earn gaming space. Projects like Dexalot and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.avax.network\/blog\/meld-leverages-avalanches-subnet-technology-to-enhance-its-defi-offerings\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meld<\/a> operate subnets that focus on decentralized finance. There are also specialized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/225210\/avalanche-unveils-evergreen-subnets-targeted-at-enterprise-clients\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Evergreen subnets<\/a> targeted at enterprise clients in the financial services industry.","A subsequent phase will transition the subnet validation model from one based on staking to a rent-based system. Instead of the previous 2,000 AVAX ($22,000) staking requirement, a new \u201Cpay-as-you-go\u201D validation fee in AVAX will be imposed. This fee is adjustable, varying depending on the number of validators in a specific subnet. This change introduces a dynamically priced, continuously charged mechanism, eliminating the need to lock or stake large sums of AVAX upfront.","The Astra upgrade is not the first initiative by Ava Labs to enhance its subnets\u2019 capabilities. Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/197476\/avalanche-upgrade-banff-5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Banff upgrade<\/a> introduced features like Elastic Subnets and Avalanche Warp Messaging. The Astra Upgrade aims to build on these earlier advancements, further refining the network\u2019s adaptability and functionality.","Avalanche\u2019s Astra upgrade, according to Ava Labs, may help bring subnets to an broader market of both crypto native and traditional businesses building on-chain products and services into its ecosystem.","Â© 2023 The Block.
