The perpetual futures exchange has been in \u201Calpha\u201D mode ever since, but has now switched to beta mode, in which testers of the technology will be added in phases before a full public beta launch later, according to an announcement today.","Ankex describes itself as a \u201Chybrid\u201D player in the crypto exchange landscape, giving users a way to trade directly from self-custodial wallets, with the help of Qredo\u2019s software.","Michael Moro, who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/164014\/genesis-ceo-michael-moro-steps-down-from-role-effective-immediately\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stepped down as CEO of Genesis Global Capital<\/a> in August last year after the group\u2019s loans to failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital soured, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/224765\/former-genesis-ceo-cryptocurency-derivatives-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">joined Ankex as CEO in April<\/a>. The lending unit of Genesis <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/crypto-lending-unit-genesis-files-us-bankruptcy-2023-01-20\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. in January<\/a>.","Moro said in an interview that he wanted his next career move \u201Cto be a response\u201D that would help move the crypto industry forward. He then met executives from Qredo at the CfC conference in St. Moritz, Switzerland earlier this year and discussed a potential move to Ankex.","\u201CIt was a lightbulb moment for me,\u201D Moro said. \u201CThis is something that is trying to solve the FTX problem, or rather the CeFi problem.\u201D","He continued: \u201CIf exchanges are non-custodial and everything is on-chain, then you stop asking questions about proof of reserves, because you\u2019re able to check everything for yourself.\u201D","Moro also believes the Ankex team has created what he described as a \u201Cbankruptcy-remote structure,\u201D in which the collateral put up by futures traders stays locked in Qredo wallets, meaning, in theory, that it couldn\u2019t end up locked on the exchange if it were to run into difficulty. &nbsp;","The platform is specifically built for high-frequency traders and initially offers the ability to settle trades in USDC, the stablecoin, according to the announcement.","To date, the business has been funded by Qredo, but it is currently seeking external capital in the form of a seed-stage investment, Moro said. While initially users will need to open a Qredo wallet to begin trading on Ankex, ultimately the goal is that it becomes&nbsp;\u201Cwallet agnostic,\u201D he added.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
