A ZK-proof is a cryptographic tool that can be used to create ZK-rollups. ZK-rollups enable transactions to be processed but don\u2019t require all transaction data to be posted on Ethereum. This helps to reduce the block space used on Ethereum \u2014 enabling it to scale \u2014 and reduces gas fees.","The deal follows Polygon's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/114479\/polygon-hermez-merger-matic-hez-tokens-ethereum-projects\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acquiring of Hermez Network<\/a> for $250 million in August.","Polygon says Mir Protocol possesses the fastest ZK-proof technology, meaning it can generate proofs faster and verify more transactions in a single proof. The Mir team has invested a lot of time designing and optimizing their ZK-proof technology called Plonky2, Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic told The Block.","\"It is a great piece of engineering,\" he said. \"Plonky2 can generate recursive proofs in an incredible 170 milliseconds on a laptop. Most importantly, plonky2 is practical to use on Ethereum, with 45kb proofs in size-optimized mode.\"","Mir was founded by Brendan Farmer and Daniel Lubarov two years ago. Along with eight other colleagues, they are both joining the Polygon team as part of the deal, said Bjelic.","Polygon and Mir reached the deal on November 26. It involves 190 million MATIC tokens and $100 million worth of USDC stablecoins, totaling around $400 million as of MATIC's price on November 26, said Bjelic.","The deal carries a vesting period of three years, meaning the Mir team will be able to withdraw the funds over a period of three years based on deliverables, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal told The Block.","As part of the deal, Mir is rebranding to Polygon Zero, and the project will build a ZK-rollup based on its ZK-proof technology.","Bjelic said the Polygon Zero ZK-rollup should be ready sometime next year. As for the expected zkEVM launch by the Polygon Hermez team, Bjelic said that should happen by mid-next year.","There are currently several ZK-rollup-based Ethereum scaling technologies live in the market with limited functionalities, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/124479\/ethereum-layer-2-developer-starkware-raises-50-million-now-valued-at-2-billion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">StarkWare<\/a>'s StarkEx, Loopring, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/123617\/ethereum-layer-2-scaling-solution-developer-matter-labs-raises-50-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Matter Labs<\/a>' zkSync.
