He is suspected of involvement in concealing criminal financial flows and facilitating money laundering through the mixing service Tornado Cash, which allows users to obscure blockchain-based transactions. A spokesperson for FIOD declined to comment on the suspect's identity when contacted by The Block.&nbsp;","\"These advanced technologies, such as decentralised organisations that may facilitate money laundering are receiving extra attention from the FIOD,\" the agency said, adding that it may make further arrests.&nbsp;","The agency also claimed that the people behind the organization \u2014 not specifying if that's the developers who coded it or members of the DAO that runs it \u2014 made large-scale profits from these transactions.","The US Treasury added Tornado Cash and 44 associated Ethereum and USDC wallets to its Specially Designated Nationals list, according to an August 8 announcement from the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control. The wallets identified included the smart contract that runs Tornado Cash and the Tornado Cash donation wallet.","Following the sanctions, deposits to the protocol have drastically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163019\/tornado-cash-hit-by-79-decline-in-deposits-as-users-rush-for-the-exit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">slowed down<\/a> and there has been a big surge in withdrawals.
