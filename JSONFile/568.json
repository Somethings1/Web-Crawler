She checked with Bankman-Fried before speaking to employees. She checked with Bankman-Fried before tweeting. She checked with Bankman-Fried before sending Alameda\u2019s balance sheet to investors&nbsp;\u2014 and asked which of her seven drafts he liked best.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Now, all Bankman-Fried can do is watch as his ex-coworker \u2014&nbsp;and ex-girlfriend \u2014 testifies against him at his trial on seven counts of fraud. Ellison, who pleaded guilty to seven counts of her own last December, is cooperating with the government, helping to put Bankman-Fried away in the hope of receiving a shorter sentence.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Over the course of their direct examination, which concluded on Wednesday, government prosecutors led Ellison through questions with the apparent goal of establishing two main points: that Ellison\u2019s Alameda frequently borrowed funds from FTX customers, and that it did so with Bankman-Fried\u2019s implicit approval \u2014 or at his explicit direction, such as when Alameda borrowed billions of customer funds using its line of credit on FTX in order to repay its lenders in May 2022.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI thought it was wrong,\u201D Ellison testified. So why did she authorize the payments anyway? \u201CBecause Sam told me to.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On the stand, Ellison readily admitted to her own corruption, describing how she sent misleading balance sheets to investors, lied to employees and to the public about Alameda\u2019s unsavory behavior, and rubber-stamped more and more borrowing, even as she knew it undermined Alameda\u2019s financial stability.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A major turning point for Ellison came in the spring of 2022, following the crypto market downturn spurred by the collapse of Terra (and perhaps, for the superstitious, Ellison\u2019s declaration <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255798\/inside-the-trial-caroline-ellison-dishes-on-sbfs-unyielding-hunger-for-capital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hours earlier<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, \u201CI think things are going better\u201D). As crypto prices crashed, Alameda\u2019s lenders asked for billions of dollars back \u2014 Alameda\u2019s loans were mostly open-term, meaning they could be called at any time.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yet Alameda didn\u2019t have the cash on hand, according to an analysis Ellison said she shared with Bankman-Fried. After reviewing the document, however, Bankman-Fried continued to direct Ellison to repay the loans, she testified. How? \u201CI understood that he was telling me to use FTX customer funds to repay our loans,\u201D she said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Though Bankman-Fried made the decision, Ellison testified that she directed Alameda\u2019s settlements team to handle the payments. What followed, Ellison testified, was \u201Ca constant state of dread\u201D as she worried about the risk Alameda\u2019s borrowing posed to FTX\u2019s customers.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To make matters worse, Genesis, one of Alameda\u2019s lenders, requested a balance sheet from Ellison on June 18, 2022. Ellison and Bankman-Fried agreed that a balance sheet that clearly disclosed Alameda\u2019s borrowing \u2014 Ellison estimated it at $10 billion owed to FTX and $5 billion in loans to executives \u2014 looked too bad to send.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ellison came up with seven alternative ways to display the data; the one Bankman-Fried chose, Ellison testified, simply canceled out those two values \u2014 despite the illiquid nature of the loans, which were mostly used to fund venture investments. Ellison concealed the remaining balance, around $5 billion in borrowed customer deposits, in the long-term loan category of the balance sheet. (As the bank run on FTX would later show, customer deposits did not actually resemble long-term loans.)&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ellison said that she knew sending the misleading balance sheet to Genesis was wrong. \u201CI did consider it to be dishonest,\u201D she testified.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bankman-Fried could only watch from his chair as Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon read one of his Tweets from the same period: \u201CBackstopping customer funds should always be primary. Everything else is secondary.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite her hopes that the crypto market would recover or that Bankman-Fried would be able to secure additional financing from FTX, perhaps from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who Ellison said Bankman-Fried was courting, the scenario Ellison had feared for months would soon arrive.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yet Ellison, appearing to choke up while testifying for the only time, described feeling mixed emotions as Alameda and FTX collapsed around her. \u201CI felt a sense of relief that I didn't have to lie anymore, that I could start taking responsibility and being honest about what I had done, even though I obviously felt indescribably bad about all of the people that were harmed and the people that lost their money, the employees that lost their jobs, people that trusted us that we had betrayed,\u201D Ellison testified.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bankman-Fried believed in \u201Ca very proactive approach\u201D to PR, Ellison testified. He had a particular attachment to his hair. \"He said ever since Jane Street, he thought he had gotten higher bonuses because of his hair and that it was an important part of FTX's narrative and image,\u201D Ellison testified.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After first moving to the Bahamas, the two of them were assigned luxury cars, Ellison testified. Bankman-Fried suggested they switch: a Toyota Corolla for him, and a Honda Civic for her. When a Bloomberg reporter asked questions about FTX\u2019s relationship with Alameda, she tried to match what she had heard him say in the past \u2014&nbsp;after checking with Bankman-Fried whether she should give a comment at all.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ellison was also asked about Bankman-Fried\u2019s media investments, with specific questions regarding <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/193753\/the-block-ceo-resigns-after-failure-to-disclose-loans-from-bankman-frieds-alameda\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the investments he made in this publication<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. Ellison testified that Bankman-Fried told her \u201C...he thought [The Block] was the best crypto news organization, and I think he said that they were in some amount of financial trouble and he wanted to support them so they could continue their reporting.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Asked by Sassoon if Bankman-Fried said anything about the \u201Ceffect he intended for his investments,\u201D Ellison said, \"I don't recall anything beyond him saying that he wanted to support The Block.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Over the course of Ellison\u2019s direct examination, the prosecution\u2019s implicit argument became clear: Ellison wasn\u2019t corrupt by chance; rather, she was <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">corrupted<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> by Bankman-Fried. At every possible moment, guided by the prosecution\u2019s deft questioning, Ellison emphasized how she acted at Bankman-Fried\u2019s direction \u2014&nbsp;especially when doing things she knew were wrong. Her performance on the stand helped sell the point to several members of the public who showed up to observe the trial.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CShe was prepped really well. At every single point possible, she kept on saying \u2018and we took customer funds.\u2019 She kept on saying \u2018I was directed by Sam,\u2019\u201D one observer told me as another nodded in agreement. \u201CShe\u2019s very rehearsed, she knows her stuff.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bankman-Fried seemed to have a particularly strong reaction to Ellison\u2019s testimony. At one point, Sassoon even called a sidebar meeting with the judge to complain about Bankman-Fried\u2019s behavior.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI've noticed several times since the lunch break that in response to things the witness has said, the defendant has laughed, visibly shaken his head, and scoffed,\u201D Sassoon said. \u201CIt's possible it's having a visible effect on her, especially given the history of this relationship, the prior attempts to intimidate her, the power dynamic, their romantic relationship, and I would ask that defense counsel tell him to control his visible reaction to her testimony.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Defense attorney Mark Cohen, after calling the complaint \u201Cridiculous\u201D and pointing out that Ellison had trouble even identifying Bankman-Fried in court yesterday, conceded that he\u2019d talk to his client during the break about his behavior.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block will be back in court tomorrow for Caroline Ellison\u2019s cross-examination by the defense.&nbsp;<\/span>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","© 2023 The Block.
