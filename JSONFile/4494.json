Launched in 2021, it's the third chain the game has called home. But while Serendale has now moved house, the Crystalvale realm will remain on DFK Chain, an Avalanche subnet.","Since it went live yesterday, the Klaytn-based part of the game has been accessed by over 4,200 unique wallets, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/dappradar.com\/multichain\/games\/defi-kingdoms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DappRadar<\/a>.&nbsp;","By contrast, activity on Harmony-Serendale has wound down over the last few months.","Earlier in the year, Harmony experienced a major hack on its Horizon Bridge in which criminals made off with nearly $100 million in ETH. In addition, the DFK team reported ongoing difficulties working with Harmony.&nbsp;","","","Klaytn hopes the partnership with DeFi Kingdoms will help it reinforce its global presence and liquidity.
