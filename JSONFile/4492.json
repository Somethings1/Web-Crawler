This trading desk is one-half of the company\u2019s service called Heybit while the other half is a global exchange-traded funds platform called Iruda.","Under Heybit, Uprise took custodied crypto assets from customers and traded them in the cryptocurrency futures market. Uprise\u2019s AI-enabled trading technology was supposed to minimize the risk associated with leveraged crypto trading.","However, the system could not prevent the firm from being liquidated out of its LUNA futures trading position and losing 26.7 billion won ($20 million) in the process. This happened during Luna's price crash. It was reportedly shorting Luna \u2014 while its price plummeted \u2014 but got caught out during sudden price pumps along the way.","The lost funds represent about 99% of the funds that Uprise was managing on behalf of its customers. These clients are high-net-worth individuals and corporate entities, according to the report. Uprise also reportedly lost $3 million of its own funds short trading LUNA.","Uprise is reportedly considering some form of compensation for affected customers. \u201CIt is true that damage to customer assets has occurred due to unexpected great volatility in the market. We plan to finalize the report on [the] virtual asset business soon,\u201D said a spokesperson for the company, according to Seoul Economic daily.","Korean venture capital giant Kakao Ventures and major Korean commercial lender Hana Bank are among some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smarttimes.co.kr\/news\/articleView.html?idxno=2165\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">backers<\/a> of Uprise.
