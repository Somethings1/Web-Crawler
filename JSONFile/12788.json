This will enable a more diverse set of implementations of the scaling solution, potentially bolstering security and decentralization.","Papyrus will improve the project\u2019s transaction throughput capabilities, the team <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/starkware\/papyrus-an-open-source-starknet-full-node-396f7cd90202\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> on Wednesday. It joins Pathfinder as the second Rust-coded full-node client. StarkNet also has another full-node client called Juno that is being coded in Golang.&nbsp;","The newly released node will help expand StarkNet\u2019s performance and decentralization, the announcement stated. Papyrus will reportedly enhance the StarkNet Sequencer\u2019s block production capabilities. The Sequencer is the tool responsible for ordering and executing transactions on StarkNet. Papyrus will provide an efficient storage layer to help improve the Sequencer\u2019s throughput.","StarkWare has previously outlined its growth map for StarkNet with a focus on functionality, scalability, and decentralization in that order. The team says it has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175800\/an-ethereum-team-has-warped-uniswap-onto-starknet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">achieved excellent functionality<\/a> with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/196442\/visa-proposes-using-starknet-for-automatic-recurring-payments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Visa recently proposing<\/a> to use StarkNet for recurring payments. Now, attention is moving to system performance concerns with the aim of improving scalability, hence the rollout of Papyrus.","The introduction of Papyrus will also help the push toward greater decentralization, the team stated, as it is an open-source node client. This move is part of efforts to open-source the project\u2019s wider technology stack.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
