In a world of nearly countless different pools, numerous chains, and unique risk profiles, choosing the right yield farming strategy can be strenuous.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Of the many different challenges that come with earning yield in DeFi many investors are often left asking one question: Are these yields sustainable?&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">We\u2019ve all seen it, a pool offering great yields. Then, either suddenly or over the course of a few weeks, the rate of return drastically declines. This is because many yield-farming opportunities face dilution. Where, when more investors enter the pool the shared yield declines in value.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This then begs the question, how do I know if my yield will be diluted?&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen yield farming solutions like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mero.finance\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mero<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> start to flourish. The Mero protocol was first deployed on Ethereum mainnet during mid-March of 2022. Since then, its yield-aggregating liquidity pools have proven to be top performers and, on many occasions, have generated some of the highest base APYs on Ethereum. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One of the key factors that has kept liquidity providers on Mero is their underlying strategy design which generates yield solely through blue chip DeFi protocols such as Curve and Convex. For instance, the USDC pool (which is currently Mero\u2019s most popular pool) generates yield by deploying funds to a Curve pool which consistently has over $100m in TVL! Meaning, in order for the current APY, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/yields\/pool\/9078aa8f-7378-4969-925e-567e0c9b8da9\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">which is 8.64%<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, to be significantly diluted, the Mero USDC pool would have to grow exponentially in TVL. This room for growth, or resistance from dilution, enables more sustainable rates of returns for liquidity providers and less exposure to volatility.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Another reason yield farmers choose Mero is that it offers customizable market triggers that they can set to their provided liquidity. Meaning, while their assets stay on Mero earning yield, the Mero protocol will monitor their external positions and shift their liquidity if needed. These customizable market triggers, called Actions, can be set by anyone who provides liquidity on Mero. As of now, Mero supports Actions for collateral top-ups and debt repayments. Both of which have been utilized by borrowers to hedge risk and increase leverage while simultaneously farming yield.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While Mero pools have been steadily generating yield for about a year, it should be noted that there\u2019s still much to come, as it has been sometimes hinted at on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/merofinance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.
