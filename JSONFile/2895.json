In a statement, Sun stated, \u201CExcited to assist Curve! As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed. Our joint efforts will introduce an stUSDT pool on Curve, amplifying user benefits. Together, we aim to empower the community and forge a decentralized finance.\"","Notably, stUSDT is described as the \u201Cfirst real-world asset protocol on the Tron Network.\u201D&nbsp;","This comes amid turbulence in the CRV market. It's value hit the $0.50 mark earlier today, a low point since November of the prior year, before rebounding to $0.59. At the same time, open interest in CRV-linked perpetual futures grew to over <a href=\"https:\/\/coinalyze.net\/curve-dao-token\/open-interest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$124 million<\/a>, according to Coinalyze data.

Amid sharp volatility, Egorov made several key <a href=\"https:\/\/debank.com\/profile\/0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428\/history?token=\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">transfers<\/a>. He repaid a noteworthy 5.13 million FRAX stablecoin loan and reclaimed 12.5 million CRV tokens as collateral. Observers also highlighted on-chain data showing that Egorov moved 12.5 million CRV from Fraxlend to a fresh wallet.","Before this action, Egorov had received USDT stablecoin from anonymous wallets, fueling <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/etheraltog\/status\/1686262939236364288?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">speculation<\/a>&nbsp;from crypto commentators about potential OTC deals or transactions off the main platform.","Â© 2023 The Block.
