After three months of chasing basketball great Shaquille O\u2019Neal, lawyers handling a class action lawsuit served the basketball star and one-time FTX promoter outside his Atlanta home on Sunday.","O\u2019Neal is among more than a dozen celebrities and sports teams who are being sued for promoting FTX, the now-bankrupt crypto exchange. He had at one point been so supportive of FTX that the company dubbed him \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FTX_Official\/status\/1532119977381208066?lang=en\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Shaqtoshi<\/span><\/a>,\" referencing Satoshi Nakamoto, the name of the person who apparently wrote the white paper on Bitcoin.","Lawyers have been hunting him down for three months.

He appears regularly on TV, has his own podcast and is a touring DJ under the name \u201CDJ Diesel.\u201D Still, process servers struggled to give O\u2019Neal official notice that he is the target of a lawsuit.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Lawyers finally served O\u2019Neal at his home on Sunday afternoon, and say the exchange was captured on video. The case was filed by Oklahoma man Edwin Garrison, an FTX customer, and is being handled by attorneys Adam Moskowitz and David Boies. The news was first shared with The Block.","\u201CWe just served personally Shaquille O\u2019Neal outside his house with a copy of our complaint at 4pm,\u201D Moskowitz said in an email. \u201CWe took Judge Moore\u2019s instructions very seriously and are glad to finally end this silly sideshow.\u201D","Lawyers had been so desperate to find O\u2019Neal ahead of a Monday deadline that they asked a judge to allow them to serve O\u2019Neal via Twitter, Instagram and email. After that request was denied, Moskowitz\u2019s firm resorted to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/moskowitzesq\/status\/1646706733257981953?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeting<\/span><\/a> at him from outside the TNT studios in Atlanta, where O\u2019Neal is a fixture on \u201CThe NBA on TNT.\u201D<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The exchange between O\u2019Neal and a process server was captured on video, lawyers say, though it has yet to be released.

It is not clear who sent the message.","The case illustrates how difficult it can be to serve a celebrity, even one who often appears in public. O\u2019Neal has homes in Florida, Georgia, Nevada, California and the Bahamas, according to court filings.
