Once hit, miners will receive 50% less in bitcoin rewards for every block they verify and add to the blockchain. However, they will continue to earn the additional transaction fees per block as normal.","There have been three halving events in Bitcoin's history so far, reducing its block reward inflation from 50 to 25 BTC in 2012, then to 12.5 BTC in 2016 and 6.25 BTC at the last halving on May 11, 2020. In the long term, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence. The halving events will continue until the last bitcoin is expected to be mined around the year 2140. After this, miners will only earn from transaction fees.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin inflation over time.
