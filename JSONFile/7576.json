Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn. \u201CIt would prove catastrophic to the cryptocurrency industry, and prove catastrophic to all of the consumers that utilize the industry,\u201D continued the Tennessee Republican, who also pointed out possible links between Binance and the Chinese government, which a spokesperson for Binance denied.","Other senators, and multiple witnesses, echoed Hagerty's concern.","\"I'm going to echo some of the concerns my friend from Tennessee just echoed about Binance,\u201D said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., adding that he also found China\u2019s complete ban of digital assets \u201Ccurious.\u201D","In a statement to The Block, a Binance spokesperson denied any connection to China.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CBinance is not a Chinese company \u2014 nor is it even conducting business in China,\u201D the spokesperson told The Block.","\"Regardless of whether Binance itself is connected with the Chinese Communist Party, which Binance denies, but regardless of whether that's the case, by having a system in the United States that's unclear, that's regulatorily hostile, we could go so far as banning cryptocurrency in the United States,\u201D argued Jennifer Schulp, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, another of the witnesses at Wednesday's hearing. \u201CWe would be losing the position of having the possibility to maintain American dominance for these technological innovations.\u201D","Investor, \u201CShark Tank\u201D star and paid FTX spokesperson Kevin O\u2019Leary also turned the spotlight on Binance. \u201CMaybe there's nothing wrong with love and war, but Binance is a massive unregulated global monopoly now,\u201D said O\u2019Leary, who acknowledged in his opening statement that he received $18 million to endorse FTX.","O\u2019Leary elaborated that Bankman-Fried, who was indicted on multiple fraud charges and denied bail in the Bahamas yesterday, told him personally that his firm\u2019s financial insolvency stemmed from buying out Binance chief Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao, though prosecutor accounts of the firm\u2019s operations made in indicting documents, as well as testimony yesterday from new FTX CEO John Ray III, may cast doubt on that anecdote. The celebrity investor also&nbsp;told senators that Bankman-Fried said he was under pressure to buy back FTX shares from the Binance boss because Zhao would not comply with regulatory requests in some jurisdictions and prevented FTX from acquiring licenses to operate.","\u201CThese two behemoths that own the unregulated market together, and grew these incredible businesses in terms of growth, were at war with each other. And one put the other out of business intentionally,\u201D O\u2019Leary said.","FTX\u2019s collapse started with a story by CoinDesk that questioned the strength of Alameda Research\u2019s balance sheet. That prompted Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to say in early November that he would sell a large position of FTX\u2019s native token, which sent the price into freefall. Binance briefly considered buying FTX but quickly pulled out of the deal. The exchange and its related entities filed for bankruptcy protection days later. Still, lawmakers in both parties sounded the alarm around Binance.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CU.S. regulators are limited in the extent to which they can mandate appropriate audits or appropriate disclosure of Binance\u2019s operations,\u201D Hagerty said. \u201CBinance operates outside of our system.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., noted money laundering investigations around the firm and introduced a bipartisan bill this morning that would tighten reporting requirements for offshore digital asset accounts.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nActor and author Ben McKenzie Schenkkan \u2013 \u201CRyan from 'The O.C.,'\u201D as he jokingly referred to himself \u2013 and American University Washington College of Law Professor Hilary Allen also testified and reiterated their public skepticism around digital assets.","<i data-stringify-type=\"italic\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
