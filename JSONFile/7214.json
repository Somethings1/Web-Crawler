Our team of security researchers, white hat hackers and cloud engineers will continue to refine and enhance our machine learning algorithms and consult with our clients to prioritize new features.\"","Cube3 uses machine learning algorithms to check blockchain-based transactions as they occur. If a malicious transaction is detected, the algorithm sends an alert for the company to deploy a smart contract and prevent the transaction from going through.&nbsp;The startup protects transactions on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Arbitrum and Polygon, with Avalanche coming later this month.","\"As the recent Curve example shows, these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/242159\/curve-finance-exploit-has-shaken-confidence-in-defi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">exploits<\/a> can happen to anyone,\" Gravrock said. \"Curve Finance has been around since the start of 2020. It conducted audits and has an active <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243464\/curve-exploit-identity-bounty\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bug bounty<\/a> program, but the hackers were very thorough in executing this exploit.
