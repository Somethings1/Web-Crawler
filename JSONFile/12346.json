Though the agency has not proposed crypto specific rules, the SEC has proposed rules over the past year that apply to crypto. For example the SEC reopened a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/211786\/sec-to-vote-on-rule-that-would-tighten-crypto-custody-requirements\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">custody<\/span><\/a> rule that would require registered investment advisors to keep crypto with a qualified custodian, and require those custodians to follow certain requirements.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC has also taken enforcement actions over the past year, including against Coinbase for operating as an unregistered exchange, which is ongoing. Coinbase has said the judge should throw out that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/259304\/coinbase-says-sec-is-out-of-bounds-in-latest-brief-of-ongoing-lawsuit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">case<\/span><\/a>.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The agency often cites the Howey Test in those enforcement actions, a <\/span><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">1946 U.S. Supreme Court case involving citrus groves to determine whether transactions are investment contracts and thus subject to securities laws<\/span><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. Gensler said on Friday that the test is flexible.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The Howey Court said that the definition of an investment contract 'embodies a flexible, rather than a static, principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits,'\" Gensler said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An important part of the SEC's responsibility is figuring out how to divvy out resources, Gensler said. He emphasized that the crypto market is small compared to the rest of the capital markets, whichthe agency oversees.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"While the crypto market experiences outsize fraud, abuse, and noncompliance relative to its size, it nevertheless is a small portion of the bigger-than-$110 trillion capital markets. It is important that the Commission maintain discretion to direct focus to whichever parts of the capital markets need updated regulation,\" Gensler said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda said on Friday that they disagreed with the agency's decision, adding that there is a need for dialogue that could then lead to guidance or rulemaking.<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We acknowledge that the Commission has broad discretion to set the timing and priorities of its rulemaking agenda,\" they said. \"In our view, the Petition raises issues presented by new technologies and other innovations, and addressing these important issues is a core part of being a responsible regulator.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Any exploration of these issues should include public roundtables, concept releases, and requests for comment, which would afford us the opportunity to hear from a wide range of market participants and other interested parties,\" they added.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated at 10:40 a.m. ET with details throughout&nbsp;<\/em>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
