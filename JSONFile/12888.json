Shortly after, it was burned and recreated as Ordinals inscription <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ord.io\/12456749\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">12,456,749<\/a> on Bitcoin, mirroring the image of the original Ethereum CryptoPunk.

Plus, when this happens the new token won't have the same privileges as those in the original collection.","The idea behind the move was a collaborative <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/natan_stein\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">initiative<\/a> led by Nathan Stein, a Wolf Capital developer supported by the Bitcoin Bandits NFT collection community, Decrypt first <a href=\"https:\/\/decrypt.co\/145172\/95k-cryptopunk-nft-burned-by-bitcoin-bandits-revived-as-ordinals-inscription\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a>. Around 150 individuals pooled their funds together for the cause, which aimed to demonstrate the symbolic transition of valuable assets from Ethereum to Bitcoin. The goal is to create a series of Ordinals inscriptions that represent fractional ownership in the CryptoPunk, even though the NFT itself is no longer owned on its original chain.","When an asset is burned, it is permanently stored in an address beyond anyone's control.
