In April the combined project suffered an $80 million hack. As The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/164611\/tribe-dao-proposes-a-157-million-redemption-for-token-holders-rari-hack-victims\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a>, Tribe DAO has now proposed a $157 million redemption package aimed at compensating victims &nbsp;\u2014 one that would ultimately result in the dissolution of the DAO itself.","It\u2019s the redemption package with which Kazemian takes issue. He <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/samkazemian\/status\/1560922661387001856\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">argued<\/a> on Twitter that the plan provides little to compensate affected protocols, including Frax and Olympus, as well as individuals who were hurt by the hack. He claims the protocol could instead redeem all of the stablecoins, repay all of the victims and have millions in value left over for Tribe\u2019s governance holders.&nbsp;","\u201CAn honorable, ethical, &amp; respectable shutdown of a DAO is literally perfectly here. The money is there. The full repayment, the perfect peg redemption, &amp; moral precedent is possible. I truly don't understand how it's possible to look at this, then decide \"Na let's take the rest,\u201D he said.","He added, \u201CThis is truly one of the most mind boggling situations I've seen.\u201D","In response to the redemption package proposal, Jack Longarzo, a core contributor to Rari Capital, <a href=\"https:\/\/tribe.fei.money\/t\/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao\/4475\/7\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acknowledged<\/a> that while the package will reimburse most affected addresses, \u201Ca handful of the larger victims will only be partially reimbursed.\u201D","Frax is a stablecoin project that is competitive with Fei, which Kazemian has <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/samkazemian\/status\/1378499341292236800?lang=en-GB\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">openly criticized<\/a> in the past. Still, the fates of the two projects have become more connected because of the hack.","After it happened, Kazemian said that Frax was one of Fei\u2019s biggest supporters and users, acknowledging that Frax had been impacted by the hack. In today's thread, he said that he had since tried to get in contact with the protocol\u2019s founder, Joey Santoro, but to no avail.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
