Recent survey data collected by The Block that indicates that Taproot is high on the list of technological developments being followed.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin relies on public-key cryptography to validate transactions. The current Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm has several shortcomings when it comes to privacy and fungibility, and the Taproot\/Schnorr soft fork aims to fix them by hiding specific payment types from outside observers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In his presentation, Lee gave the example of a 2-of-3 multi-signature design to illustrate how Taproot could bring benefits to the network.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Suppose there's an exchange featuring a hot key, a trusted 3rd party key, and a cold wallet emergency backup key, he said. Conventionally, participants would need to broadcast all three keys as well as the two signatures used to spend the coins. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The proposed upgrade, however, would aggregate these keys into a single Schnorr signature, which would then be used to validate a Taproot output key that represents all the complexities involved.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As a result, observers of the blockchain would simply see a single output without knowing which two keys were deployed to validate the transaction. This would reduce transaction size, save fees, and improve privacy, Lee said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CYou can have a Lightning channel open or closed, a simple payment between two people, or a very sophisticated smart contract, and they all of the sudden became indistinguishable by spending Bitcoin using Taproot,\u201D he contended.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Taproot also opens the door for inscription innovation, according to Lee, as it allows for complicated arrangements of signatures and keys and eliminates limitations for how many scripts can be used to spend coins.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe benefits are very clear and overwhelming and there\u2019s really no known controversy or concern with it,\u201D Lee said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Taproot is attracting wide interest from the Bitcoin community, new survey data indicates.<\/span>","Indeed, the Taproot\/Schnorr upgrade was the third-most popular write-in topic that industry participants said they are most excited to see in 2020, according to The Block's soon-to-be-released research survey of over 100 investors, analysts and executives, among others.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin Core developer and Bitcoin Fellow at Blockchain Capital, echoed the optimism and predicted that Taproot will not only save fees and blockspace, but also enable new features and generate more interests to the network.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere will no longer be any penalties in terms of fees for multisig and that should lead the industry toward using best practices,\u201D he told The Block. \u201CWe expect that this will create more interest in Lightning in general as the bleeding edge of Bitcoin will be a little less bloody.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CFinally, we expect Taproot to be incorporated by more wallets and more interesting features built for those who are securing their Bitcoin,\u201D he added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wuille\u2019s draft has not been formally proposed as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, or BIP, but the Bitcoin Core contributor told The Block that he plans to undertake that step. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After that, he will open a pull request to Bitcoin Core with the proposed consensus rule changes, which will likely bring in another round of reviews around Taproot\u2019s implementation.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf all goes well, and it's clear that Taproot as proposed is what the ecosystem is willing to adopt, it will be merged, and discussion will start about how to activate it on the network,\u201D Wuille said. \u201CIf that too goes well, a release with the activation will be published, and if the conditions to activate it are met, we'll be live.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin\u2019s consensus layers have not seen any soft fork or hard fork for over two years. The last upgrade was Segregated Witness (SegWit), which was activated in Aug. 2017 and recently hit a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/transactionfee.info\/charts\/payments\/segwit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">60%<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> adoption rate.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, as the Bitcoin community enters 2020, there are a number of other notable proposals on the horizon as well. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Besides Taproot and Schnorr, potential upgrades also include Graftroot, SIGHASH_NOINPUT, the \u201CGreat Consensus Clean-up,\u201D and OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY:<\/span>","Graftroot is a follow-up proposal made by Maxwell and aimed at offering similar benefits as Taproot while offering greater efficiency and flexibility for smart contracts. Compared to Taproot, which generates a threshold public key representing all scripting conditions, Graftroot creates a key for each condition, allowing participants to delegate their ability to sign a specific script to anyone they choose.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One drawback of Graftroot is that it requires participants to communicate with each other in order to sign the alternative scripts. Wuille said he didn't include Graftroot because it's not applicable to as large a set of use cases as Taproot, and requires an interactive setup at sending time, thus making it unusable for transactions in contexts like paper wallets.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the \u201CNoinput\u201D feature, signatures would not need to commit to any of the inputs and, consequently, the outputs being spent. This would make possible the rewriting of a signed transaction without generating a new signature and streamline the Lightning user experience.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Wuille, it was not included because there is still active discussion on how exactly to incorporate it, and it can be implemented later with effectively no downsides.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This proposed update seeks to remove long-known vulnerabilities connected to transaction validation and make the network more robust. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For example, it would remove transactions that require excessive possessing power and address weak spots in the protocol\u2019s difficulty adjustment algorithm. Right now, these problems are taken care of on a case-to-case basis.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This opcode would, if implemented, help address network congestion and expenses during peak hours by essentially allowing a transaction to be cut in two with the goal of making<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;the fee market more stable. It would also enable Bitcoin vault setups and better Channel Factories on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tag\/lightning-network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lightning Network<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Developers have long been contemplating how to best arrange and carry out these upgrades. Wuille told The Block that his draft proposal excludes some features due to the technical complexities they pose.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI don't think that Bitcoin would tolerate one new soft fork every month that introduces a new feature, for logistical and technical reasons,\u201D he said. \u201CAt the same time, combining literally everything we know of as potentially beneficial change would become very complex to review.\u201D<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
