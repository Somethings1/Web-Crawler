But at least in the eyes of traders, INJ has suffered a reversal, falling nearly 30% so far in 2024.","According to a press release seen by CoinDesk, the integration for developers means that it \u201Cunlocks new opportunities to build within the Ethereum L2 ecosystem while retaining Injective\u2019s lightning-fast speeds and low fees.\u201D","The teams also shared that transacting on the inEVM network will contribute to the tokenomics of the Injective ecosystem, including the burning mechanisms of its $INJ token, \u201Cwhich aggregates and systematically burns a percentage of all protocol fees on a weekly basis.\u201D","\u201CThe significance of Injective\u2019s integration with Arbitrum extends beyond just building blockchain networks or infrastructure,\u201D said Eric Chen, the co-founder of Injective Labs (and a speaker at this year's Consensus festival), in the press release. \u201CIt enforces the fundamental principle of interoperability \u2013 closing the gap between Ethereum, Cosmos and other widely adopted L1s \u2013 for an ecosystem where cross-chain assets and liquidity can be truly composable across ecosystems.\"","Read more: Injective Introduces 'ERC-404' Port to Capitalize on the Hype Around the Experimental Token Standard"],"entity":[{"type":"INJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Eric Chen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hype Around the Experimental Token Standard","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"30%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"25%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Cosmos","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$INJ","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Arbitrum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Injective","Injective Labs","Arbitrum","Offchain labs","Consensus 2024"],"authors":["Margaux Nijkerk"]}
