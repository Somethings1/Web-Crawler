The SEC has accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion in 2020 through the sale of XRP and has also sued CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What kind of precedent the decision could set for the broader digital asset industry will be up to the judge, though either way it figures to influence the value of XRP, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a total market value of over $28 billion as of Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe general impact could be highly specific to the facts of SEC v. Ripple, limiting any broader impact,\u201D said Ashley Ebersole, general counsel at 0x Labs and a former SEC lawyer. \u201COr the court could release an opinion that reaches more legal issues and has a more dramatic effect.\u201D&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Others say the case has been overhyped and really won\u2019t have a major legal impact.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CRegardless of who wins, the actual impact on regulation is near zero other than the fate of Ripple itself and its counsel and executives,\u201D said <\/span><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ty Gellasch, a one-time counsel to former SEC Commissioner Kara Stein, now president and CEO of the Healthy Markets Association. \u201C<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If Ripple wins, it will be a pretty significant public relations win even if it\u2019s not an important legal one for the industry. \u201C&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If the SEC wins, Gellasch said he expects a day of \u201Cchest pumping\u201D and for the SEC and the industry to then move on quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If the court decides that XRP is a security that would make the sale of XRP an unregistered securities offering in violation of the law. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The court could also address secondary market transactions, because XRP was issued on exchanges, said Gary DeWaal, senior counsel at law firm Katten. XRP was distributed on crypto trading platforms and because of that, the court could come up \u201Cwith a more expansive decision,\u201D DeWaal said, though p<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ast initial coin offering cases have not also seen repercussions for secondary market sales DeWaal said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An initial coin offering case made late last year could serve as a guidepost as to what might happen with Ripple. A New Hampshire district court <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/183770\/sec-wins-suit-against-lbry-in-major-blow-to-crypto-token-issuance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ruled against<\/span><\/a> decentralized publishing platform LBRY, which argued that the SEC did not provide enough warning that the platform's LBC token was an investment contract. The court ruled in the SEC's favor.&nbsp;<\/span>","If the decision is just limited to whether XRP is an investment contract in connection with the initial offering, that \"<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">will be a very specific facts and circumstances decision,\" DeWaal said.&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMy guess is that it will be a victory of public opinion for the SEC but it will probably not move the bar tremendously from where it is today,\" with regards to U.S. law around digital assets.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Other sources said the SEC has a strong argument in finding that XRP is an investment contract. <\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COne could say that the SEC is undefeated when it comes to digital assets and what they think are securities,\u201D said Aaron Kaplan, co-CEO and co-founder of Prometheum, a digital asset infrastructure firm.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If a judge does decide that XRP is a security, the scope could go beyond XRP to other cryptocurrencies, Kaplan argued, as it would further establish precedent for future rulings over other tokens.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think that there could be some sort of effect where virtual currency exchanges are much more concerned and aware of the potential regulatory implications of certain assets they\u2019re trading,\u201D Kaplan said. \u201CBut the larger intellectual paradigm shift is occurring already.\u201D&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple has made a fair notice argument in court, saying that the SEC did not give enough advance warning that selling XRP was not allowed, essentially echoing broader criticism from the industry over lack of specific digital asset guidance from the agency. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A recent Supreme Court decision in a banking-related case, Bittner v. United States, supported that fair notice argument.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWithout fair notice of what activity is prohibited by the statutory language, Ripple can claim [its] right of due process has been violated, which provides a defense that will negate liability,\u201D <\/span><span class=\"s5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said Agnes<\/span><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Gambill West, a visiting senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If Ripple wins, especially on its arguments of whether it was given fair notice that the agency considered XRP to be a security, that could lead to a \u201Cpowerful defense,\u201D she said. Other crypto companies then could use that against future SEC litigation, she added. <\/span><span class=\"s5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Such a ruling would be a big win for the industry.\u201D&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A Ripple win could mean a win for \u201Cpolitical press relations,\u201D of the crypto industry and its allies, said Better Markets\u2019 Gellasch. \"<\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If Ripple were to win, I would expect some policy, some lawmakers, maybe even some existing regulators, certainly crypto industry titans to say \u2014 see we told you all along that this stuff can\u2019t be securities,\u201D Gellasch said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A Ripple win for the industry won\u2019t be vast and won\u2019t hamstring the SEC, he said.

The court may also choose not issue a full summary judgement either.&nbsp;&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere are three options here \u2014 one side wins, other side wins, nobody wins and the fight goes on,\u201D Gellasch said.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
