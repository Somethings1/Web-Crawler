Vault owners were set to be liquidated at around $100, but the Maker oracles didn't update the ETH-USD price in time and faced delays due to network congestion and high gas prices at the time.","As a result, many auctions were triggered and allowed some liquidators to win these auctions with zero DAI bids. This resulted in some Vault owners losing all their collateral.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAuctions in the Maker protocol are triggered when the system has DAI debt below a specified debt limit.
