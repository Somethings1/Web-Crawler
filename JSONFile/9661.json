It can improve settlement times. It can make it cheaper to send money to your family overseas in another country.\"","\"Regardless of what you think about it, it's not going anywhere,\" he said.&nbsp; &nbsp;\"It can't be un-invented.\"","Coinbase has been embroiled in a lengthy fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission and has been pushing for new rules for the industry.

The company has warned that an unfavorable regulatory climate in the U.S. could push development overseas.","In the new ad, Armstrong said he worried that the U.S. could face a national security issue like it saw after many&nbsp;advancements in 5G technology and semiconductors had been offshored.&nbsp;","\"If you want to help the average person in America, we need to make sure we have economic growth,\" he said. \"Everything that underpins that comes from science and technology.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
