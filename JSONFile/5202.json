There are a variety of factors, but UX is arguably the biggest one,\u201D said Rachel Lin, co-founder and CEO of SynFutures. \u201CThese obstacles impact most DeFi protocols, but they\u2019re even more detrimental for products that provide more complex offerings, such as derivatives products.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The complexity of trading decentralized derivatives may be one reason why the market hasn\u2019t yet reached its stride. While the derivatives market in both traditional financial markets and centralized crypto exchanges are multiples larger than their spot counterparts, the opposite is true in decentralized markets. The lack of a seamless, easy-to-navigate UX across decentralized derivatives offerings is hindering progress. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Improving the Derivatives Trading Experience&nbsp;<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the launch of its V1 public beta last year, SynFutures set the stage for a radically improved derivatives trading experience, proving that a DeFi derivatives protocol can be as permissionless and easy to use as spot DEXs. SynFutures adapted the Uniswap V3 model for the derivatives market, allowing users to list and trade futures on any asset with just a few clicks. Enabling users to provide liquidity with a single token further streamlined the listing process by removing the need to provide liquidity to both assets in the pair. Furthermore, the interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy for new users to explore derivatives.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While Polygon is its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/138224\/synfutures-surfaces-as-leading-derivatives-exchange-on-polygon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">most active chain<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, SynFutures employs a multi-chain strategy, having already deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain, with plans to expand to additional&nbsp; EVM and non-EVM chains by the end of the year.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The platform\u2019s approach to UX has attracted more than 56,000 users and led to billions in cumulative trading volume. Its focus on creating a user-friendly platform has also helped attract an increasingly active retail user base. While typically a few addresses account for the majority of trading volume across decentralized derivatives platforms, SynFutures\u2019 top five traders account for less than 5 percent of the DEX\u2019s total trading volume, signaling its traction with retail users.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Launching SynFutures V2 and Beyond<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the upcoming V2 launch, SynFutures is introducing an even easier-to-use interface to improve the user experience, as well as a streamlined experience for liquidity providers.
