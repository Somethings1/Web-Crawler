But developers are increasingly turning to \"modular\" designs, where networks can strap together different components and providers to serve the various functions.","The goal of the new Polygon Labs project is to blend it all together.","\"Devs can connect any layer-1 or layer-2 chain to the AggLayer, building a Web3 network that feels like a single chain with unified liquidity and practically unlimited scalability,\" the post reads.","The idea stems from the shortcomings of modular and monolithic blockchains, Polygon Labs said. On the AggLayer, users can buy non-fungible tokens on a different chain without having to bridge those funds by making use of ZK proofs, or send assets to participate in activities on other chains.","\u201CAggregation offers the sovereignty and scale of modular architectures, as well as the unified liquidity and UX of a monolithic system, synthesizing these two approaches into something novel,\u201D Polygon Labs wrote. \"UX\" is short for \"user experience.\"","Read more: Polygon 2.0 Roadmap Calls for \u2018Unified Liquidity,\u2019 Restaking, New Chains on Demand","Edited by Bradley Keoun."],"entity":[{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Polygon Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bradley Keoun","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Polygon","Polygon labs"],"authors":["Margaux Nijkerk"]}
