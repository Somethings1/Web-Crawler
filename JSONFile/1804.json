The recent SEC approval of a spot bitcoin ETF has encouraged speculation that a spot ether ETF could also happen in the near future, Head of Research at ETC Group André Dragosch told The Block. He said that such an eventuality would prove bullish for the second largest digital asset by market cap.<\/span>","Dragosch also said that the recent high in ether circulating supply in profit could also be seen as a stabilizing factor for the token.","\"The reason is that there tends to be less incentives to sell the asset in these conditions, especially by longer term holders. However, weak holders might still be inclined to take profits, but net it is definitely supportive for an ongoing bull market,\" he added.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
