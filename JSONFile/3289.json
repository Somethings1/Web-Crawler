On June 3, the regulator <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/107057\/uk-fca-new-registration-deadline-crypto-march-2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">kicked the deadline back once again<\/a> \u2014 all the way to March 31 next year.","Philip Davies, Conservative member of Parliament (MP) for Shipley, West Yorkshire, put pressure on H.M. Treasury in late May by addressing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/105944\/politician-answers-sunak-delays-fca-crypto-register\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a series of written questions over the delays<\/a> to U.K. chancellor Rishi Sunak. Glen <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/106452\/city-minister-john-glen-crypto-aml-standards\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hit back<\/a> on May 28, stating that a \u201Csignificant number of firms have failed to implement appropriately robust AML control frameworks, and to employ fit and proper personnel.\u201D","Apparently dissatisfied with that response, Davies \u2014 who has a reputation for frustrating legislation in parliament with drawn-out objections \u2014 put yet more questions to the chancellor, enquiring as to the \u201Cappropriateness\u201D of the FCA retaining its role as supervisor of the crypto sector.","In <a href=\"https:\/\/questions-statements.parliament.uk\/written-questions\/detail\/2021-06-10\/13890\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a response<\/a> published June 18, Glen stressed the need to \u201Cbalance the potential risk to consumers with the ambition to foster competition and innovation in the sector,\u201D but also conceded that the regulator is beefing up its crypto capabilities.","\u201CThe government believes that the FCA\u2019s expertise in the regulation of financial products, its membership of the Cryptoasset Taskforce, and its experience as anti-money laundering supervisor for other asset-based financial services firms makes it the right supervisor for the cryptoasset sector,\u201D he said. \u201CAs a result of the longer than anticipated time being taken to process applications, I can confirm that the FCA has increased considerably the resources allocated to assessing applications.\u201D","Glen\u2019s response also included fresh information on the length of the waiting times faced by the U.K.\u2019s crypto startups.","The mean length of time firms have waited for the green light is 248 days (and counting, presumably). The median wait is 252 days. The longest an applicant has been made to wait for an answer from the regulator \u2014 in other words, had its application under review \u2014 is 527 days.","In the meantime, the <a href=\"https:\/\/register.fca.org.uk\/s\/search?predefined=CA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto register<\/a> has only five fully registered entities.","Â© 2023 The Block.
