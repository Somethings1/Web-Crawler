This scenario is likely to temper current market expectations for an early easing of monetary policies in developed markets, which may lead to some disappointment among investors,\" he added.","In an email sent to The Block, Kooner outlined various headwinds that could frustrate market growth in the year ahead. \"Looking ahead to 2024, the outlook for equity markets appears more challenging. Factors such as modest earnings growth and various geopolitical risks are expected to exert downward pressure on stock markets,\" he added.","His forecast is that 2024 will be a year of only modest growth. \"There may only be modest earnings growth for the S&amp;P 500, in the range of 2% to 3% and a target of 4,200 for the index, with a downside bias,\" he said.","TRES Co-Founder Tal Zackon told The Block that newly approved <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278250\/vanecks-spot-bitcoin-etf-volume-skyrockets-over-1000-day-before-lower-fee-comes-into-effect\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">spot bitcoin ETFs<\/a> are making it easier for traditional investors to use bitcoin as a hedge against inflationary pressures.","Zackon also outlined a number of factors supporting bitcoins status as a safe haven amid uncertain macroeconomic conditions.","\"The upcoming bitcoin halving in April, a unique mechanism limiting supply, reaffirms bitcoin's potential as a potent anti-inflation tool,\" he added.","The next <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278471\/bitcoin-call-options-cluster-above-60000-indicating-post-halving-bullish-sentiment-analyst-says\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin halving<\/a>, slated for April this year, will cut the miners' reward for validating and adding new blocks to the blockchain by 50%.","This halving event, which occurs roughly every four years or after every 210,000 blocks mined, aims to reduce the block reward. The previous halving in 2020 decreased the reward from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25 bitcoin.","After approximately 840,000 blocks are mined, the upcoming halving will further reduce the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This built-in feature of the Bitcoin protocol helps manage the new bitcoin supply, gradually making it scarcer.","Bitcoin was changing hands for $50,890 at 5:40 p.m. ET, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" data-v-02bbd79b=\"\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's Price Page<\/a>.
