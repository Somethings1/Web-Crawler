To foster further growth, there is a pressing need for a solution that not only enables seamless interactions across Bitcoin, Bitcoin Layer-2s, Ethereum, and Ethereum Layer-2s. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAddressing this need for interoperability, Polyhedra Network introduced the Bitcoin Messaging Protocol powered by zkBridge, the interoperability protocol designed and implemented by Polyhedra Network. This pioneering development expands Bitcoin's functionality, enabling it to interact seamlessly with a range of blockchain networks, both Layer-1s and Layer-2s.","<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nUsing zkBridge, Bitcoin can now securely transmit its current and historical data, utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, to 20+ networks including Bitcoin Layer-2s, Ethereum, and Ethereum Layer-2s. This interoperability extends to recent Bitcoin innovations such as Ordinals, BRC-20, and Atomicals. To enable other blockchains to securely write messages to Bitcoin, the protocol employs a Proof-of-Stake mechanism with a carefully designed slashing mechanism, to overcome Bitcoin\u2019s lack of smart contract functionality.","Polyhedra Network has joined forces with key builders within the Bitcoin ecosystem across infrastructures, wallets, Bitcoin layer-2s, DeFi, and tools. Together, they are introducing the largest Interoperable Bitcoin Ecosystem empowered by zkBridge.
