This is roughly equivalent to 11% of its net asset value, which was $279 million (£240.6 million) as of September.&nbsp;","In a news release today, the company said it had no exposure to Alameda Research, the sister company of the exchange, and that it had been in the process of withdrawing funds from the exchange over the past week.","\"Thanks to our prudent approach to risk, we had materially reduced our exposure to FTX exchange in response to increased volatility and uncertainty, ahead of FTX\u2019s decision to freeze further withdrawals,\" said CoinShare CEO Jean Marie Mognetti.&nbsp;","On Tuesday, FTX halted withdrawals amid a liquidity crisis. The same day, FTX said it had agreed to be acquired by rival Binance. Wednesday, after Binance reviewed FTX's financials, the acquisition <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/184636\/binance-backs-out-of-ftx-acquisition-deal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fell through<\/a>.
