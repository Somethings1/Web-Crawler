The last thing we need is for risky new financial products to crash our financial system. Thank you those of you on the panel for your skepticism about cryptocurrencies.\u201D","Brown has been critical of the industry in the past, but cast today's remarks in the context of the recent collapse of FTX.&nbsp;","Brown's Republican counterpart, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Penn., pushed back on this sentiment in his line of questioning.","\u201CThe insinuation was that they might have the ability to crash our financial system,\u201D Toomey said. \"It\u2019s fundamentally not about the kind of assets held at FTX, it\u2019s about what individuals did with those assets.\u201D&nbsp;","Toomey drew a comparison to MF Global's bankruptcy. \u201CNobody suggested that the problem was the instruments that were used. The problem was the use of customer funds.\u201D","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
