A miner-led Ethereum fork may also go live once The Merge happens. Trading on the native token of this forked Ethereum chain may take place across a few crypto exchanges.","Ethereum\u2019s pivot from proof of work to proof of stake, the heralded event known as The Merge, will take center stage. The network already passed the last mile marker before The Merge, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/167962\/ethereum-activates-bellatrix-upgrade-as-last-step-before-the-merge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the Bellatrix upgrade<\/a>. The Merge itself will likely happen on Sept. 15 and node runners will be making final preparations to update their clients in anticipation of the network transition.","The Merge will bring <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/166708\/the-merge-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ethereums-big-upgrade\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">notable changes to Ethereum<\/a>, including a reduction in both the network\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/166868\/after-the-merge-nearly-all-nfts-will-be-environmentally-friendly\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">energy usage<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/167841\/how-ethereums-monetary-policy-will-change-after-the-merge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">new token issuance<\/a>. Validators will replace miners in the work. As such, Ethereum will no longer be secured by mining hardware, but by the economic value of ether tokens staked by participants. The Merge will not, however, make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/166931\/why-the-merge-wont-solve-ethereums-scaling-challenges\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum more scalable<\/a> or offer a reduction in transaction fees.","Not all Ethereum network participants are in favor of The Merge. Some miners previously announced plans for a fork, a network split, with their own chain retaining Ethereum\u2019s proof-of-work consensus.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162019\/three-crypto-exchanges-are-letting-traders-bet-on-tokens-for-anticipated-ethereum-fork\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Some crypto exchanges<\/a> have already said they will recognize ETHPoW, the name adopted by the potential <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163229\/ethpow-team-says-its-miner-led-ethereum-fork-is-inevitable\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">miner-led fork chain<\/a>. If the chain split does occur, then trading on this ETHPoW token is likely to happen. Still, notable Ethereum personalities, including its co-creator Vitalik Buterin have said the fork is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162066\/potential-ethereum-proof-of-work-fork-unlikely-to-succeed-says-vitalik-buterin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">unlikely to succeed<\/a>. &nbsp;","Buterin made a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169058\/vitalik-buterin-makes-surprise-appearance-at-kyiv-tech-summit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">surprise appearance<\/a> at the Kyiv Tech Summit last week, and there are several other crypto and blockchain events set to happen this coming week.
