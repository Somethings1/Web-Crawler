Diana McDonald et al., Case 1:19-cv-01005-MLB, N.D. Ga., 3\/1\/19 [SDP]<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/strong><\/em>","A number of crypto lawsuits have involved escrow arrangements gone awry. This case seems to be the latest, with the added peculiarity that a lawyer is allegedly involved. In a nutshell, the plaintiffs allege that they wired $4 million to a lawyer\u2019s trust account and expected to receive bitcoin in exchange, and that they haven\u2019t received the bitcoin and that only half of their money was returned. The lawyer has since responded and says that she didn\u2019t do anything wrong and that if there was a scam that she is a victim too.","It\u2019s a little bit challenging to figure out exactly what happened here, and the plaintiff and the defendant present a different view of the facts. The pleadings are a tangled web of accusation and response. According to the plaintiff, \u201CValkyrie [one of the defendants] promised that it would provide Bitcoin to GSR Markets [plaintiff]in exchange for $4 million. In reliance on that promise, GSR Markets wired $4 million into the Wells Fargo IOLTA account (a fiduciary account) of McDonald and McDonald Law [also defendants]. After the bitcoin didn\u2019t arrive, plaintiff says it demanded its money and only received half, while the defendants kept the other $2 million. Plaintiff is a Hong Kong company and all of the defendants are American.","Plaintiff says that it acted a broker for a company called Alivia Corporation Pty, Ltd. (\u201CAlivia\u201D). It also alleges that \u201C[o]n January 3, 2019, Plaintiff wired $4,000,000 into the Account, expecting that it would immediately receive 1,000 Bitcoins from the Sellers. Based on that expectation, GSR Markets shorted those 1,000 Bitcoins, based on a purchase price of $3,635 per Bitcoin.\u201D No bitcoin ever arrived, and Plaintiff says it also lost $380,000 in order to unwind its short position. Plaintiff says they got $2 million back but are still out of pocket $2 million.","Plaintiff asks for injunctive relief and also alleges fraud and breach of fiduciary duty against the law firm. The breach of fiduciary theory is premised on the the theory that \u201CMcDonald and McDonald Law were to hold Plaintiff\u2019s funds in the Account in trust for Plaintiff. As such, they owed certain fiduciary duties to Plaintiff, including the duty to act in good faith and in the best interests of Plaintiff.\u201D In addition to suing the lawyer and the seller, plaintiff also sued Wells Fargo bank\u200A\u2014\u200Awhere the IOLTA account was held\u200A\u2014\u200Afor aiding and abetting fraud. Their lawyer also filed a complaint with the Georgia bar. The Court has entered a temporary restraining order freezing any funds held by the lawyer\u200A\u2014\u200AIOLTA or not\u200A\u2014\u200Aat Wells Fargo Bank.","The lawyer has since filed a response and says that she didn\u2019t owe a fiduciary duty to the buyer\u200A\u2014\u200Athat her duties only ran to the seller. She further says after wiring a portion of the funds to \u201Cunlock\u201D a bitcoin wallet, the Seller \u201Cinformed Defendant McDonald that there was a delay in delivery of the Bitcoin to GSR because of hacking issues affecting [its]storage systems.\u201D She also claims that Plaintiff \u201Cconfirmed delivery of 2000 \u201Cnon-spendable\u201D bitcoin, which probably \u2026 isn\u2019t \u2026 actually \u2026 a thing.","Most cases have two sides and this one appears to be no different. I am not suggesting that this lawyer was in cahoots with a scammer. I would suggest, however, that it is a really questionable proposition for lawyers to act as escrow agents and use their trust accounts for bitcoin transactions, and even more so when they don\u2019t clearly understand how the stuff works.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
