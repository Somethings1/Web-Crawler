At one point the crypto lender crypto lender held $30 billion in assets. A court-ordered bankruptcy examiner\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207007\/celsius-lost-800-million-risky-bets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a> found that Celsius made risky investment bets with customer funds.","Echoing accusations from the examiner's report, the SEC accuses Celsius of secretly buying CEL to pump the value of the token, and repeatedly engaging in business practices that Mashinsky publicly said it did not do, including betting against bitcoin and making large unsecured loans to other companies.&nbsp;","According to the SEC, Mashinsky tweeted in <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">September 2020 that, \u201CCelsius does not trade or take long or short positions with customer coins.\u201D But the agency alleges the company shorted bitcoin in 2019, using Celsius customer funds.

That includes allegedly lending billions to other companies without any collateral despite repeatedly saying that Celsius did not do that. By 2022, the year of its failure, the company had over $1 billion in unbacked, outstanding loans out to other institutions, and according to internal Celsius documents, Mashinsky was repeatedly warned by employees that he made misleading statements about the company's business and financial state, including the uncollateralized loans.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C[W]e do not offer any non-collateralized loans,\u201D the SEC's filing quotes Mashinsky as telling CNBC in an April 2022 interview.
