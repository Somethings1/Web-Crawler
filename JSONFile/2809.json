Centralized cloud storage solutions have their qualities and have served well their purpose since the inception of the internet and the web as we know it. However, they are not necessarily well suited for data to be controlled by users and to support web3 and its decentralized needs. Centralized solutions are here to stay, alongside decentralized storage that brings diversity and choice to users and individuals for higher control over their data, their privacy and propriety.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The future of our relationship with data is decentralized storage at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ethswarm.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Swarm<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">: a censorship-resistant, unstoppable and serverless data storage and distribution technology.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the launch of its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/198043\/swarm-launches-storage-incentives-program-to-distribute-rewards-to-storage-providers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">storage incentives program<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in December 2022, Swarm reached a significant milestone in the development of its Network. It is now possible to earn rewards for running a node in Swarm and being a critical participant in the Network\u2019s functioning.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The incentive system has been running smoothly since its launch. Rigorous testing has confirmed the fair distribution of rewards, per the system\u2019s intended design. The next step is the planned increase of the fees pertaining to the use of the Network, which means an increase in the rewards distributed to node operators. It is possible it\u2019ll ensure a roughly <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">6000x increase in the total earnings for Storers<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, to better match the market values of the services.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By valuing decentralization, the Network is now self-sustainable, where all actors are incentivised to use Swarm over and alongside other solutions.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Swarm\u2019s incentivization model works with a simple but effective principle\u2014<\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Uploaders pay, Storers earn<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. This ensures optimum utilization and availability of storage resources on the Network.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Redistributing the storage fees among storers is one of the protocol\u2019s key functions. Swarm ensures complete fairness and fault tolerance to this end by implementing the Schelling Game.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As Daniel Nagy, the VP of Swam Foundation, says: \u201C<\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It follows the logic that if node operators want to earn rewards for storing data, they need to regularly prove their storage, while staking some BZZ, to insure that they are being honest about their claim.<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201D<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.ethswarm.org\/foundation\/2022\/monthly-ecosystem-call-29-september-2022-recap\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Schelling Game<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is similar to ordinary Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. Briefly put, the algorithm randomly selects a \u201Cneighborhood\u201D of nodes\u2014i.e., those storing the same content\u2014and requires them to achieve consensus. The nodes\u2019 shared content is the input for this process, meaning that honest calculations must necessarily return the same results.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An on-chain redistribution contract randomly allocates the rewards to one of the honest nodes at the end of each round. The probability of being rewarded increases with the node\u2019s staking amount. Currently, 10 BZZ token is the minimum staking amount for storage nodes to be eligible for redistribution. Notably, this stake may be frozen (and eventually slashed) if nodes misbehave, act maliciously, or fail to achieve consensus with their neighbors.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The winning node in each round receives the entire pot of storage rent collected since the last distribution. With the latest update, the overall rewards for storage node operators, increases by 6000x.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The storage cost for uploaders\u2014i.e., the rent\u2014will also increase following this update.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By identifying areas of needs within the decentralized data space and systematically addressing them, after more than half a decade of thorough research and development, Swarm distinguishes itself from other solutions through its innovative and multidimensional approach. The loyal community, flourishing ecosystem, and the public, each have their reasons to adopt Swarm: financial rewards of node operators; ease of use of the gateways and light nodes, sophistication and highest programming standards met by the codes, clean protocol architecture, cypherpunk values of the project, are some of the many selling points of this Network.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Swarm Network is now ready to exponentially grow.
