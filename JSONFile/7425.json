Each lot value was estimated in the $20,000 to $30,000 range with no reserve. However, this is likely to be exceeded, with S, Sovereign Individual and BIP39 Seed registering current bid highs of $42,000, $50,000 and $28,000, respectively.","\"The BitcoinShrooms collection is a pixelated recap of the first 13 years of Bitcoin, a homage to the 8-bit style of art that expresses a slight nostalgia for the 90s, a way to soil tens of thousands of SSDs spread across the world with my art (next level cyber-vandalism), a tool to raise awareness about Bitcoin and what I personally view as its core principles, an ironic way to vent at what I see as its annoying pop elements and aberrations,\" Shroomtoshi said about the collection. \"It is a thank you to those I worked with and learned from, to those who are not around anymore but whose names should not be forgotten.\"","The Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207086\/what-are-bitcoin-nfts-ordinals-and-how-do-they-work\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> in January by Casey Rodarmor, offers a new way to store and trade digital content on Bitcoin. By utilizing satoshis, the smallest units of bitcoin, users can engrave NFTs, BRC-20 tokens and other arbitrary data directly onto the blockchain, with each piece becoming a unique, tradeable asset.","While the terms \"Ordinals\" and \"inscriptions\" are often used interchangeably, an ordinal is technically a unique serialized identifier for a single satoshi, and an inscription is the content or data attached to that specific satoshi.","BRC-20-style tokens have also been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266272\/brc-20-style-tokens-are-spreading-to-chains-beyond-bitcoin-but-why?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">spreading to other chains<\/a> in recent weeks, including Ethereum, Solana, Near, Polygon, Celo and Fantom, causing a spike in transactions amid an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266298\/bitcoin-dev-luke-dashjr-calls-inscriptions-spam-community-members-push-back\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ongoing debate<\/a> over the use of inscriptions.","Sotheby's is no stranger to auctioning off NFT collections, having sold Dmitri Cherniak's \"The Goose\" NFT for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235030\/dmitri-cerniaks-the-goose-nft-sold-for-6-5-million-at-sothebys-auction\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$6.2 million<\/a> in June, 37 \"Grails\" NFTs that same month for over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232711\/hedge-fund-3acs-nft-auction-at-sothebys\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$5 million<\/a>, and 500 pieces of \"Themes and Variations\" generative art for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241617\/sothebys-generative-art-auction-nabs-1-2-million-selling-out-in-less-than-an-hour\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$1.2 million<\/a> in July.","However, the auction house found itself on the receiving end of a Bored Apes-MoonPay <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244554\/bored-apes-moonpay-class-action-adds-whistleblower-and-sothebys\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">class action lawsuit<\/a> in August, with Sotheby's accused of misleading people by stating a \"traditional\" art collector purchased 101 Bored Apes for $24.4 million when the buyer was the now defunct crypto exchange FTX.","Crypto hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/254074\/ledger-sothebys-crypto-wallets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">signed<\/a> an \"exclusive\" partnership with the centuries-old auction house in October, offering wallets to Sotheby's top NFT collectors.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
