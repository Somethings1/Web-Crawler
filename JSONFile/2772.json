Coinbase holds a narrower view, suggesting that crypto trades on its platform don't qualify as investment contracts as there\u2019s no contract. The SEC argues for a broader, more flexible interpretation, believing the Howey test should encompass a wide range of securities, including certain crypto assets.","\"No court ever has held a formal contract is a prerequisite,\" the SEC stated in Tuesday\u2019s filing. \"This lawsuit cannot really come as a surprise to Coinbase. It has known all along that a crypto asset bought and sold on its trading platform is a security if it meets the Howey test.\"","Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/iampaulgrewal\/status\/1709317024516817068?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">responded<\/a> on X (formerly Twitter), saying it was more of the \u201Csame old, same old\u201D from the SEC. \u201CThe assets we list on our platform are not securities and are not within the SEC\u2019s jurisdiction. Court decisions over the past several months have made that plain,\u201D he wrote. \u201CThe SEC\u2019s arguments today would mean that everything from Pokemon cards to stamps to Swiftie bracelets are also securities,\u201D Grewal added.","Coinbase asked the judge to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243262\/coinbase-cites-ripple-case-in-motion-to-dismiss-sec-lawsuit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dismiss the case<\/a> in August, citing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235926\/sec-lawsuit-over-whether-xrp-is-a-security-will-go-to-trial\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple\u2019s partial victory<\/a> over the agency \u2014 ruling that XRP sales to retail investors did not break securities laws.
