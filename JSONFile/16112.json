The book audaciously claims that like-minded people scattered across the globe can form new societies first by building communities on the internet and eventually coalescing in real life \u2013 though not necessarily in a single place.","Read more: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022","\u201CA key concept is to go cloud first, land last \u2013 but not land never \u2013 by starting with an online community and then materializing it into the physical world,\u201D Srinivasan writes.","Cryptocurrencies, borderless by nature, would power the economies of these countries-to-be. Once prospective citizens know and trust each other \u2013 early on, those already in close proximity could hold in-person meetups \u2013 they could crowdfund the acquisition or construction of apartments, houses or towns in which to live together. These discontiguous outposts would be stitched together into a \u201Cnetwork archipelago\u201D using \u201Cmixed reality,\u201D a combination of virtual reality, augmented reality (e.g., glasses that superimpose text or graphics over what\u2019s in front of your nose) and face-to-face interactions. Digital IDs would confer citizenship and a census would be taken (how else?) on-chain. Ultimately, a network state would seek diplomatic recognition from the analog-world governments Srinivasan depicts as sclerotic.","Some readers may be thinking, \u201CWhat is this man smoking?\u201D But there are at least two projects, Praxis Society and Afropolitan, trying to make this apparent sci-fi dream into a reality. (Srinivasan is an investor in both.)","Read more: Balaji Srinivasan, the Man Who Called COVID (2020)","In 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic put much of the world on lockdown, Afropolitan formed an online community of 200,000 people in less than six months, according to co-founder Chika Uwazie. (They initially convened on Clubhouse, the voice-based social network that was briefly popular before Twitter Spaces ate its lunch.) The group raised \u201Cmillions of dollars\u201D in bitcoin and fiat currency from members of the diaspora of Nigerians living in the U.S., Europe and Latin America, Uwazie said during a presentation in October at CoinDesk\u2019s I.D.E.A.S. conference in New York. (The group supplemented that with a $2.1 million pre-seed round this year from Srinivasan and other angel investors.)","A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Afropolitan aspires to build \u201Ca pan-African network state to help 1 billion Africans live their most abundant lives,\u201D something it says the world\u2019s nation-states have failed to do. But during her talk, Uwazie tailored her message to the investor crowd.","Unlike a social network, which needs millions of users to turn a profit, a network state could produce a return to investors with only a few hundred thousand members, Uwazie claimed. Revenue would come from \u201Cphysical and e-resident taxes,\u201D according to one of her slides.","\u201CThe network state is its own emerging asset,\u201D she said. \u201CIt actually could be quite profitable.\u201D","If nothing else, Srinivasan\u2019s book is sparking conversations. As of mid-November, \u201CThe Network State\u201D ranked third among Amazon\u2019s bestsellers in the general technology and reference category, fourth in political philosophy ebooks and 16th in political philosophy books overall."],"entity":[{"type":"Network State","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Praxis Society","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Uwazie","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"\u201Cmillions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Amazon","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Latin America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New Country","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Balaji Srinivasan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2.1 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Clubhouse","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk\u2019s I.D.E.A.S.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chika Uwazie","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Andreessen Horowitz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Srinivasan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Most Influential","Most Influential 2022","Balaji Srinivasan"],"authors":["Marc Hochstein"]}
