Here&#x27;s how.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/225356\/opensea-secondary-share-sales","publishDate":"2023-04-08T04:27:45","id":10663,"type":null,"title":"How shareholders are selling OpenSea stock despite restrictions","category":["DEALS"],"content":["NFT marketplace OpenSea is a privately held startup that was last valued at $13.3 billion when it raised $300 million in early 2022. Like many prized startups, OpenSea does not permit sales of its shares by staff or investors without sign-off from the board.","And yet in one obscure corner of the startup investment space, OpenSea stock can be found on offer at steep discounts. So too are the shares of many of the crypto sector\u2019s blue-chip companies, as The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/217937\/opensea-consensys-among-prized-crypto-startups-with-shares-available-at-big-discounts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> in March.","How is this possible? The answer is that brokerage platforms are skirting restrictions on stock trading through the use of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) \u2014 bespoke legal entities set up purely to facilitate secondary market transactions.","\u201CEven where a private company restricts trading in its stock, it may still be possible for investors to buy and sell indirect interests in that company\u2019s stock by trading the ownership interest of an SPV that, in turn, owns the private company\u2019s stock,\u201D said Nick Fusco, founder and CEO of ApeVue, a data provider focused on pre-IPO companies.","The workaround is the source of some tension between startups and their shareholders.","The beleaguered state of the crypto and indeed global markets over the past year has weighed heavily on startup valuations. In Oct. 2022, Blockchain.com was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-10-26\/blockchain-com-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-shrunken-valuation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reportedly<\/a> in talks about raising money at a valuation of $3-4 billion, down from $14 billion just six months earlier. Beyond crypto, Swedish buy-now-pay-later giant Klarna saw its valuation <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/11\/klarna-confirms-800m-raise-as-valuation-drops-85-to-6-7b\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fall 85%<\/a> when it raised $800 million in July last year.","Some well-capitalized startups, however, have weathered the market downturn without needing to raise more money, avoiding the dreaded \u201Cdown round\u201D \u2014 which involves raising money at a valuation lower than in previous rounds. Down rounds can hurt startups both in terms of optics and because they\u2019re demoralizing for staff, whose share options are suddenly worth less.","But secondary market platforms like Forge Global offer another barometer for the value of startup equity. Through them, investors and employees have a means to mark-to-market their shares.","OpenSea is a prime example. The category-defining NFT company has so far managed to avoid raising money in the bear market. Yet as of March 5, OpenSea shares were trading at a 51% discount on Birel, a secondary market platform for startup shares.","The chart below, based on data collected by ApeVue, paints a picture of how the secondary market for OpenSea shares has evolved since Jan. 2022. It\u2019s based on data taken from institution-focused brokers of unlisted equity.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apevue.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ApeVue<\/a><\/span>","OpenSea has forbidden unsanctioned secondary sales since March 2021. An excerpt of the bylaws of the corporate entity behind OpenSea, Ozone Networks, Inc., obtained by The Block, states, \u201CA stockholder shall not transfer (as such term is defined below) any shares of the corporation\u2019s stock (or any rights of or interest in such shares) to any person unless such transfer is approved by the board of directors prior to such transfer, which approval may be granted or withheld in the board of directors\u2019 sole and absolute discretion.\u201D","Such restrictions are by no means unusual. \u201CThis is already the norm. Many companies do not want deals in the secondary market, so they prohibit it,\u201D said Birel\u2019s CEO Richard Freemanson.&nbsp;","\u201CWe have OpenSea holders who are interested in an exit. In order to make sure the deal won\u2019t be blocked by the company, sellers offer allocations via SPV, and rarely through forward contracts. It\u2019s common practice in secondary market,\u201D Freemanson added.","It is not exactly clear how OpenSea or other startups in the same position feel about the state of play. OpenSea did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","At least some investors, however, see it as far from ideal. One person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that 95% of OpenSea shares trading on secondary markets take the form of SPVs, with each lot attached to its own entity. This fragments liquidity and hinders trading, they said.&nbsp;","Another investor, a founder and angel investor in fintech firms, said investors would prefer to buy shares directly, as SPVs come with additional fees and less control. \u201CYou\u2019re one step removed from the actual investment, which just really isn\u2019t ideal,\u201D they added.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
