Their support of Apple Pay is a huge plus for our iOS users,\u201D Charles Hamel, head of crypto at Opera, told The Block.","The fees charged by Wyre are \u201Cextremely competitive\u201D and are $0.30 + 2.9% per transaction, an Opera spokesperson person told The Block.","The new feature is available for Opera\u2019s all three browsers: Android, iOS browser Opera Touch, and desktop browser.","\u201CUsers can purchase as little as $1 worth of crypto, and there is a maximum daily limit of $250,\u201D the spokesperson person told The Block. \u201CAs our browser-based wallet is focused around the usage of cryptocurrencies on the web and using dApps [decentralized applications], we expect the vast majority of transactions will not hit that limit.\u201D","Opera said Wyre\u2019s solution helps users buy bitcoin and ether in \u201Cless than 30 seconds\u201D as compared to \"hours or days\" via some crypto exchanges.&nbsp;","Notably, Opera already supports the feature for the <a href=\"https:\/\/press.opera.com\/2019\/02\/06\/opera-crypto-top-up\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Scandinavian countries<\/a> - Norway, Sweden, and Denmark - since February 2019.
