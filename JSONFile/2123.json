This would be separate from the team\u2019s existing zkEVM, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222950\/polygon-labs-unveils-zkevm-layer-2-scaling-solution\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rolled out<\/a> in March 2023.","Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, clarified the distinction between the proposed and existing zkEVM technologies. Speaking with The Block, he stated, \u201CThis is an upgrade of the Polygon PoS chain to a zkEVM \u2018Validium.\u2019 That means the data availability [for apps] will be with the validators, whereas the existing zkEVM rollup has data availability directly on Ethereum.\u201D","Polygon Labs indicated that it envisions both the upgraded Polygon PoS and the existing zkEVM coexisting within the Polygon ecosystem. If approved, the upgrade could be implemented on the mainnet by the end of 2024.","If accepted by the community, the upgrade will mark the first time that an existing chain has added ZK proofs and transitioned to become an L2. Polygon is currently one of the most widely used blockchains in the crypto sector in terms of daily transactions and holds over $2 billion in on-chain assets.","Â© 2023 The Block.
