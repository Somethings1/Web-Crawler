They're just not. So our systems are designed to take risk off, like sell along, or buy to cover a short if the market goes against us. So if we're long, the market goes against us to some pre-programed amount\u2026 the systems will take risk off so that if the market becomes more extreme, we've protected our investors capital.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although nearly $500 billion dollars has been wiped from the total crypto market cap so far in June, Green believes the severity of this correction has likely been exacerbated by crypto\u2019s reflexive nature.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As Green explains, \u201CIt's highly likely that digital assets are the fastest reacting to changes in inflation and interest rate expectations, and fast-reacting things often overshoot and then pull back.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While crypto\u2019s volatility often draws the ire of critics who do not believe it to be a viable alternative to the current financial system, Green thinks it is important to remember is still a new technology:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think we have to remember \u2014 and we all do in the industry \u2014 but people outside the industry have to remember that [crypto] fundamentally\u2026 is an early stage technology.
