A majority of respondents said they wanted those disclosures on a quarterly or monthly basis, with some variance depending on the information.","Those disclosures, which parallel what public companies provide, ranked ahead of more crypto-centric information like tokenomics of the network as information market participants said they want. The report found that \u201Cfactors like tokenomics and perspective of the core team were viewed by investors across all three countries as relatively unimportant as compared to other factors like the financial overview, risks, and management.\u201D","\u201CPerhaps the most striking feature of the results is that the more crypto-specific elements of crypto-related investment tend to be the data elements investors prioritize the least. In other words, the issues with the most overlap with familiar traditional financial disclosure concepts \u2014 financial information, risk factors, management \u2014 are, not surprisingly, emphasized by investors and prospective investors of crypto assets,\u201D the report adds.","Most participants \u2013 65% \u2013 viewed crypto assets as a long-term investment, while over 40% were interested in frequent trading (participants could select multiple options). Less than one in five respondents said they use digital assets for applications. Unsurprisingly bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency and largest by market capitalization, was the most popular investment. Over 70% of respondents said they held the digital currency.","In the U.S., the country with the largest sample of participants in the survey, 50% of respondents said they wanted monthly or quarterly updates, while another 27% said they wanted information updates \u201Cas changes occur.\u201D Respondents in Canada and the UK largely agreed, with slightly fewer saying they wanted quarterly or monthly updates, and approximately the same number saying they wanted updates on projects as changes occur.","Increased disclosures are at the center of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s belief that most digital assets are securities, requiring financial disclosures and prospectuses for investors. Token issuers and exchanges have argued that the current rules, which exist largely to provide regular disclosures to investors, are too onerous and don\u2019t account for the possible utility of a token beyond pure investment.","Another takeaway from the survey was that \u201CCrypto Twitter\u201D was not an important source of information for most of those who responded despite \u201Cperceived dominance.\u201D Only 26.3% of respondents cited social media as a source of information for their crypto investments.","Concepts like financial overviews and management weigh more heavily on investor decision making than tokenomics and a crypto asset\u2019s underlying network,\u201D the report says.","White papers, the standard disclosure document for crypto tokens, \u201Cwere rarely referenced as important sources of data and information,\u201D with investors typically preferring \u201Cold-fashioned websites and traditional institutions like centralized exchanges and brokers for their information.\u201D&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
