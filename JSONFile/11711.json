Storonsky confirmed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/revolut-ceo-eyes-expansion-into-mortgages-crypto-wallets-2022-04-26\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">earlier reports<\/a> that the financial app will add staking, deposits and withdrawals, and lending to its custodial wallet offering.","The non-custodial wallet will function both as a separate standalone app and as an option within the Revolut in-app hub, where a plethora of features from pet insurance to hotel booking to remittances are already available.&nbsp;","There are plans to add support for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the wallet but this is currently \"deprioritized,\" according to the Revolut founder.","\"We want to start with the basics,\" he said.&nbsp;","Giving further details into how the wallet will look, the billionaire Revolut founder said that while it will function similarly to MetaMask, he wants to make it as simple as possible for the user. That means the complexity of different blockchain networks and bridges that some crypto-native wallets make visible will be hidden.&nbsp;","\"We want to make sure that people can just transfer crypto in the same way they do with bank accounts,\" he explained.&nbsp;","He did note, however, that it will likely initially launch as a single-chain wallet.&nbsp;","\"Initially we'll launch on Ethereum but going forward after that we will make it multichain,\" he says, with Revcoin following a similar trajectory.","When asked if the above details were a direct confirmation of Revolut's plans for a native token, Storonsky remained coy.&nbsp;","\"We're working on many things,\" he said, adding that it will be launched \"hopefully one day\".&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
