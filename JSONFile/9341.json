It was the kind of innovative hardware that was designed to disrupt the world of wearables just as AirPods and Fitbit had before it.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The startup was led by a seasoned team -- husband and wife co-founders who were both already veteran entrepreneurs, having sold their first company with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2011\/04\/19\/tagged-buys-popular-socialinstant-messaging-client-digsby\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fanfare<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. Originally, the couple wanted to develop a cryptocurrency wallet, but they quickly pivoted to the wearable business in early 2017. The third co-founder, Eric Mogil, spent six years at Michael Kors as its top technologist before joining the wearable technology enterprise.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It has now been two years since the pivot to and debut of the promised identity product, the wearable Token ring.

They were promised \"a more accurate timeline...as soon as we can,\" per an email update sent to customers dated December 2018.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, a detailed timeline was finally published only recently by Token CEO Melanie Shapiro after The Block repeatedly sent requests for comments to the company.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In a Medium post, Melanie Shapiro <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/tokenring\/the-path-to-releasing-token-139676fa5809\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recounted<\/a> the production journey of the rings.

The co-founding couple touted their pedigrees as Rochester Institute of Technology grads, with Melanie leading Token as the CEO and Steve serving as CTO.

According to sources familiar with the matter, after Shapiro left, his responsibilities were divided between Mogil and the vice president of engineering Richard Lourette.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meanwhile, the Rochester-based engineering team, which mainly consisted of recent college graduates, continued to miss production deadlines and was not able to launch the rings on schedule, according to sources familiar with the matter.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C[Steve] was brilliant, and we really missed him when he left, even after people took over the better-defined functions of his role,\u201D said a person close to the matter. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Steve Shapiro\u2019s departure looks to have been followed by a reshuffle of Token\u2019s leadership team. Around the same time that Steve left, the firm\u2019s director of engineering Dan Gill also left the company.

In June, Blockchange Ventures' managing partner and board member of Token, Ken Seiff, filed a lawsuit against the company, demanding it to disclose its financial statements.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Seiff alleged that a \u201Cdirector and officer\u201D of Token has used over $37,500 of company funds to cover a personal tax bill and a personal vacation.
