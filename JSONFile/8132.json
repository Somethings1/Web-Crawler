You buy an NFT or you do something in crypto and for a few hundred thousand dollars you get tens of millions of dollars of mainstream press. The second reason, which is probably the major reason for the ones who want to build products, is they want to try it out\u2026 if you\u2019re going to build a product in NFTs, you have to own one.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Indeed, institutional interest in developing NFT products is accelerating.
