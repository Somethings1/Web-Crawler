Months ago, Bankruptcy Court Judge Martin Glenn warned \u201Cregulatory roadblocks\u201D could plague the sale of Celsius much like it thwarted a fellow lender\u2019s acquisition. In April, crypto exchange Binance.US abruptly terminated its purchase of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager\u2019s $1 billion in assets after federal officials appealed the sale, citing the \"hostile and uncertain regulatory climate\" in the U.S.","Celsius filed for bankruptcy last July after cratering crypto prices triggered a bank-run style rush of withdrawals that exposed the platform\u2019s profound liquidity issues. The exchange\u2019s implosion was a harbinger of things to come for the crypto industry, which later saw the collapse of several other high profile crypto exchanges, lenders and venture capital firms that plunged the industry into a deep winter.","Read more: Fahrenheit Consortium Is Lead Bidder in Bankruptcy Auction for Celsius Assets","Edited by Sandali Handagama."],"entity":[{"type":"Martin Glenn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"US Bitcoin Corp","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Blockchain Recovery Investment Consortium","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Crypto consortium Fahrenheit","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$500 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"winter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Arrington Capital and miner US Bitcoin Corp","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"$450","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"GXD Labs LLC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Van Eck Absolute Return Advisers Corporation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Sandali Handagama","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Celsius","Bankruptcy"],"authors":["Jack Schickler","Elizabeth Napolitano"]}
