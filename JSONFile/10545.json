This mistake could have been avoided if the marketplace were to auto-add a zero in front of a bid with a decimal point as its first character, they said. They also suggested disabling the bid button when the bid price exceeds the collection's floor price.&nbsp;","\"We originally considered the bid mistake to be a user error because there was no bug in the product per see,\" Blur wrote in a thread on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/blur_io\/status\/1600720732241399809?s=46&amp;t=Uoyjlh0VACb7hzed1sxwGA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a>.&nbsp;\"After evaluating further, we see how this can be considered a bug from the user\u2019s perspective, so we will refund 50% to traders who were affected by this UI behavior.\"&nbsp;","\"Specifically, we will query for collection bids that were accepted over 25% of the non-flagged floor and refund them automatically,\" the team added. \"We'll do this within the next 10 days (likely sooner).\"&nbsp;","Blur launched mid-October to much fanfare from the NFT community \u2014 muscling in on an increasingly competitive market corner. The move to refund fat-fingered traders comes just days following the platform's second airdrop to its users.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/nft-marketplace-monthly-volume\/embed\" title=\"NFT Marketplace Monthly Volume\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
