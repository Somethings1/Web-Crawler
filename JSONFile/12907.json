Flow provides developers with a powerful, user-friendly platform built for usability. This integration further empowers developers to create scalable applications by leveraging Flow's unique multi-role architecture, resource-oriented programming language, developer ergonomics, and consumer onboarding capabilities.<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Trusted by world-class brands such as the NFL, NBA, Ticketmaster, and Mattel, Flow offers a mobile-ready infrastructure, user-centric account model, and frictionless onboarding \u2014 making it an ideal choice for developers seeking to create applications with a seamless user experience across platforms. QuickNode's support for Flow will empower developers to build innovative, beautiful dApps, taking advantage of Flow's features while benefiting from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quicknode.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">QuickNode's robust infrastructure<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">QuickNode's integration with Flow is a significant milestone for our blockchain infrastructure ecosystem, as it provides developers with a scalable and user-friendly protocol for building next-generation consumer applications. With collaborations and projects, such as NBA Top Shot, CryptoKitties, Ubisoft, and Warner Music Group, it is undoubtedly helping drive mainstream adoption of blockchain technology,<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\" said Dmitry Shklovsky, QuickNode Co-founder and Co-CEO.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">From the start, Flow was designed for building consumer-scale decentralized applications. Its unique multi-node architecture enables the network to scale without sharding or reducing decentralization by separating the roles of validator nodes into Collection, Consensus, Execution, and Verification. This approach allows for thousands of times higher throughput and lower costs while maintaining atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) transactions \u2014 ensuring a positive user experience and full composability for developers.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Flow also features familiar and accessible onboarding that introduces mainstream users to Web3 in phases, and it provides the right infrastructure for building mobile-first experiences to appeal to consumers.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Flow is developer-friendly at its core. Its resource-oriented programming language, Cadence, is designed specifically for making smart contract development faster and more secure. Cadence's strong, static type system minimizes runtime errors, while its pre- and post-conditions enforce expected behavior, making the language easier to learn, audit, and use. At the same time, Flow\u2019s developer ergonomics enable upgradeable smart contracts and built-in logging support.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By supporting Flow, QuickNode is helping to pave the way for a new generation of games, apps, and the digital assets that power them.
