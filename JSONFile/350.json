The SEC\u2019s rejection of several spot bitcoin ETFs this fall, Valyrie\u2019s and VanEck\u2019s being the most recent, highlights the challenges facing crypto exchange-traded products in the U.S. The SEC has repeatedly cited its concern over the potential for market manipulation as the reason for spurning applications.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While market manipulation is a legitimate concern, and there is no debate about the need for investor protections, the SEC\u2019s reasoning misses the mark. A financial product built on top of bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is part of a greater transformational shift that is already underway, where the most distributed and secure ledger ever created will drive investors, managers, auditors and regulators to reimagine what is possible. Assurance tools to provide data transparency and financial insight on-demand and in real-time will be commonplace and have already been proven by Armanino\u2019s ability to report on more than $28 billion of crypto-asset-backed instruments in real-time. These tools meet and exceed the SEC\u2019s mission to provide financial transparency as a key component of consumer protection.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One important case in point: CoinShares\u2019 XBT product. Launched in 2015, the <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">XBT Provider Tracker note<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, traded on NASDAQ in Europe, has parallels to a spot BTC ETF in that the asset manager needs to maintain a hedge of the underlying assets in such a way that the notes are adequately backed, even with volatile daily market price changes. In 2020, CoinShares took the bold step of becoming the only publicly listed asset manager to offer real-time visibility into liabilities and assets through Armanino\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.armaninollp.com\/industries\/crypto-digital-assets\/?utm_campaign=blockchain-crypto-digital-assets-trustexplorer-2111-wc21373851&amp;utm_medium=paid-advertising&amp;utm_source=third-party-newsletter-the-block\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TrustExplorer Real-Time Attest<\/span><\/a> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">t<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">echnology.

Over the same time period, the largest ETF products have produced only a handful of reports.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, ETFs available for commodities such as gold, rare metals, or income-producing assets like real property are far more opaque to markets, regulators and investors than a spot bitcoin ETF would be. With on-demand attest over the underlying assets and note obligations, there is simply no match. A bitcoin futures ETF is a better-than-nothing start, but the spot ETF, supported by Real-Time Attest, will usher in a new era of financial products built on transparent foundations and auditability to support customer protection, market protection and well-informed capital formation.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For questions or to learn more, contact our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.armaninollp.com\/industries\/crypto-digital-assets\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Digital Assets &amp; Blockchain team<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Follow us on Twitter at: @ArmaninoCrypto<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
