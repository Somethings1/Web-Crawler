With appreciation for the Third Circuit, later today we'll again seek its help by challenging the SEC\u2019s abdication of its duty.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase and the SEC have butted heads since the exchange asked for new rules in 2022. Grewal noted that <\/span>Republican SEC Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda disagreed with the denial and pointed to a need for dialogue between regulators and the crypto industry.&nbsp;","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We're grateful that two Commissioners disagreed with the denial and called for real dialogue,\" Grewal said. \"We should be working together to create laws and rules that will benefit consumers and U.S. innovation, not defending lawsuits based on legal positions that change month after month.\"<\/span>","Later on Friday, Coinbase <a href=\"https:\/\/ecf.ca3.uscourts.gov\/n\/beam\/servlet\/TransportRoom\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> its petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \u2014 meaning the exchange is asking the court to assess whether or not the SEC's move to deny its petition for rulemaking was proper.&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Coinbase\u2019s mandamus petition thus has now achieved its stated purpose of compelling the SEC to act on Coinbase\u2019s request for rulemaking,\" according to the filing. \"The Commission\u2019s formal denial of that request makes explicit what its words and actions had long shown was the Commission\u2019s position. By doing so, the SEC has cleared the path for judicial review that its unexplained inaction had long obstructed.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The agency has not proposed crypto specific rules, but has put forward some rulemakings over the past year that would apply to the industry. <\/span><span class=\"s5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For example, the SEC reopened a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/211786\/sec-to-vote-on-rule-that-would-tighten-crypto-custody-requirements\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s6\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">custody<\/span><\/a> rule that would require registered investment advisors to keep crypto with a qualified custodian, and require those custodians to follow certain requirements.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC has also taken enforcement actions over the past year, including against Coinbase for operating as an unregistered exchange, which is ongoing.
