Halliday, who will soon leave the business, took over roughly a year ago <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177012\/kraken-poaches-geminis-head-of-uk-to-run-its-uk-operations\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">after joining from a similar role at Gemini<\/a>, a rival exchange.&nbsp;","Das previously ran Unblock, a crypto payments gateway startup, and a small business finance platform named FIBR UK. He also spent a year as head of operations strategy and scaling at Starling Bank, the British neobank founded by Anne Boden and backed by Bahamas-based billionaire Harald McPike.&nbsp;","In his new role, Das will oversee Kraken\u2019s efforts to build out its business in the UK, where it boasts 275 staff and a substantial client base, according to today\u2019s announcement. The firm is registered with the FCA as a cryptoasset exchange and custodian wallet provider, in addition to holding authorizations linked to its derivatives and benchmarking units. The exchange claims to account for 50% of GBP spot trading volume in crypto.&nbsp;","\u201CIt\u2019s very important,\u201D Das said of the UK market. \u201CIt\u2019s one of our strongest and biggest markets and even in the market that we\u2019re in today volumes have stayed relatively consistent.\u201D&nbsp;","Das\u2019s appointment comes at a precarious time for UK crypto firms, thanks to new marketing restrictions that have disrupted offshore exchanges, in particular. The enhanced regime has already <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252526\/bybit-suspends-services-uk-after-ceo-ben-zhou-said-exit-likely\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">prompted Bybit to suspend its UK operations<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/257721\/binance-to-temporarily-stop-accepting-new-uk-users-after-fca-restriction\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">while Binance has been forced to pause onboarding new customers<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;","But Das said Kraken is well-placed to navigate the stricter regime.&nbsp;","\u201CWe\u2019ve been working with the regulators to come to a position where we feel now that it\u2019s time for the next chapter. We can start to build upon all of the things that\u2019ve been laid out,\u201D he said.&nbsp;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
