Two months removed from The Merge, Ethereum is still playing catch-up with more mature staking networks like Cosmos and Polkadot, but Kraken\u2019s Tim Ogilvie thinks that\u2019s about to change.","\u201CIt\u2019s going to just be an absolute rocket ship as you get closer and closer to when withdrawals are enabled,\u201D Ogilvie, Kraken\u2019s Head of Staked, told The Block in an interview, adding that a big transition will be seen as \u201Ca huge number of assets are likely to get staked over the course of the next six to nine months.\u201D","When Ogilvie started Staked at Kraken five years ago, a number of questions about staking remained unanswered in terms of security and whether the mechanism would work. In the last quarter the industry saw $63 billion assets staked, generating $5 billion in annuitized rewards, according to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/6693156.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net\/hubfs\/6693156\/State%20of%20Staking%20Q3%202022%20by%20Staked_Kraken%20(1).pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">company report<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/ethereum\/ethereum-share-of-transaction-fee-from-total-miner-revenue-monthly\/embed\" title=\"Ethereum Transaction Fee % of Total Block Validator Revenue\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Staking revenue percentages on Ethereum have climbed since the network's change in consensus models, data from The Block Research show.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The growth in the staking market took years to cultivate. Initial participants grappled over unknowns regarding returns and exact parameters on when staked assets would become available again, if ever. These factors, conflated with risks associated with a potentially exploited smart contract that might be either locked or drained by a hacker, made it difficult for anyone to stake 100% of their assets outside of die-hard crypto natives, Ogilvie said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Driven by confidence in PoS following the success of The Merge, Ogilvie\u2019s conversations in retail and institutional circles now reveal excitement. \u201CYou know, Kraken has a big retail base that uses the customer offering. Staked and Kraken both have a lot of big institutional clients,\u201D he said, noting that on both sides of the coin, \u201Ceverybody's fired up about ETH.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For an ecosystem closely watching the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX empire, staking may be even more attractive, said Ogilvie.
