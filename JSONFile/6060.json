Central to his appearance was his push to bring crypto \u201Cinto the regulatory fold.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In other words, that means bringing crypto spot markets under the CFTC\u2019s oversight. The CFTC\u2019s current oversight is largely limited to futures and derivatives markets. Within spot markets, the CFTC can prosecute fraud and manipulation, which Behnam says that the commission has done remarkably well.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, Behnam lamented the lack of information available to the CFTC. \u201CIn essence, this is an unregulated market,\u201D he said to Ag Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI). \u201CThere is so much we are not able to see because of this limited authority.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During his confirmation hearing, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/122238\/nominee-for-cftc-chair-asks-congress-to-make-agency-the-primary-cop-on-the-beat-for-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Behnam made a similar appeal<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, but at the time would not confirm to The Block that he was asking for a true regulatory regime. However, today, he clearly compared the proposed shift to the expansion of CFTC over swap markets as a result of Dodd-Frank.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stabenow asked, \u201Cdoes the CFTC have the resources necessary to take on this additional responsibility with respect to the digital asset market?\u201D<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe short answer is no,\u201D answered Behnam, proposing a massive expansion. While saying he didn\u2019t have an exact dollar amount, he referenced the boost in the CFTC\u2019s operating budget from roughly $200 million to $300 million following Dodd-Frank, noting that a similar $100 million boost would be a rough ballpark.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$100 million would represent a 30% increase compared to the CFTC\u2019s requested operating <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cftc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2021-05\/CFTC_FY_2022_President_s_Budget_Final_Signed_05212021.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">budget<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> of $332 million for 2022.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) drove the point home further, asking \u201CAre there parallels with Dodd-Frank?\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s a perfect example and a perfect analogy,\u201D said Behnam.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">John Boozman (R-AR), the committee\u2019s leading Republican, also seemed comfortable with the CFTC expanding into crypto spot markets. His primary concern was in limiting that expansion to crypto, without fueling \u201Cmission creep\u201D into other cash commodities.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI couldn\u2019t agree with you more. I don\u2019t mean to suggest at all that this should be the start of the CFTC\u2019s role in other cash commodities,\u201D said Behnam. \u201CThis particular market is so unique because of the retail-facing element.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/127758\/us-senate-confirms-new-cftc-chair\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ag Committee confirming him in December<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, this is the first time Behnam has testified since, illustrating that digital assets \u201Care at the front and center of our thinking at the Commission,\u201D as he put it.&nbsp;<\/span>","Potentially limiting this expansion is the CFTC's relative authority over the Securities and Exchange Commission, which answers to separate congressional committees.","SEC Chair Gensler has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/118226\/sec-chair-gary-gensler-says-he-wants-to-clean-up-crypto-before-a-spill\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">similarly talked of bringing crypto exchanges<\/a> \"into the public policy framework.\" Gensler has also indicated that cryptocurrency exchanges may already be securities exchanges, though the SEC has been hesitant to act on that proposition.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
