The often derided CEO changed his Facebook profile picture to one with him wearing the new headset.&nbsp;","After spending the early portion of the presentation reveling in the \u201Csocial shift\u201D occurring within Meta\u2019s version of the metaverse \u2014 Zuckerberg and his team saying the top apps on the Quest store are social ones \u2014 the pre-recorded video\u2019s focus turned towards aligning with and appealing to enterprise clients potentially less concerned with a heftier price tag. The new headsets costs more than three times the Meta Quest 2, which has a $399 price tag.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: Meta presentation screenshot<\/em>","\u201CThis is a high-end device designed for work and people who want the best experience we can build today,\u201D said Zuckerberg. \u201CWe\u2019ve built Quest Pro to be the best device we can make for getting things done.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nMeta announced strategic partnerships with Microsoft, Accenture and Zoom.","The new headset, apparently primed for taking remote work to the next level, comes with features like a \u201Cworkplace\u201D charging dock and controllers that can also be used as markers for writing on virtual whiteboards. Other technological advancements, like facial tracking, will enable users to power avatars capable of more closely mirroring their emotions and expressions when communicating in virtual spaces.","Meta partnering with software giant Microsoft was likely the biggest announcement. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CWe knew early on that we wanted this to be a good device for getting work done,\u201D added Zuckerberg. \u201CWorking with Microsoft is a big part of making that happen.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: Meta presentation screenshot<\/em>","Microsoft will in part make it possible for workers to access both Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 while using their Meta headset, allowing users to meet up with coworkers or work solo in a virtual space.","\u201CAt Microsoft we\u2019re incredibly excited about the metaverse and how digital and physical worlds are coming together and transforming everything [including] the way we do work,\u201D Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the presentation.","Meta also revealed it had partnered with global consulting firm Accenture which will aid in orchestrating large-scale virtual events. Accenture CEO Julie Sweet, who mentioned her firm has been working with Microsoft on virtual work solutions since 2019, says Accenture has \u201Cdeployed\u201D 60,000 Meta Quest 2 headsets.","Ahead of Connect, IDC senior analyst Tom Mainelli said if Meta could strike \u201Cpartnerships with other big tech companies\u201D it would represent a positive step forward after a year that has seen the company\u2019s market capitalization drop by more than $600 billion; Zuckerberg's personal fortune simultaneously plummeting.","Meta did not say how many people are currently using its headsets to access its flagship social network Horizon Worlds. In February, the company said virtual social network had hit 300,000 users.","As of June of this year, Meta had sold nearly 15 million units of its Meta Quest 2 VR headset, making it the best-selling device of its kind, according to IDC research analyst Francisco Jeronimo.","Meta\u2019s metaverse division, Reality Labs, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/173839\/metas-zuckerberg-warns-of-hiring-freeze-restructuring-plans-bloomberg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">posted losses<\/a> of nearly $3 billion in the second quarter of this year.","The company\u2019s metaverse executive Vishal Shah, who appeared in today's presentation alongside Zuckerberg, recently lamented that Meta employee engagement with Horizon Worlds has so far appeared apathetic while complaints from \u201Ccreators, users, [and] playtesters\u201D suggests the platform was neither \u201Cusable\u201D or \u201Cwell crafted,\u201D according to a leaked memo published by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2022\/10\/6\/23391895\/meta-facebook-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-too-buggy-leaked-memo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Verge<\/a>.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IDC's Mainelli says Meta\u2019s huge market share of the VR hardware market may give it a leg up on the competition but success could still be hard to come by. \u201C[M]ost IT Decision Makers don\u2019t really think of Meta as an enterprise-focused company, yet,\u201D he said. \u201CThe way forward in commercial could be quite challenging.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nMoving forward, whether in the corporate or consumer spheres, public sentiment could play a role in how successful Meta ultimately is marketing its version of the metaverse.
