For example, investors are demanding the ability to take their assets off exchange and move positions from one platform to another or to earn income when their assets are lent to someone else. They seek true transparency in markets that have grown too complacent with opaque corners. They request fractional ownership and the ability to trade assets 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Digital securities, to all intents and purposes, have been expressly built with this new generation of Gen Z investors in mind.

To enable this significant leap forward, the company spent over 950 days working with the SEC and its advisors to craft a security that appealed to regulators, investors and issuers alike. This resulted in the first fully-registered security token IPO on the blockchain.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Declared effective in August 2020, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/securities.inx.co\/hello\/?utm_source=theblock&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=jan31#\/signup\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">INX Token<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> serves as an example of how a digital security can be structured for retail investors.

If your platform or exchange bans you from buying or selling, simply remove your digital security and trade it elsewhere, even peer to peer.
