According to the authors, a DoS attack has never been successfully executed against a prominent cryptocurrency system. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Before the new research, it was thought this would require that the attacker obtain at least <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/79206\/mit-pool-detective-blockchains\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">51% of the network\u2019s mining capacity<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to the researchers, the BDoS attack they\u2019ve discovered would theoretically be able to \u201Cgrind (Bitcoin\u2019s) blockchain to a halt with significantly fewer resources\u201D \u2014 as little as 21% of the network\u2019s mining power (as of March 2020).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The attack works by targeting the system\u2019s reward system in a way that discourages miner participation.
