Elizabeth Warren slammed troubled crypto exchange FTX as \u201Cnot much more than a handful of magic beans,\u201D during a Senate Banking Committee hearing.","The committee is considering President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Acting Chair Martin Gruenberg to serve as chair of the agency.","Contagion spreading through the crypto industry could have been worse if federally-insured banks were \u201Cdangerously intertwined\u201D with crypto, according to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.","Warren laid into the crypto industry during a Senate Banking Committee hearing, slamming troubled crypto exchange FTX as \u201Cnot much more than a handful of magic beans.\u201D The hearing focused on several Biden administration nominees, including Martin Gruenberg, the acting chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Biden nominated Gruenberg to serve as chair of the agency.","\u201COur banks stayed safe even as crypto imploded because many of President Biden's regulators, like Acting Chairman Gruenberg, fought to keep crypto from becoming dangerously intertwined with our banks. And he did this despite the Trump administration's and crypto boosters\u2019 aggressive efforts to bring crypto and all its risks into traditional banking,\u201D Warren said.","Washington lawmakers and regulators are taking a closer look at crypto after the FTX catastrophe. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware earlier this month, sending a shockwave through the industry. Crypto lender BlockFi recently filed for bankruptcy protection, citing its exposure to FTX.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Warren pressed Gruenberg on whether the banking system would be \u201Cless safe\u201D if FDIC-insured banks were fully involved in the crypto market. Warren\u2019s examples included if banks held FTX tokens on their balance sheets or accepted crypto tokens as collateral for loans.","\u201CI would think so,\u201D Gruenberg said. \u201CThe evidence is clear now. We had companies that were engaging in highly speculative activity, highly leveraged and vulnerable to a loss of confidence in a run. They did not have direct exposures to the insured financial institutions and as a result the failure of those firms was really limited to the crypto space.\u201D","The Massachusetts Democrat warned that integrating \u201Ctoxic crypto assets\u201D into the banking system in the future could cost taxpayers money.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CSome industry boosters still argue that these toxic crypto assets should be more integrated into the real banking system, which would mean that the next time crypto stumbles, taxpayers would be on the hook to bail out these banks,\u201D Warren said. \u201CNo thanks on that one.\u201D","Senate Democrats have raised similar concerns about SoFi\u2019s crypto arm, warning in a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/188931\/senators-warn-of-sofi-consumer-risks-amid-crypto-crash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter<\/span><\/a> that taxpayers could be forced to bail out the firm if it faces a crisis. SoFi received Federal Reserve approval to be a bank holding company and be treated as a financial holding company earlier this year, on the condition that it divest SoFi Digital Assets or conform its activities to the law in two years.","Later in the hearing, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., the top Republican on the committee, came to the industry's defense.","\u201CI think there\u2019s a danger that some of us confuse bad behavior by individual people with the instruments they use to conduct their bad behavior. There is nothing that I\u2019m aware of \u2014 and I\u2019ve studied this pretty closely \u2014 about what happened with FTX that requires us to blame crypto,\u201D Toomey said.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
