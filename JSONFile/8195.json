A Luna holder can always swap $1 worth of Luna for one TerraUSD, meaning if TerraUSD falls below $1 more Luna is created to make TerraUSD more scarce and bring the price back up to its $1 peg.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, the stablecoin lost its peg on Saturday and again on Monday jeopardizing the whole ecosystem. As such when people sell large amounts of TerraUSD, putting downward pressure on the price, more Luna will be printed and supply could increase exponentially. <\/span>","The Terra community is even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/146254\/terraform-labs-ceo-do-kwon-unveils-plan-to-restore-ust-peg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">planning to increase<\/a> this, allowing for the minting of more LUNA \u2014 even though this will put even greater downward pressure on its price.","© 2023 The Block.
