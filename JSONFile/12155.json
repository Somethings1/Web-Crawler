Process servers tossed papers at O\u2019Neal\u2019s moving car, he said in a court filing, but never succeeded in actually serving him. The basketball legend is asking a court to dismiss the lawsuit.","\"This purported \u2018service\u2019 is inadequate,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/ecf.flsd.uscourts.gov\/doc1\/051025963229?caseid=623680\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">O'Neal's lawyers said in a court filing<\/a>. \u201CIt should be quashed, and the claims against Mr. O\u2019Neal dismissed.\u201D","O\u2019Neal is one of more than a dozen celebrities and sports figures being sued for promoting FTX, the now-bankrupt crypto exchange. Targets of the lawsuit, which was filed by an Oklahoma man who says he is an FTX customer include promoters like Tom Brady and Steph Curry.","Although O\u2019Neal appears regularly on television, hosts a podcast and is a touring DJ, lawyers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/226496\/shaquille-oneal-crypto-ftx-lawsuit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">struggled to serve him<\/a> with official notice that he was the target of a lawsuit.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","According to Moskowitz, process servers \u201Cpersonally\u201D gave O\u2019Neal notice of the FTX class action lawsuit outside of his Atlanta home in April. But O\u2019Neal\u2019s lawyers, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, said in court documents that the papers never made it into his hands.&nbsp;","\u201CTwo process servers \u2014 neither of whom is registered in Georgia \u2014 saw Mr. O\u2019Neal driving his car out of his residence. They crowded the road outside the double residential gate to his property, making it so he had to drive by both of them to leave his home, and then stepped outside their cars,\u201D O\u2019Neal\u2019s lawyers said in court documents. \u201CMr. O\u2019Neal \u2014 who never exited his car \u2014 drove past the strangers lurking outside his home, one of the process servers \u2018tossed the legal documents at the front of\u2019 his car.\u201D","O'Neal's lawyers said in a court filing that he was never properly served.","Moskowitz, the class action lawyer, disputed O'Neal's account. He said the exchange was captured on video and went as far as to suggest O'Neal tried to \"possibly injure\" the process server in an email to The Block on Tuesday.","\"It is really disappointing and surreal. The video will show Mr. O\u2019Neal finally being served, after many months of hiding, as he attempts to possibly injure the process server. We expected better from an officer of the law,\" Moskowitz said, referencing O'Neal's role as an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orlandosentinel.com\/2019\/03\/18\/florida-sheriffs-office-adds-shaq-as-auxiliary-deputy\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">auxillary deputy sheriff<\/a>. \"Mr. O\u2019Neal and his lawyers need to stop running and finally deal with these serious allegations.\"","It\u2019s not clear whether O\u2019Neal has video footage of the incident, as Moskowitz claims, or if he plans to release it.","This latest wrinkle in the FTX class action suit comes after a dramatic, months long effort to serve O'Neal. At one point, a process server apparently gave up on trying to serve O'Neal after receiving a threatening text message. It is not clear who sent the message.","In O'Neal's view, process servers did not give him official notice of the lawsuit before an April deadline and the case against him should be dismissed.
