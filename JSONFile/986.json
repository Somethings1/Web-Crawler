The developers behind at least three dog-themed tokens \u2014 based around the Shiba Inu breed of dog \u2014 decided to send half of their tokens to his publicly known Ethereum <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">address<\/a>. These tokens included Shiba Inu (SHIB), Akita Inu (AKITA) and Dogelon Mars (ELON).","The theory behind this was that the approach was akin to burning the tokens. Presumably, the idea was that Buterin \u2014 who <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x220866b1a2219f40e72f5c628b65d54268ca3a9d\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">owns 333,500 ETH<\/a> worth around $1.3 billion \u2014 wouldn\u2019t need the cash and would just sit on the tokens. Shiba Inu\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shibatoken.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">website<\/a> stated that the tokens sent to him were \u201Cburned,\u201D and that everyone has to buy the tokens on the open market (as opposed to the team owning a large supply from the get-go).","Buterin appears to have had other ideas, however. Starting a few hours ago, Buterin began sending the tokens in batches to Uniswap and selling them for ETH. He sold 660 billion SHIB, 140 billion AKITA and 43 billion ELON \u2014 and also removed 13,291 wrapped ETH in liquidity from Uniswap \u2014 creating a total of 15,719 ETH, an amount worth about $63 million.&nbsp;","Such dog-themed meme tokens have taken off recently, following Dogecoin\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/101956\/dogecoin-very-price-surge-meme-crypto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rapid rise<\/a> over the last few months. A common theme is that they are built around similar memes but the tokens tend to have much larger supplies (in the quadrillions of units). With recent exchange listings, some of the tokens have seen their prices jump sharply, with one SHIB token holder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/104439\/shiba-inu-token-holder-turns-17-into-5-9-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">turning $17 into $5.9 million<\/a> in under a year.","Yet Buterin's market moves have significantly impacted the prices of the three tokens. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu is down 30%, Akita Inu is down 50% and Dogelon Mars is down 73% over the past twenty-four hours.","Following the sales, Buterin sent large amounts of ETH to various charities that support different causes. He gave out more than 16,000 ETH along with some of the dog-themed tokens.","The largest tranche \u2014 13,292 ETH \u2014 was sent to Givewell, a non-profit charity assessment organization.","The Ethereum creator also sent 1,000 ETH and 430 billion ELON tokens ($215,000) to the Methuselah Foundation, which focuses on making people live longer. He sent 1,050 ETH to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, which focuses on ensuring AI has a positive impact.","Buterin sent 500 ETH and 10% of his SHIB tokens \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0xb65bcbb85c1633b0ab4e4886c3cd8eeaeb63edbb39cacdb9223fdcf4454fd2c7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">some 50.6 trillion tokens<\/a> \u2014 to Crypto Covid, a relief fund for India.&nbsp;He also <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0x2fb8b58f85ab4773da00771f7f1e1a9eacf99af0ef3310b75ebcd017099f7b3c\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">gave<\/a> 49 trillion AKITA to Ethereum-focused grants program Gitcoin's <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/owocki\/status\/1392542552880865280?s=19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">community multisig<\/a>. While these tokens have a paper value of $1.1 billion and $443 million, respectively, they are fairly illiquid. For example, AKITA could only be sold for around $5 million on decentralized exchange Uniswap.","He also gave 500 ETH to Charter Cities, which looks to support charter cities around the world.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This report has been updated with additional information.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
