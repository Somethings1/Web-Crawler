But that number remains significant because the frequency of such activity is expected to rise in 2021, wrote Chainalysis chief scientist Jacob Illum in a draft shared with The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One factor in this numerical growth will be purely logistical \u2014 blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic haven\u2019t found all the crime-tied activity that occurred in 2020. As such, they're likely to uncover additional instances this year, as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.chainalysis.com\/reports\/2021-crypto-crime-report-intro-ransomware-scams-darknet-markets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis previously mentioned<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> was the case with the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/73412\/china-arrested-suspects-of-plustoken-ponzi-scheme\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">PlusToken Ponzi scheme<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The key events date back to 2019, but many of the key players weren\u2019t identified until the following year.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Illum mentions another reason for the increased DeFi activity rate:&nbsp;because cybercriminals have taken note of DeFi\u2019s smart contracts, which route funds into users wallets depending on the terms stipulated in the code. There's a lack of human oversight between transactions, and Illum argues that money laundering via DeFi will increase as a result.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe question that remains is whether the most popular platforms will be those where administrators retain enough control to prevent criminal transactions, as we saw in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/82899\/kucoin-thief-dex-money-laundering\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KuCoin hack<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">,\u201D Illum wrote.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The third is that dark markets, like Televend, are decentralizing. Televend uses encrypted automated chat bots on Telegram to connect more than 150,000 vendors to buyers. Buyers place orders on a vendor\u2019s automated chat and then receive a BTC address generated by the bot.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CTelevend receives commissions on each sale, but never actually touches the funds, so there\u2019s no central entity for law enforcement to track through blockchain analysis \u2014 the transactions blend in much more easily,\u201D Illum wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>"],"hashtag":["CRIME","DEXS"]}
