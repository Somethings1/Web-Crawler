Last December, NYDIG helped <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/87378\/massmutual-bitcoin-insurance-purchase\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MassMutual acquire $100 million worth of bitcoin<\/a> for its general investment account, and at the time, the insurance firm also acquired a $5 million stake in NYDIG.","New York Life appears to be the second insurance company backing NYDIG. It is not clear whether the company has also invested in bitcoin via NYDIG. A spokesperson of the company recently told The Block: \"New York Life does not comment on its General Account investments.\"","But NYDIG today said that life, annuity, and property &amp; casualty insurers now own, in aggregate, more than $1 billion of direct and indirect bitcoin exposure facilitated by NYDIG and held on its custody platform.","Earlier this year, NYDIG co-founder and CEO Robert Gutmann <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/91466\/ceo-insurance-fund-buy-bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told The Block<\/a> that he believes publicly-traded companies, including insurance firms, will invest in bitcoin. These companies have a \"fiduciary duty to consider whether holding 100% of your assets in dollars is in the best interest of your shareholders,\" according to Gutmann.","The growth capital round brings NYDIG's total funding to date to $305 million. The firm has previously raised a total of $105 million, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/nydig\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crunchbase<\/a>.","Gutmann today said the growth capital round's investors are partners for the firm. \"NYDIG will be working with these firms on Bitcoin-related strategic initiatives spanning investment management, insurance, banking, clean energy, and philanthropy,\" he said.","NYDIG appears to be on a growth streak. In January, the firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/90682\/digital-asset-data-nydig\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acquired Digital Assets Data<\/a> to expand its data capabilities. Last month, NYDIG <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/95021\/nydig-bitcoin-etf-sec-filing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application<\/a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.","Â© 2023 The Block.
