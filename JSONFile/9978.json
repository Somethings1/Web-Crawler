Gavin Newsom\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172676\/california-gov-newsom-nixes-crypto-license-bill\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">veto<\/a> of a state crypto licensing bill earlier this month frees up his administration to create its own regulations, said Dee Dee Myers, director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Business and Economic Development. The vetoed bill proposed that digital assets firm in the state apply for a license to operate.","\u201CThe bill created a regulatory regime in a very narrow lane,\u201D she said, adding, \u201CWe told the Assembly to try again and to work with [California] government agencies to get it right.\u201D&nbsp;","Instead, the Newsom administration is basing its own regulatory work on an executive order the governor <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.ca.gov\/2022\/05\/04\/governor-newsom-signs-blockchain-executive-order-to-spur-responsible-web3-innovation-grow-jobs-and-protect-consumers\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued<\/a> in May. The order aims to provide more clarity and flexibility for the crypto industry, while retaining the consumer protections in the vetoed Assembly bill, Myers argued.&nbsp;","The goal is to work in \u201Ctandem with the federal government,\u201D to ensure that there is no conflict between California\u2019s regulations and the federal government\u2019s, Myers said in an interview at Circle's Converge22 conference in San Francisco.","\u201CWe are hoping the federal government leads on regulations,\" adding, \u201CWe have to go fast, but we have to be careful,\u201D she said of the Newsom administration plans. \u201CWe need to measure twice and cut once.\u201D","The vetoed bill would have put onerous restrictions on the growing crypto industry, at the risk of stifling innovation, added Gayle Miller, chief deputy director of the state Department of Finance. \"We want the industry to continue to expand here, and we'll do what it takes to continue to build [the crypto and web3 industries].\" The state wants industry input to help create regulations, Myers said. \"Everybody thinks it's important to have a clear set of guidelines.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;","The Newsom administration believes any regulatory regime it creates will be a model for other states. \u201CWhen California puts forth cutting-edge regulations, a lot of other states follow suit and adopt them,\u201D Myers said, making the comparison between the current digital asset debate to California's regulations on automobiles in the 1960s, which influenced rules in other states and on the national level.&nbsp;","Myers added that the California officials are in dialogue with other states, even those led by Republican governors and state legislatures around digital asset regulation, though she did not go into specifics. \u201CThere is huge bipartisan interest in us getting this right,\u201D Myers said.","Regulating crypto\u2019s environmental impact is one way the state could deviate from the federal government. The Biden administration <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/168621\/white-house-report-proposes-possible-restrictions-on-proof-of-work-crypto-mining\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised concerns<\/a> over the energy consumption of proof-of-work mining in a report issued earlier this month, and Ethereum's recent switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in an event known as The Merge aimed to lessen the blockchain's energy use.","Myers said that California would take a close look at regulating crypto mining's environmental impact.&nbsp;","\u201CEnvironmental protection is more than California\u2019s goal; it\u2019s our mission,\u201D said Myers.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
