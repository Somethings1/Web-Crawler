Because of the way the two tokens were designed to interact, this led to a huge supply increase in LUNA and a resultant price crash.","Binance Labs was an <a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2018\/08\/29\/terra-raises-32-million-to-build-the-future-of-money-with-blockchain\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">early backer<\/a> of Terraform Labs, having co-led its $32 million seed round in 2018.
