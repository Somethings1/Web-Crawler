{"summary":"DeFi lending platform Compound has placed borrow caps on 10 non-stablecoin crypto collateral assets, including its own token COMP.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/190583\/defi-lender-compound-to-set-borrow-caps-on-10-crypto-collateral-assets","publishDate":"2022-11-29T08:43:19","id":6569,"type":null,"title":"DeFi lender Compound to set borrow caps on 10 crypto collateral assets","category":["DEFI"],"content":["Compound will enforce loan limits on 10 crypto tokens in its version 2 protocol at the end of November, thus reducing the amount of the affected collateral that users can borrow.","This decision is based on a governance <a href=\"https:\/\/compound.finance\/governance\/proposals\/135\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">vote<\/a> concluded on Monday. The governance vote was on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comp.xyz\/t\/risk-parameter-updates-2022-11-23\/3802\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposal<\/a> submitted by DeFi risk management protocol Gauntlet to the Compound DAO. Gauntlet\u2019s proposal called for Compound to set borrow caps on certain collateral assets. This move, Gauntlet explained, was to adjust the risk parameters of Compound v2.","The 10 crypto collateral assets affected include Compound\u2019s own COMP token as well as wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and Uniswap\u2019s UNI token. Other tokens include SushiSwap\u2019s SUSHI, Aave\u2019s AAVE, and MakerDAO\u2019s MKR. In total, 10 collateral assets will have borrow limits on Compound v2. Half of these tokens, including WBTC and SUSHI, did not previously have any borrow caps.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The new borrow cap for non-stablecoin collateral on Compound v2. Table: Compound governance<\/span>","For Gauntlet, the need to enforce loan limits has to do with limiting the impact of high-risk attack vectors. The DeFi risk manager pointed to DeFi lender Aave, which recently incurred <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189606\/llama-and-gauntlet-submit-proposal-to-cover-1-6-million-in-bad-debt-on-aave\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$1.6 million in bad debt<\/a>. Aave\u2019s bad debt originated from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/189167\/curve-token-jumps-50-amid-squeeze-on-big-short-position\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a big short position<\/a> on the CurveDAO token (CRV).","Gauntlet argued that borrow caps on non-stablecoin collateral assets had insignificant capital efficiency risks. This is because 96% of Compound\u2019s lending volume is in stablecoins. The DeFi risk manager added that these limits could be increased in the future if organic demand for the affected collateral assets begins to increase.","Not everyone in the Compound community agreed with Gauntlet\u2019s plan. Some community members argued that enacting borrow caps could reduce Compound\u2019s competitiveness in the DeFi market and force volume to migrate to competitors like Aave. Despite these objections, the vote passed with unanimous approval.","Compound setting borrow caps on these assets is the latest move by DeFi lenders to protect against market manipulation and other tail risks associated with tokens with unfavorable liquidity profiles. Compound previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179688\/compound-suspends-four-tokens-with-low-liquidity-as-lending-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suspended the use of four tokens<\/a> \u2014 0x, basic attention token, yearn, and MKR \u2014 as lending collateral. These tokens are among the list of ten tokens with borrow limits. Aave has also paused the use of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/190199\/aave-pauses-lending-markets-for-17-ethereum-based-tokens\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">17 Ethereum-based tokens<\/a> in its lending platform.","Â© 2023 The Block.
