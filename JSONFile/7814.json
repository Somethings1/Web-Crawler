Thousands of people have already joined the channel today. The Block reached out to Binance to confirm whether the KYC documents are a result of an internal leak or whether the documents originate from phishing attacks or a KYC account selling service.","Leah Li, global PR manager at Binance, told The Block:","\"There are inconsistencies when comparing this data to the data in our system. At the present time, no evidence has been supplied that indicates any KYC images have been obtained from Binance, as these images do not contain the digital watermark imprinted by our system.\u201D","\u201CWith that said, our security team is hard at work pursuing all possible leads in an attempt to identify the source of these images, as it remains unclear where they were obtained,\u201D she added.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao (\u201CCZ\u201D) also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cz_binance\/status\/1158978929803182080?s=21\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> earlier today: \u201CDon't fall into the \"KYC leak\" FUD.

Earlier this year, a darknet vendor was reportedly selling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/01\/21\/a-darknet-vendor-is-allegedly-selling-images-and-data-associated-with-crypto-exchange-identity-verification-processes\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">100,000 personal documents<\/a> that were used to pass KYC on several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance.","Binance responded similarly to The Block at the time, saying that it investigated the photos in question, but there was no evidence that the leak was from Binance.","The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, for its part, has been taking several initiatives to up its compliance game.
