This partnership gave Bitcoin IRA access to Kingdom Trust\u2019s client and account information, states the suit. The document also claims that Bitcoin IRA shared these trade secrets with BitGo.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In June 2019, the Kingdom Trust client portal hosted by Bitcoin IRA started to display a link inviting clients to upgrade their accounts.

The suit accused Kingdom Trust of thwarting customers' requests to transfer their cryptocurrencies to competing custodians.&nbsp;","Regarding the referral program between Bitcoin IRA and Kingdom Trust, Bitcoin IRA claims that the custodian abused the program and employed \"unfair\" and \"deceptive\" tactics when some customers asked to move their accounts to another custodian, per Digital IRA's complaint.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The story has been updated with a comment from BitGo and the complaint from Digital IRA.&nbsp;<\/em>"],"hashtag":[]}
