He observed that there\u2019s been explosive growth in the ETFs in general, which has met the pent-up demand. He mentioned that we are now in a phase between that stage and the next one, which will entail more growth and institutionalization of these products.","Ashraf stated that there were three key drivers of demand for the bitcoin ETFs.","He mentioned the first one as the macroeconomic environment and changing demographics in terms of wealth \u2014 something he said should not be underestimated in terms of its impact. He remarked that this demographic might alter the standard crypto cycle as, for instance, investors buying bitcoin through a registered investment advisor are unlikely to market sell when the price drops 10%.","The second area is the maturation of the industry, something he described as really important. He cited the influx of more venture capitalists into the space and traditional advisors as supporting this trend. Moreover, he noted that simple things like custody for cryptocurrencies have become more secure.","Ashraf pointed to the improving regulatory environment as the third area driving demand. He remarked that more clarity and certainty are starting to emerge. However, he added, this is still in the early stages.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
