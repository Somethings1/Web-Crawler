It also emphasized that the exchange token was an \"investment\" in its language. \"The FTT materials made clear that FTX\u2019s core management team\u2019s efforts would drive the growth and ultimate success of FTX,\" the complaint states.","The SEC's stance throws a shadow over similar tokens issued by rival crypto exchanges. The regulator takes particular issue with FTX's buyback-and-burn practice \u2014 something other centralized exchanges, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/blog\/ecosystem\/21st-bnb-burn-5796199988714890033\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance<\/a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.okx.com\/support\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/9209401768589-OKB-Buy-Back-Burn-report-2022-06-01-2022-8-31-\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OKX<\/a>, do with their exchange tokens, akin to stock buybacks in traditional markets.","Even so, the prices for exchange tokens haven't reacted negatively to the news. The largest, Binance's BNB, has been trading flat over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. OKX's OKB, on the other hand, is up nearly 2%. Crypto.com's cronos is up less than 1%, and Huobi's HT is up 1.5%.
