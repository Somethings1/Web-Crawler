It first announced its $25 million Series B fundraise in November 2021.","The fundraise marks a strategic pivot away from what CEO and co-founder Sam Huber called the \"red sea\" of advertising, which it had originally built its business on.","The company will use the capital to continue building out its protocol <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194568\/landvaults-new-protocol-mints-metaverse-builds-and-experiences-as-nfts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Matera<\/a>, which puts metaverse builds \u2014 such as virtual shops or stadiums \u2014 on-chain. It will also be used to grow commercial operations across its hubs in Dubai, Europe, the U.S. and Asia and will further invest in technology, notably AI-powered tools to accelerate the creation and monetization of metaverse content.&nbsp;","\u201COur vision has always been to accelerate the economy of the metaverse and the latest progress in AI technology is helping us fast track our roadmap,\" Huber said in an interview. \"The metaverse needs a \u2018Wordpress moment\u2019 for anyone to build in the metaverse as easily as building a website, and we are investing heavily in R&amp;D to build these tools.\u201D","As for whether Huber is worried that metaverse hype is fading, with the news that mega corps such as Meta and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/223175\/disney-has-nixed-its-metaverse-team-wsj?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disney<\/a> are scaling back their visions: \u201CWe are past the peak of inflated expectations,\" he said. \"Every time I have a doubt I just look at the Generation Alpha, who were basically born playing games instead of being on social media. They use games as a way to communicate. They are citizens of the metaverse. That\u2019s who we\u2019re building for.\"","The company decided to start raising in January following the Christmas break, Huber told The Block. The fresh funds, raised through funders and companies the organization already knew, have so far topped the Series B round up to $28 million. Huber noted that LandVault is one of the biggest builders currently working in The Sandbox.","There is also a potential further $2 million closing in the next few weeks, which would bring the funding total to $30 million. With the top up, LandVault's valuation remains the same \u2013 somewhere in the \"low nine-figures,\" Huber said.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
