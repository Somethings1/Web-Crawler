But the impact of Blur taking over the marketplace arena by doling out generous incentives and introducing a radically reduced royalty structure has made it even harder for other companies in the space.&nbsp;","That's especially when it comes to top NFT studio Yuga Labs that was once valued at $4 billion. The creator of celebrated collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club announced last week that it's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255243\/yuga-labs-cuts-employees-focuses-on-metaverse-extension-amid-restructuring\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">laying off staff<\/a> \u2014 and it may well be a consequence of drying up revenues.","As traders flocked to Blur amid NFT prices sinking across the board, Yuga Labs' already declining royalty revenue fell off a cliff. It dropped to $2.5 million for the third quarter ending in September versus $8.7 million during the first quarter of this year.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A look at the amount of royalties paid to Yuga Labs each day since January 2023. Image: The Block Research.<\/span>","\"Blur's calculated entry into the NFT space with a minimum 0.5% royalty fee, coupled with attractive airdrops and bidding incentives, struck a compelling economic chord with traders,\" said Brad Kay, analyst at The Block Research. \"By slashing transaction costs, it boosted trader profits and siphoned off significant user activity from higher-fee platforms like OpenSea, where Yuga Labs had previously thrived.\"","\"This shift led not only to a sharp contraction in Yuga Labs' royalty income, but also to a fundamental reconfiguration of the NFT marketplace,\" Kay added.","For years, OpenSea handled the large majority of NFT trading, distributing a 2.5% royalty fee on every sale to the creator of the collection. Top-shelf collections could earn millions of dollars each month.","Then Blur both offered traders generous bonuses to use its platform instead of others \u2014 handing out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/211374\/blur-debuts-long-awaited-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tokens<\/a> based on activity \u2014 and introduced a somewhat <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238026\/blur-founder-defends-platform-amid-nft-market-slump\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">irresistible royalty<\/a> fee of 0.5%.
