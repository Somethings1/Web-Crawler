We\u2019ll see how serious this is. It could be really serious. It could just be a small fine like it usually is,\u201D Cermak said. \u201CThe only question will be, \u2018What's the actual impact?\u2019\"","Cermak questioned how easy it might be for Binance to continue existing amid the enforcement action. He pointed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/187824\/u-s-prosecutors-recommend-12-month-probation-for-former-bitmex-executive\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmex<\/a>. The platform no longer operates in the U.S. after its founders pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, and took years to remove customers in the country.","\u201CAt the same time, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-sdny\/pr\/founders-cryptocurrency-exchange-plead-guilty-bank-secrecy-act-violations\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitmex<\/a>&nbsp;is still around. It's still trading. So it's like it didn't lead to closure of the exchange, but obviously it wasn't good for it,\u201D Gaevoy said.","\u201CThey kind of faded away as soon as that came out and now they're like the most irrelevant in terms of liquidity,\u201D Cermak replied. \u201CBut also I think the timing was really good for Binance and FTX to start taking some of that market share.\u201D","Gaevoy also said that there are still U.S. banks willing to work with crypto companies, taking the place of recently collapsed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/218223\/silvergate-will-liquidate-bank-wind-down-operations\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Silvergate<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/219119\/state-regulator-takes-control-of-signature-bank-federal-regulators-guarantee-deposits\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Signature<\/a>.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For more of Frank\u2019s chat with Evgeny and Larry, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/223582\/q12023-market-update\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Scoop podcast<\/a>.<\/em><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n","© 2023 The Block.
