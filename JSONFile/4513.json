The level of compliance to receive a license is much higher than the requirements for registration. To obtain a license a firm must also be domiciled in France. \"Firms must comply with certain requirements in terms of organization, financial resources and business conduct,\" the AMF said.","The EU passed its Markets in Crypto Assets regulatory framework, MiCA, in April. Under the new legislation, digital asset providers will be required to have obtained a full license from a member state to operate within the EU by January 2025.","© 2023 The Block.
