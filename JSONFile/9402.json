Before assuming an official role at the company, Kline had participated in its fundraising efforts.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI led the fundraising round and I was invited to be co-founder of Edge &amp; Node along with the initial founders of The Graph,\u201D Kline said, adding that she has helped raise a total of $77.5 million.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Up until now, Edge &amp; Node\u2019s primary focus has been making sure the technology buttressing the The Graph protocol is ready for \"mass migration,\" said Kline.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe\u2019ve had an engineer at the helm from the very beginning and that was very important [initially],\u201D she said, adding that the focus has shifted to migrating as many web3 applications as possible to The Graph infrastructure. \u201CRight now what we need is someone with that business mind \u2026 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m good at doing.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Edge &amp; Node has labelled The Graph a \u201Cweb3 protocol for organizing and accessing blockchain data.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe Graph is the only decentralized indexing and query protocol,\u201D Kline explained. \u201CWhat that means is The Graph is organizing data that\u2019s on the blockchain.
