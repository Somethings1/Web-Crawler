We are significantly investing in our new crypto, blockchain, and digital currencies business unit in order to help shape this more inclusive future.\"","A source with knowledge of the plans described the business unit plan as PayPal \"going all in\" on such services.","Schulman also said that PayPal is \"excited to build upon this early success by allowing customers to use their crypto balance as a funding source whenever they shop at our 29 million merchants.\"","\"We anticipate the rollout of that capability to begin late this quarter, and we hope to launch our first international market in the next several months,\" he went on to explain. A Venmo integration with crypto is expected \"in the coming months.\"","Schulman described such steps as \"just the beginning of an extensive roadmap around crypto, blockchain, and digital currencies.\"","Among other factoids: per Schulman, \"everyone who signed up for crypto is opening up their app two times as much as they previously did.\"","PayPal made its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/81794\/paypal-to-enable-crypto-purchases-with-the-help-of-paxos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto services<\/a> official last October with the launch of a partnership with industry startup Paxos, as reported at the time.
