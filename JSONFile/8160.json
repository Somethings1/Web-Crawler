The event will see the reward for miners on the network drop from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block, meaning some mining operations may no longer be viable.","Previous Bitcoin network hashrate declines post-halving have been in the 15-20% range. However, the analysts estimate miner shutdowns to be lower this time around, with a hashrate reduction estimate of around 7% \u2014 revised from 15%, and the bull market aiding balance sheets.","Chhugani and Sapra expect this to benefit more efficient, lower-cost miners such as CleanSpark and Riot Platforms the most, enabling them to gain relative market share post-halving.","The analysts anticipate Riot and CleanSpark to emerge as category leaders in the space as the largest miners with the most self-mining capacity. However, they also highlighted Marathon Digital's potential, given its transition to a self-mining model and high liquidity position.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin network hashrate and miner liquidity positions.
