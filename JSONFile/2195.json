","Appearing at ETHSeoul on Friday evening, Buterin answered questions from journalists during a Q&amp;A session, during which he addressed the potential impact of this kind of a hard fork on the Ethereum network.&nbsp;","In response to a question about this plan, Buterin said he doesn\u2019t see an organic aspect to it and claimed it\u2019s just a \u201Ccouple of outsiders that basically have exchanges, and mostly just want to make a quick buck.\u201D","\"I'm not expecting it to have substantial, long-term adoption,\" Buterin said.","Buterin acknowledged that there may be \u201Ca couple of splats on some markets in the meantime,\u201D before adding \u201CI hope that whatever happens, doesn't lead to people losing money.\u201D This may refer to exchanges launching IOU products, enabling traders to take punts on what the value of the forked tokens will be, assuming they go ahead. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162019\/three-crypto-exchanges-are-letting-traders-bet-on-tokens-for-anticipated-ethereum-fork\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Three exchanges<\/a> are now offering such products.","The Ethereum co-founder \u2013 who stepped back from core Ethereum development a few years ago \u2013 also spoke about Ethereum Classic, adding that it has a \u201Csuperior community and a superior product\u201D for people who support proof-of-work values and preferences."],"hashtag":["ETHEREUM"]}
