Such lending vaults combine isolated markets and multi-asset lending pools to provide users with a way to earn yield on their assets.","\u201CWorking with a team of quants used to trading in milliseconds, we\u2019ve always looked for faster paths to proactively manage risk and capture growth opportunities. MetaMorpho is our best opportunity yet to directly stress test our capabilities,\u201D said Nick Cannon, VP Growth at Gauntlet.&nbsp;","This comes as Gauntlet had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278526\/gauntlet-announces-exit-from-aave-as-risk-manager\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recently exited<\/a> its collaboration with Morpho's competitor AaveDAO citing \"inconsistent guidelines.\"&nbsp;","Notably, Gauntlet is not appointed by the Morpho DAO, unlike how Gauntlet worked with Aave. Unlike the approach DAOs select only one or two risk managers, Morpho takes a permissionless mechanism with MetaMorpho vaults.","Vaults designed by risk curators like Gauntlet earn their fees on their own risk management, and Morpho takes no cut, a spokesperson told The Block. Morpho has over $900 million in total value locked, nearly one-tenth of the $9.2 billion locked on Aave across different chains.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
