The NFT demo is one example of the web3 utility Flare can unlock for legacy tokens, enabling them to be used trustlessly in dapps on the network. We are excited to see what other applications engineers can develop, harnessing the capabilities of Flare\u2019s native interoperability protocols.\u201D<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Watch demo video <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g0qxxm2EZjw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">here.<\/a><\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Summary diagram of the NFT trigger process<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","","","Â© 2023 The Block.
