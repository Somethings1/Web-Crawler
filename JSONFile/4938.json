And I think it's pretty clear evidence that something needs to get done,\u201D he added, citing fraud and manipulation concerns.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lawmakers have drafted and passed some bills to regulate crypto, including one that is teed up for a vote in the full House that would give the CFTC more power. The bill, titled the \u201CFit for the 21st Century Act,\u201D is being led by House Republicans who say the bill will close the gaps between the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/223887\/sec-chair-gensler-existing-rules-regulate-crypto-legislation-unnecessary\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">legislation<\/span><\/a> is not necessary and that existing securities laws regulate crypto, while noting that most cryptocurrencies are securities. Meanwhile, Behnam said on Monday that 70 percent of the market are commodities.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe fix is hopefully getting legislation out of Congress that would fill the gap around commodity tokens,\u201D Behnam said in the podcast with ICE Chief Communications Officer Josh King<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Both agencies need to work together to regulate crypto, Behnam said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI'm encouraged by the questions from members of Congress, by the hearings, by the markups. One or two of them happened last week, and the momentum that's happening, and I think clear recognition that if we don't do something collectively, we're going to continue to have these crises,\u201D Behnam said. \u201CWe're going to continue to have customer losses.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">King and Behnam also spoke about bitcoin products on Monday. King said some bitcoin futures contracts had been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ice.com\/publicdocs\/futures_us\/exchange_notices\/ICE_Futures_US_ExNotBTCDelist20230728.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">delisted<\/a> recently.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CInterestingly, we've just delisted the futures contracts for Bitcoin from Bakkt this week. We thought there'd be a market, there wasn't,\u201D King said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The comments came as crypto exchange Coinbase obtained <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/245626\/coinbase-obtains-regulatory-approval-to-offer-crypto-futures-trading-to-eligible-clients\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">regulatory<\/span><\/a> approval this week to offer crypto futures trading services to eligible customers in the U.S.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
