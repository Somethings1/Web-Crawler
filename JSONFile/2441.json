This case is one a few that have been publicly filed, and the allegations are alarming -- including a claim that AT&amp;T insiders were deeply involved in what sounds like a devastating SIM swapping scheme.&nbsp;","The plaintiff is Seth Shapiro, a resident of California. The Complaint says that Mr. Shapiro is a \u201Ca two-time Emmy Award-winning media and technology expert, author, and adjunct professor at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts.\u201D He also was, at the relevant times for the lawsuit, a subscriber of AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T \u201Cis the second largest wireless carrier in the United States, with more than 153 million subscribers, earning $71 billion in total operating revenues in 2017 and $71 billion in 2018.\u201D","The gist of the case is that Shapiro alleges AT&amp;T failed to protect his account from a SIM swap that resulted in a major loss of cryptocurrency. What specifically happened? &nbsp;According to the complaint:","As if the preceding allegations weren\u2019t bad enough, the end result was:","Even worse, the scheme allegedly involved AT&amp;T employees working on the inside with outside hackers. And, unsurprisingly, there are chat logs:","Apparently, Mr. Shapiro was in fact SIM-swapped multiple times, and all of his personal information was taken along with access to other accounts such as Google, and Evernote. Furthermore, Mr. Shapiro\u2019s family was impacted, and he was threatened. It sounds awful. Despite this, after each incident, AT&amp;T allegedly said they followed proper procedures and alerted necessary authorities, but as the complaint states, \u201CMr. Shapiro\u2019s trust in AT&amp;T was misplaced.\u201D","So, What is Shapiro actually suing for; in other words, what is the cause of action?","One header in the lawsuit summarizes the nature of the action: \u201C<em class=\"mq\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AT&amp;T\u2019s Repeated Failures to Protect Mr. Shapiro\u2019s Account from Unauthorized Access Are a Violation of Federal Law<\/em>.\u201D The argument alleges that AT&amp;T is fully aware that the information they hold in trust for their subscribers is highly sensitive and extremely valuable. Mr. Shapiro is arguing that AT&amp;T knows this to be the case, yet the company has failed in a variety of ways to take the necessary steps to protect their subscriber\u2019s information.&nbsp;","Specifically, Shapiro has alleged violations of federal and state laws, in addition to common law torts. This includes (1) an alleged violation of the Federal Communications act for allegedly failing to protect confidentiality of his account information, (2) an alleged violation of the California state unfair business practices statute, (3) an alleged violation of the California state constitution's right to privacy, (4) two negligence claims, (5) an alleged violation of California Consumer's Legal Remedies Act and (6) a violation of the Federal Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act. &nbsp;He seeks actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief.&nbsp;","These statutory claims are creative. They may be a tactic to try to get around AT&amp;T's arbitration agreement in its terms of service. The allegations in the complaint, if true, are really awful and seem calculated to give a court good reason to let these claims be litigated openly.","At the same time, it is somewhat inexplicable that the plaintiff maintained his service with AT&amp;T after multiple hacks, as so many other alleged victims also fail to do. Additionally, he apparently didn't switch from using his phone for two-factor authentication to apps or change to a new phone number. Those facts may or may not be relevant. We don't know.&nbsp;","Anyway, this is obviously a suit between two highly motivated parties. Mr. Shapiro has apparently been through the wringer. AT&amp;T definitely doesn\u2019t want to lose this high profile case given the recent prevalence of the SIM swap + cryptocurrency theft problem. The company will likely face nasty PR and further questions about its employee oversight and practices if the allegations in the lawsuit prove to be true.","And it would be extremely problematic for AT&amp;T if a court said its customers had a constitutional right of privacy that a telco could violate by allowing unauthorized account transfer. &nbsp;","This is an extremely interesting complaint, it is well crafted, and it is one that we will be watching closely.","<a title=\"View Shapiro SIM Swap Case on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/431041530\/Shapiro-SIM-Swap-Case#from_embed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Shapiro SIM Swap Case<\/a> by <a title=\"View Anonymous XdelME's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/user\/481118616\/Anonymous-XdelME#from_embed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Anonymous XdelME<\/a> on Scribd","<iframe id=\"doc_32648\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Shapiro SIM Swap Case\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/431041530\/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-LRkO6xuK8uxezhu9XFRR&amp;show_recommendations=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7729220222793488\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>"],"hashtag":[]}
