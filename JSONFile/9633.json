Unlike other collections that display images or the so-called profile picture-style NFTs, Loot featured randomly generated texts. The idea was that the text would be used in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/116746\/cryptos-latest-trend-is-to-play-games-before-theyre-even-built\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">yet-to-be-created games<\/a> (so rare words might one day become rare items). The collection was free to mint.","Upon its launch, Loot quickly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/116746\/cryptos-latest-trend-is-to-play-games-before-theyre-even-built\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">garnered popularity<\/a> in the NFT space with over $230 million in sales in the first week. Communities quickly formed around the collection leading to the creation of derivative projects (mostly other text-based NFT collections).","The crypto investment fund <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KyleSamani\/status\/1434408502714376197\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bought<\/a> 8 figures of Loot \u2014 at least $10 million \u2014 at the height of the collection\u2019s popularity in September 2021. At the time, Samani stated it was Multicoin\u2019s first NFT purchase. He said Loot\u2019s investment thesis was simple; it was \u201Cthe first investable crypto-native game.\u201D","This popularity did not, however, last long as trading activity on the collection soon plummeted. Data from NFT marketplace <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/lootproject?tab=activity\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OpenSea<\/a> shows that Loot\u2019s floor price on September 5 last year was about 9 ETH ($35,000 at the time). The floor price of Loot is now 1.1 ETH which amounts to $3,100 at current prices.","Today, Loot ranks outside the top 50 NFTs on OpenSea with a floor market capitalization of 8,557 ETH ($24 million) \u2014 that's calculated if you multiple the price of the cheapest Loot NFT by the number of NFTs in the collection.","Samani says Multicoin is still holding its Loot NFTs despite the 95% decline in the value of its investment in the NFT collection.","In March, Samani <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/136325\/heres-the-next-big-thing-in-nfts-according-to-multicoin-capitals-kyle-samani\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told The Block<\/a> that buying NFTs directly is not viable enough for Multicoin Capital to invest in at scale. He said it was unlikely that the firm would have even a 1% position in NFTs. Instead, he said the company will focus on the infrastructure layers supporting NFTs.","Â© 2023 The Block.
