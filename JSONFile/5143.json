Bittrex agreed on a settlement with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission last Thursday.","On Wednesday, Bittrex Global CEO Oliver Linch assured those \"who are increasingly wary of having any connection to the United States, given its regulatory uncertainty, that if they want to do business with a non-U.S. regulated digital assets exchange, Bittrex Global is here for you.\"&nbsp;","According to Bittrex Global's press release, the company will not have to pay to settle the enforcement action. \"What makes this result so unusual and gratifying is that our client, Bittrex Global, will put this matter behind it without paying a penny in settlement,\" Bittrex Global's legal counsel Andrew Michaelson said.","\u201CWhile this is good news for Bittrex Global, now is not the time for a victory lap. Instead, with this matter behind us, we can concentrate on building our vision for the future of crypto, as a regulated, mature, and sophisticated part of the wider financial ecosystem,\" Linch added.","The U.S. arm of the crypto exchange agreed to settle with the regulator for $24 million.

Court filings showed that Bittrex has more than 100,000 creditors and assets and liabilities estimated to be worth between $500 million and $1 billion.","In April, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2023-78\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SEC<\/a> brought charges against the U.S.-arm of the exchange and its co-founder William Shihara. The SEC said it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency in the U.S. At that time, the U.S. regulator also charged Bittrex Global for failing to register as \"a national securities exchange.\"","The SEC claimed Bittrex and Shihara directed token listing applicants to remove social media posts discussing price predictions, profit expectations, and other investment-related topics. \u201CFor years, Bittrex worked with token issuers to 'scrub' their online statements of any indication they were investment contracts \u2014 all in an effort to evade the federal securities laws. They failed,\u201D Gurbir S.
