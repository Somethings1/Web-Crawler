You can offer your doodle NFT and 60 ETH,\" said Steven Zheng, director of research at The Block.","Other tools, like SudoSwap, which lets a user barter for NFTs, offer this type of functionality today. But this feature is now becoming native to OpenSea.&nbsp;","Seaport will now also let people bid on specific traits from a collection. This is for cases whereby the bidder doesn't care what kind of NFT they get, as long as it features a trait they're looking for. For example, users who collect smiling NFTs can bid on any smiling Bored Ape from the collection.&nbsp;","The marketplace will also now allow tipping.&nbsp;","\"A fulfiller may include additional consideration items when fulfilling a listing as long as they do not \u201Ctip\u201D more than the original offer,\" said the statement from OpenSea. \"This allows alternative interfaces to include their own fees.\"","OpenSea doesn't control the protocol, positioning it as a shared and open resource for developers.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/nft-marketplace-monthly-volume\/embed\" title=\"NFT Marketplace Monthly Volume\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
