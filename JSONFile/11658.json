Whether it\u2019s affordably sending money across borders or self-custodying wealth, demand for Bitcoin has largely been driven by the need for a financial service. Similarly, with Ether, demand has been a function of using the asset in investment contracts, financial derivatives, and lending agreements. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As is expected of useful money, cryptocurrencies have quickly begun to develop credit markets in which long term holders can lend out their assets to those that have a greater immediate need for them. In exchange for lending out their capital, holders are compensated for the time value of their money via an <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interest rate<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. Interest rates are essential to any valuable forms of money because they help create non zero-sum wealth as both borrowers and long term investors can reap the reward of more efficient capital allocation.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the community continues its search for blockchain\u2019s \u2018killer app,\u2019 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/01\/18\/block-by-block-crypto-lending\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">secured lending<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> has quickly emerged to be one of the largest and fastest growing crypto use cases. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/genesiscap.co\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Genesis Capital<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> originated <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/genesiscap.co\/q4-insights\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">over $1 billion USD<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in crypto-secured loans in 2018, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/makerdao.com\/en\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MakerDAO<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, a decentralized credit facility, originated <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.placeholder.vc\/blog\/2019\/1\/23\/maker-investment-thesis\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">roughly $200 million USD<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in Ether-collateralized loans since they launched earlier last year.&nbsp;[related id=\"1\"]<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto-secured lending requires a borrower to post one crypto-asset as collateral in order to borrow another asset, often times fiat currency or a stablecoin. Borrowers always have to supply more collateral than the value of their loan to protect lenders from the risk of losing their money. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">From a borrower\u2019s stand point, the primary use cases for secured-lending are:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On the other side, lenders earn passive interest on their long-term holdings for providing this capital. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lending volumes to date have largely been driven by speculative trading activity and the need for short term cash. As Genesis pointed out in their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/genesiscap.co\/q4-insights\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Q4 2018 report<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, their main customers were crypto hedge funds looking to short assets like Bitcoin and Ether, proprietary trading desks that were arbitraging price discrepancies in the Bitcoin spot and futures markets, and companies that wanted short-term capital. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While most crypto-secured lending to date has been done in a centralized manner \u2014 meaning through an OTC desk or brokerage \u2014 there is an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.dharma.io\/dharma-markets-report-1-on-the-trade-offs-of-stablecoins-f1c61713609c\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">evolving class of lending platforms<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> being built on Ethereum that enable users to borrow and lend in a decentralized manner. Through the use of smart contracts, financial services can be created in which end-users don\u2019t need to place trust in a single operator to provide them access. By removing financial middlemen, these trustless applications stand to be much more efficient than their centralized counterparts.<\/span>","&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Generally speaking, crypto-secured loans can be originated through two distinct avenues: custodial and non-custodial. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Custodial lending involves borrowing and lending assets directly from a trusted third party. This third party has complete custody of their clients\u2019 funds at all times and acts as the counterparty within every transaction. Operators of custodial platforms also have more say in how interest rates are set as they essentially control the order book that borrowers and lenders transact through. In terms of popular asset types, most of the lending activity on custodial platforms is denominated in Bitcoin and various fiat currencies.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The most popular custodial lending avenues include centralized exchanges like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitfinex.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitfinex<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, OTC trading desks like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/genesiscap.co\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Genesis Capital<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, and credit facilities like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blockfi.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlockFi<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On the other hand, non-custodial lending involves borrowing and lending assets directly through smart contracts. In this case, smart contracts retain custody of the collateral throughout the entire loan life cycle, making counterparty malfeasance close to impossible. Often times, collateral is escrowed in a smart contract until either the borrower repays the loan or the loan goes into a state of default. If the borrower defaults, smart contracts can sell the underlying collateral through a DEX or a network of third parties in exchange for the principal plus interest. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this way, aside from the technical risk associated with smart contracts not working as planned, lenders using non-custodial avenues are exposed to far less counterparty risk than they would be by going through a centralized avenue. Since a majority of non-custodial platforms leverage Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts, most of the lending activity is denominated in Ether.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The most popular non-custodial lending avenues include <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/makerdao.com\/en\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MakerDAO<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/2G1ff9p\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dharma Lever<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/compound.finance\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Compound<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dydx.exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dYdX<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The following table compares the most popular custodial and non-custodial lending avenues across a number of key characteristics. <\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As we can see, for borrowers and lenders looking to transact in very high volumes, custodial avenues are probably best, although new solutions like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/2G1ff9p\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dharma Lever<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> are coming to market to address this need.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">And while there is clear demand for custodial lending within the crypto capital markets, these platforms fall victim to the same inefficiencies that plague centralized financial services. Namely, hacks related to centralized custody, lack of transparency about interest rate pricing, long settlement times, and high interest rates. And notably, these are all areas in which non-custodial solutions excel. The reason for this is clear: &nbsp;if a middleman is required to facilitate a transaction, they\u2019re able to take a cut off of each step. Similarly, there\u2019s no incentive for custodial lenders to offer transparency into their operation as the less their counterparty knows, the more value the custodial lender can extract. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While investors are increasingly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mikemcdonald.github.io\/eth-defi\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">locking up Ether in smart contracts<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to access trustless financial services, it\u2019s going to take time for institutional capital to fully embrace open finance. For one, these platforms will need to be battle tested before institutions feel comfortable storing a large amount of capital in smart contracts. Soon, insurance products will come to market to service this need and help bridge the comfort gap. Second, the lack of KYC within non-custodial platforms is a non-starter for institutions as they\u2019re much more strict with compliance. Solutions like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitski.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitski<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> are now being built to help users authenticate their identity across any decentralized application. Lastly, liquidity is still a large barrier given the fact that these financial platforms are so nascent. As non-custodial services continue to undercut centralized services across price and settlement time, these liquidity pools will start to exponentially grow.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s still very early days in trustless lending \u2014 a lot of liquidity needs to be formed and a great deal of infrastructure built. Notwithstanding the technical challenges faced by open financial applications more broadly, non-custodial lending solves a lot of user pain points today. Investors can take out loans against a number of different assets in sheer minutes, counterparty risk can be eliminated by smart contracts, borrowers can freely move their principal anywhere they\u2019d like, and most importantly, all of this can be done at almost half of the cost offered by traditional lenders.<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This piece was submitted through our contributor network by Max Bronstein, Marketing Manager at&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/dharma.io\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dharma Labs<\/a>.<\/em>&nbsp;<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dharma Labs<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is a Green Visor, Y Combinator, and Polychain Capital backed venture focused on building infrastructure and end-user products for an efficient, borderless, and transparent credit market.
