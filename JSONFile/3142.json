This integration is part of Cosmos Hub proposal 799, which garnered approval from the Cosmos Hub governance community with 97% of votes in favor.","Stride will be the second blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem to adopt Interchain Security after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230581\/cosmos-blockchain-neutron-goes-live-on-mainnet-with-replicated-security\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Neutron<\/a>.&nbsp;","Beginning today, as Stride incorporates ICS, block production responsibilities will transition from Stride\u2019s validator set to that of the Cosmos Hub \u2014 the central chain of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185784\/making-the-cosmos-hub-more-relevant-with-cosmos-co-founder-ethan-buchman\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cosmos<\/a>.

For Stride users, this means they can continue to stake STRD, earn staking rewards and participate actively in on-chain governance.","Stride\u2019s fundamental features, such as liquid staking, inter-blockchain communication protocol, will remain unchanged.","Â© 2023 The Block.
