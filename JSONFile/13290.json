EU regulation for crypto, he explained, must avoid regulatory divergence. The development of a common, high-level framework for digital assets must address the broad spectrum of attitudes that exist within the member states, with their own regulatory authorities. These range from the more conservative, prudentially led nations to the liberal, pro-innovation members. \u201CWe wanted to preserve a pan-European EU-wide market for crypto assets,\u201D he asserts.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">From aversion to understanding \u2013 the EU regulators\u2019 crypto journey<\/strong>","The EU has seen a trend, elaborates Kerstens, from an aversion to crypto assets to more of an interest in them. However, there must be a balance between anticipation of their huge potential and a better understanding of the risks that exist in these new markets. Digital assets must be embraced, though, in order that investors aren\u2019t forced to go offshore. By compelling trading to remain onshore, we foster participation in regulatory influence and development.","For crypto assets, this regulatory journey started with \u201Ca very strong request by market participants for legal clarity.\u201D One corner of a triangle, Kersten explains, this first, legal foundation must be balanced against two other important factors. The enablement of responsible innovation is one \u2013 allowing law-abiding participants to bring new products and services to market - offset against the other, the avoidance of obvious market failures, at an issuance level and within fraudulent schemes.","Eventus, a leading trade surveillance and market risk firm, is at the forefront of meeting that third challenge. By understanding and addressing the complexities of consuming hundreds of different data feeds and interpreting the regulations around market surveillance with the flexibility to adapt by region, market model and regulatory change, the company\u2019s Validus platform is ready for the influx of unique requirements as this new landscape emerges.","Kersten explains that because it\u2019s early, regulation will not solve all issues up-front. Flexibility is key here, and the question \u201Ctoo early, too late, when to regulate?\u201D is resolved by letting development go ahead and allowing market demand to define the pace. Maintaining a balance seems more important than speed as he explains it - avoiding one corner of the triangle while stressing the others.","Reassuringly though, the clear message from Kerstens is that the Commission is engaged, capable and broad-minded. Digital asset markets have exciting potential, but the road ahead has many challenges. The pace is fast-moving, and the nascent nature of this new market\u2019s underlying infrastructure \u2013 its lack of standards and the transient nature of its liquidity \u2013 means the journey will be far from straightforward. So those serving this market had better be prepared for some twists and turns along the way.","To watch a replay of all the sessions from the conference, click <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventussystems.com\/rewind\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HERE<\/a>.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/joe-schifano\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/em><\/strong><\/a>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/joe-schifano\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Joseph Schifano<\/em><\/a><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">is Global Head of Regulatory Affairs at <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/eventussystems.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Eventus<\/em><\/a><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.
