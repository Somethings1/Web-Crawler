A blockchain node is a computer or server that participates in a blockchain network by verifying and validating transactions and blocks on the network.","The services will help developers \"overcome the time-intensive processes and costly overhead associated with provisioning, maintaining, and operating their own dedicated blockchain nodes,\" according to a joint statement from Google Cloud and Polygon Labs.&nbsp;","Google Cloud will support all Polygon protocols, including Polygon proof-of-stake network, Polygon Supernets and Polygon zkEVM.","\u201CScaling blockchains with ZK technology eliminates the throughput bottlenecks present on existing chains, but it requires access to compute, so partnering with Google is an important step toward our ZK-powered future,\u201D Farmer said.","Over the past few years, <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/web3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Google Cloud has been increasingly expanding its presence in the web3 space<\/a> to help projects and developers.","Earlier this week, <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/startup\/web3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Google Cloud said its \"Google for Startups Cloud Program\" will now support web3 builders.<\/a> Eligible projects raising funds for pre-seed to Series A stages will be able to apply for the program, which includes up to $200,000 in Google Cloud credits over two years and other technical support.","Polygon Ventures-backed early-stage startups are eligible to participate in the program as part of the alliance.","Â© 2023 The Block.
