SoftBank is also considering putting additional money into one of the existing funds in lieu of starting a new one, the WSJ said.&nbsp;&nbsp;","The first $100 billion Vision Fund was launched in 2017, with $60 billion in investment coming from Saudi Arabian and Emirati wealth funds.","Among its highest profile investments were WeWork and the Chinese ride-hailing app Didi. The former failed spectacularly in its initial public offering of company stock in 2019, resulting in the resignation of company co-founder Adam Neumann.","Didi is also struggling due to intense scrutiny from Chinese regulators over the last year. In July, it was fined $1.2 billion following a year-long probe into how it handles data protection.","Vision Fund 2, launched in 2019, has been hit hard by the downturn in tech valuations and is down 19% from its original $49 billion invested.","A decision about the launch of the third fund is expected in the coming months.","Â© 2023 The Block.
