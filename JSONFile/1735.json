What followed was the scramble in the crypto community to buy in early to the next popular project \u2014 and the rush for non-crypto natives to understand what these types of tokens even are.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Around the same time as so-called profile-picture projects emerged, NFTs also expanded into the blockchain-based gaming sector through play-to-earn (P2E) mechanics. The P2E game Axie Infinity particularly emerged as a giant in the blockchain-based gaming space in the late summer and early fall of last year before losing traction.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In all, NFTs surpassed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/128676\/nft-trading-volume-surpassed-13-billion-in-2021\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$13 billion<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in trading volume in 2021. NFT trading volume cooled in concert with the broader crypto bear market in 2022. With high-profile parties like Coinbase and GameStop entering the space, this technology doesn\u2019t seem to be going away. With it, so too are pertinent questions around copyright and ownership.<\/span>","In this debut episode of The Block's NFT Scoop, reporter MK Manoylov speaks with The Block Research's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/author\/thomas-bialek\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thomas Bialek<\/span><\/a> about the history of NFTs, where they came from and what lead to their explosion in popularity in 2021.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this episode, Manoylov and Bialek also discuss<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">:&nbsp;<\/span><\/em>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chainalysis.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis<\/a>&nbsp;&amp;<\/em>&nbsp;<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.iwc.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IWC Schaffhausen<\/a><\/em><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About Chainalysis<\/strong><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nChainalysis is the leading blockchain data platform.
