Ethereum-compatible tokens can be transferred to Concordium's network via the Arabella bridge.","That said, even such measures may not be enough to prevent phishing attacks where the victim downloads a malicious version of the application, as was the case for Cuban.","The Concordium Foundation founder and chairman <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/concordiums-founder-lars-seier-christensen-takes-an-expanded-role-in-concordium-301755559.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">expanded his role<\/a> after Lone Fønss Schrøder stepped down as CEO in February. Christensen is also the founder and owner of the investment family office Seier Capital.","Previously, Christensen founded Denmark\u2019s Saxo Bank and ran it as CEO for 20 years. Saxo offers access to crypto through exchange-traded products and foreign exchange pairs like BTCUSD, according to its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.home.saxo\/products\/crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">website<\/a>. But the bank was ordered to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/237806\/saxo-bank-crypto-danish-regulator\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">liquidate its crypto holdings<\/a> by the Danish financial regulator in July.","Concordium recently launched its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.co.uk\/news-releases\/concordium-enables-a-new-standard-of-age-verification-amidst-growing-privacy-concerns-301928353.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Web3 ID platform<\/a>, a zero-knowledge-based identity infrastructure that leverages the Concordium identity layer, drawing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.concordium.com\/article\/learning-series-1-a-closer-look-at-concordium-and-worldcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">comparisons<\/a> to the controversial <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241871\/worldcoins-plan-to-decentralize-orb-production-sparks-illicit-data-harvesting-concerns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Worldcoin<\/a> project but without the need for eyeball-scanning Orbs.","Web3 ID enables secure and private identity verification for individuals and organizations on-chain \u2014 meaning that users can prove their identities and verify others before they interact with them, Christensen said. \u201CBecause all data is securely hosted on the blockchain, impersonation, identity falsification and, in turn, scams of this nature become close to impossible,\u201D he added.","It may seem antithetical to the crypto ethos. However, by combining zero-knowledge proof technology and Concordium\u2019s self-sovereign identity layer, Web3 ID enables users to verify their identity without sacrificing privacy, Christensen said.","Through ZK proofs and programmable ID solutions, there isn\u2019t a need to sacrifice privacy for security, according to Christensen, enabling information to remain outside of centralized hubs like exchanges \u2014 which are also prime hacking targets. \u201COnly the information necessary to validate the transaction is shared with the other party,\u201D he said. \u201CThe data is never housed outside of the entities\u2019 digital wallets, so individuals can engage in transactions with increased levels of trust and security without having to publicly share any information not directly relevant.\u201D","Concordium's Web3 ID platform is designed to heighten security while maintaining the core principles of blockchain technology, Christensen said \u2014 from decentralization to trustlessness and personal data ownership. Users share only relevant information with dapps to verify their identity, putting them in control of their data and what they share, securely hosted in a decentralized wallet, he added.","However, user credentials can be accessed in the event of legal requests from authorities. Concordium\u2019s anonymity revokers have legal rights in specific jurisdictions. There is a publicly visible registry of anonymity revokers that is curated by the Concordium Foundation. Anonymity revokers can initiate the manual process of decrypting credential data in cooperation with identity issuers \u2014 trusted entities on-boarded by the foundation and delegated with the task of validating and issuing ID credentials to users. Each on their own cannot reveal the identity of the owner of the credential, requiring a court order or some law enforcement request in their jurisdiction to initiate the unlocking process.","When asked about security and censorship concerns surrounding this process, Christensen said the platform is designed to validate and verify the data provided but not store it. \u201CPersonal data can be accessed, albeit only during the validation of transactions, it is never stored in a centralized database which protects users against any potential data exploit.\u201D","Christensen concluded that digital identity is central to almost everything in crypto and verifiable and secure digital identity solutions were needed to prevent interacting with fraudulent peers and falling victim to scams.","© 2023 The Block.
