That will be decided by a community governance vote.","\u201COver the next two weeks, we will be introducing these projects to the community via a variety of channels, including a townhall, a special channel for each project and X summaries as well,\u201D Meow said. Other projects will also be able to apply.","Alongside further product updates, Jupiter intends to initiate the Jupiter DAO with operational funds and participation incentives this month. The DAO will initially focus on evaluating and approving the launchpad projects, approving grants and releasing budgets for ongoing community and ecosystem initiatives. All launchpad fees earned from its JUP token launch \u2014 some 100 million JUP worth $54 million \u2014 will be allocated to governance participants over the first year as an incentive, Meow said.","JUP's launch did not pass without its controversy. Some users <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/Lord_Ashdrake\/status\/1752894684031008957?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">complained<\/a> about the token launch pool being used by the team to sell tokens to the public. Responding at the time, Meow <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/weremeow\/status\/1752954292313686178?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> it was transparent about the mechanics of the launch pool.","Yesterday, Meow confirmed that the pool was being closed as planned, seven days after the launch, with its 96 million JUP tokens ($52 million) removed to a cold multisig wallet and nearly 70 million USDC to be removed in $10 million batches over the next few months.","The launch pool was designed to stabilize volatile price swings and enable airdrop recipients and early buyers to sell into the pool if they chose to. \u201CHowever, this pool is not good for price discovery, due to the buy and sell walls on both sides,\u201D Meow said, adding its closure will allow JUP to regain price discovery.","JUP is currently trading at $0.54, according to The Block's data dashboard.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JUP\/USD price chart.
