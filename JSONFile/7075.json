There are criminal matters. There are allegations of [illegal] trading, commingling of funds, executives and CEOs being named personally. None of that is really an issue at Coinbase.\"","Coinbase has been in a lengthy dispute with the SEC, having <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/228047\/coinbase-sues-the-sec-for-answer-on-rule-specific-to-digital-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sued<\/a> it earlier this year in an attempt to force it to provide new rules for the digital asset industry. The regulator responded with its own lawsuit against the exchange earlier this month, accusing it of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233270\/sec-sues-coinbase-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">violating<\/a> securities law.&nbsp;","Besides the courts, Coinbase has engaged in a prominent campaign to find public support for its cause. Last month, the exchange ran a TV <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231759\/coinbase-takes-lobbying-effort-tv-ad\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ad<\/a> to confront what it said is a \"naive view\" of digital assets.","There are already signs, indeed, that crypto policy is emerging as a campaign issue, especially among challengers to the leading candidates in the race.&nbsp;","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the Republican who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232135\/desantis-promises-to-protect-bitcoin-in-presidential-campaign-launch-event\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> his presidential campaign in a Twitter Spaces event with Elon Musk last month, said he'd protect bitcoin if he's elected. On the Democrat side, candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has spoken favorably of the world's largest crypto by market capitalization.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
