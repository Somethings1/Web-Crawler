Gemini also deducted an agent fee, sometimes as high as 4.29%, from the returns Genesis paid to Gemini Earn investors. As alleged in the complaint, Genesis then exercised its discretion in how to use investors\u2019 crypto assets to generate revenue and pay interest to Gemini Earn investors.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In November 2022, Genesis said it would not allow its Gemini Earn investors to withdraw their crypto because Genesis lacked sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawal requests. At that time, Genesis held about $900 million in investor assets.

Retail investors in Gemini Earn have not be able to withdraw their crypto, the SEC said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When the Gemini Earn program shut down, Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss blasted Genesis parent company Digital Currency Group, accusing Gemini\u2019s former lending partner of defrauding thousands of Earn users and misleading them regarding DCG\u2019s solvency. Winklevoss also called for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/200442\/gemini-ceo-winklevoss-escalates-dcg-spat-demands-removal-of-silbert\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ouster of DCG CEO Barry Silbert<\/a>. Silbert denied that funds were commingled among DCG subsidiaries as Winklevoss claimed.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An SEC official said Genesis and Gemini were partners engaged in activity that constituted the offer and sale of securities without registering. Apart from the fact that Genesis was the issuer, both are liable, the official said. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CToday\u2019s charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws,\u201D said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement.&nbsp;\u201CDoing so best protects investors. It promotes trust in markets. It\u2019s not optional. It\u2019s the law.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, said he was disappointed in the SEC\u2019s action since Gemini and other creditors are working to recover funds.","\u201CThis action does nothing to further our efforts and help Earn users get their assets back,\u201D Tyler Winklevoss tweeted. \u201CTheir behavior is totally counterproductive.\u201D He added that the Earn program was regulated by New York state and had been in discussions with the SEC about the Earn program for more than 17 months.","\u201CDespite these ongoing conversations, the SEC chose to announce their lawsuit to the press before notifying us. Super lame,\u201D Tyler Winklevoss said.","DCG declined to comment on this story.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with Tyler Winklevoss' tweets and DCG's declining to comment.&nbsp;<\/em>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
