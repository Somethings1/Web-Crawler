In practice, as the beleaguered victims of crypto hacks, frauds and bankruptcy have found, sometimes the courts are the only way to get your assets back \u2013 and the Law Commission\u2019s proposals for new legislation could be offering them an extra way to do so, lawyers told CoinDesk.","Some parties to crypto litigation are also finding comfort in the Commission\u2019s report, convinced it could tip the scales in favor of a group of Bitcoin developers targeted by Craig Wright, the infamous crypto scientist who says he is the real author of the Bitcoin white paper attributed to pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.","But lawyers say the proposal doesn\u2019t address other legal concerns beyond token ownership, and that there is plenty of work left to do to ensure legal certainty and make the U.K. a crypto hub.","Politicians certainly see the Commission\u2019s proposals as welcome \u2013 including in a key cross-party parliamentary group known as the APPG on Crypto and Digital Assets, which considered legal classification issues in a recent inquiry.","\u201CThe APPG welcomes the work of the Law Commission in this important area,\u201D Lisa Cameron, the group\u2019s chair, told CoinDesk in a statement, urging the government to \u201Cmove quickly on the legal classification of these assets where this may provide further clarity for the sector, regulators and the legal system.\u201D","Legal reforms \u201Ccould help achieve the Government\u2019s goal for the U.K. to become a global hub for cryptocurrency and digital assets,\u201D added Cameron, a Westminster lawmaker for the opposition Scottish National Party, citing the ambitions first voiced by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last April when he was finance minister.","But, even before the government and lawmakers get their teeth into that, just having a clear position from the Law Commission helps offer greater certainty to those in the sector, Etay Katz, partner and head of digital assets at Ashurst law firm, told CoinDesk in an interview.","\u201CWe've got a pretty categorical statement of what the law is and should be like,\u201D Katz said. \u201CIt\u2019s as good as a statute.\u201D","There\u2019s precedent for believing the Commission\u2019s dream will become reality. Its draft bill on using blockchain for trade documents has now passed through Parliament and could have a global impact.","Likewise, the Commission\u2019s new report \u201Cpaves the way for more developments, and for English law and the English courts being seminal in matters of digital assets moving forward,\u201D Katz said \u2013 but warned there are still plenty of issues that need to be addressed.","Read more: UK Trade Groups See Opportunity in Document Bill Under Debate in Parliament","At the heart of the Commission\u2019s paper is the recommendation that \u2013 with some minor exceptions \u2013 the treatment of crypto should be left to the common law, rather than hoping lawmakers can predict every possibility in all-encompassing legislation.","Common law, determined and developed by courts, in theory allows a less rigid approach as judges can respond case by case. The Commission cites cases where judges allowed legal documents to be served via non-fungible tokens (NFT), for example, adapting legal procedures to a new reality.","Yet the legal status of digital assets still isn\u2019t completely resolved. The Commission has at best set the legal position on a particular track, but the final destination isn\u2019t set yet and the process will inevitably take time, Lizzie Williams, a managing associate at law firm Harbottle & Lewis, told CoinDesk.","But the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit set up by former Twitter chief Jack Dorsey to assist developers facing lawsuits, insisted in a July 4 blog that the Commission\u2019s report had far-reaching implications in Wright\u2019s U.K. case against a dozen Bitcoin Core developers and \u201Cundermines the central claims\u201D of the suit.","Tulip Trading\u2019s Craig Wright sued the developers, arguing they must rewrite code to give him access to 111,000 bitcoin (BTC) whose private keys were allegedly stolen.","The U.K. Court of Appeal agrees there\u2019s a serious issue to be tried, but hasn\u2019t yet given any substantive judgment on the case. The Law Commission\u2019s report refers to the case, and even suggests a rule of thumb for when developers are liable \u2013 implying there\u2019s no case to answer if they don\u2019t retain control over tokens \u2013 but the implications may not be as wide as defendants say.","\u201CThe conclusions of our report do not directly affect the question of developers\u2019 claimed fiduciary duties,\u201D though a related project underway on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) may bear on the subject, a Law Commission spokesperson told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.","While the report may constitute helpful guidance, the Law Commission is more concerned about ownership of assets than their underlying networks, Louise Abbott, partner at Keystone Law said.","Read more: Craig Wright's UK Case Against 16 Bitcoin Developers to Go to Full Trial","Some of the details still need to be nailed down in legislation. The Commission wants lawmakers in Parliament to pass a new law to clarify that people can own digital assets, even if they don\u2019t fit into the same legal category as other things you can own like cars or debts.","It also suggested reviewing the laws about the tokenization of equity and securities to see if they need to be extended to cover permissionless ledgers \u2013 a topic lobbyists such as UK Finance have also shown interest in.","One is how you treat crypto that\u2019s posted as surety for a loan \u2013 where Katz favors simply adding digital assets alongside cash and securities to an existing legislative list of permitted collateral. Another is having more consistency on the obligations of crypto custodians. Jurisdictions like the European Union have legislated on that issue \u2013 and Katz worries the U.K. is getting left behind by leaving it to individual contracts.","\u201CSo far, the U.K. is talking big words but doing very little in terms of pushing itself and positioning itself as a leader on policy,\u201D he said. While the EU\u2019s MiCA law is already finalized and set to take effect in 2024, a U.K. Treasury consultation on proposals for regulating the crypto sector has not yet been followed up with detailed provisions.","Read more: Crypto Industry Asks UK to Think Globally as Government Closes Consultation on Proposed Rules","\u201CAs a result, the bulk of the activity that is happening now in traditional finance using DLT is happening in Europe, and in Singapore and Hong Kong\u2026 I say that with an element of pain,\u201D Katz said.","Though the Law Commission findings are welcome, he believes they\u2019re not enough. \u201CWe need to move, in short order, to companies legislation, to regulation, to tax, and to any other area which is fundamentally important to the ecosystem,\u201D Katz said.","Cameron also said in May that there is more actual \u201Cscope in terms of getting comprehensive policies around innovative technology, blockchain and Web3.\u201D","Read more: How Crypto Might Shake Up England\u2019s Ancient Property Laws","Edited by Sandali Handagama."],"entity":[{"type":"Crypto Industry Asks UK to Think Globally as Government","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"England","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lizzie Williams","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Harbottle & Lewis","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Satoshi Nakamoto","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cameron","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UK Case Against 16 Bitcoin Developers","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Law Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parliament","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Louise Abbott","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"UK Finance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Keystone Law","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"July 4","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"European Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Law Commission of England","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Craig Wright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.K. Court of Appeal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wales","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DLT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto and Digital Assets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Etay Katz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Singapore","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Katz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wright","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Parliament","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rishi Sunak","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ashurst","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Lisa Cameron","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Scottish National Party","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Sandali Handagama","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Analysis","UK","Law","Crypto"],"authors":["Jack Schickler","Camomile Shumba"]}
