With what could be a potential alternative to the troubled Tornado Cash, they posit that financial privacy can co-exist with regulation.&nbsp;","The authors describe the new platform as \"a novel smart contract-based privacy-enhancing protocol\" designed to enhance transactional privacy on blockchains. Privacy Pools aims to leverage zero-knowledge proofs to determine whether user funds originated from lawful sources without revealing the complete transaction history.","The primary goal of the project is to create what the authors describe as a \"separating equilibrium.\" Simply put, the system aims to filter out funds linked to criminal activities while striving to find a balance between privacy and regulatory requirements.","\"The core idea of the proposal is to allow users to publish a zero-knowledge proof, demonstrating that their funds (do not) originate from known (un-)lawful sources, without publicly revealing their entire transaction graph,\" read the paper\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">abstract<\/a>.","The authors argued that financial privacy and regulation can co-exist. They cited Tornado Cash as a useful privacy tool, but acknowledged its susceptibility to misuse by illicit actors.","Tornado Cash faced legal difficulties last year over allegations that it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/184320\/new-treasury-sanctions-link-tornado-cash-to-north-koreas-nuclear-weapons-program\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">facilitated<\/a> transactions for the North Korea-linked hacking group Lazarus.
