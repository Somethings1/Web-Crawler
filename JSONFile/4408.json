His primary focus lately has been centered on preventing cross-chain exploits, as they pose a sizably larger amount of funds at risk due to the \u201Choneypot\u201D structure of most bridge protocols, he said in <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@0xriptide\/hackers-in-arbitrums-inbox-ca23272641a2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the report.<\/a>","His initial search for the Arbitrum exploit began a few weeks ago ahead of the Arbitrum Nitro upgrade.
