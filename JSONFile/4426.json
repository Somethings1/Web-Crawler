He argued that certain digital assets companies are still relatively undervalued when compared to public market counterparts.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThey're getting valued like traditional financial institutions, which to me, sounds like they're undervalued because the rate at which a DeFi project can grow is on a totally different scale. The profitability margin's totally different scale.\u201D Bi went on to add, \u201CIt tells me that they're actually undervalued rather than overvalued.\u201D<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
