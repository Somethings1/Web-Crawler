The issuer of failed real estate-backed stablecoin USDR plans to liquidate the token\u2019s assets and hold a redemption.","\u201COur focus now is to make users whole,\u201D Michael Slatkin, who leads marketing for USDR issuer Tangible, said in the group\u2019s Discord server late Wednesday.","Holders of USDR will be able to redeem their severely devalued stablecoins for a mix of cryptocurrency assets, some of which represent real estate in the U.K., according to an announcement on the server. It's unclear how much value the redemption process \u2013 which could take months \u2013 will ultimately return for investors.","USDR fell from its $1 peg to nearly 50 cents this week after much of the asset\u2019s DAI reserves got drained by investors fleeing the token, which is backed primarily by real estate holdings.","It\u2019s among the first high-profile failures in a niche sector of the crypto markets called real-world assets (RWA) whose proponents find various ways to tokenize more traditional investments like real estate and treasuries. The $45.5 million USDR in circulation was trading at a 44% discount at press time.","The real estate investments that represented 78% of USDR\u2019s backing also generated yields as high as 16% for its investors, according to the project. This supposedly made the stablecoin more appealing than more common dollar-pegged assets, like Circle\u2019s USDC.","But it also made it riskier. Circle keeps much of its stablecoin\u2019s reserves in highly liquid (and incredibly safe) short-term Treasury bonds. In contrast, USDR\u2019s more speculative, illiquid real estate assets can\u2019t be sold quickly to meet the bank run-like conditions that played out this week, one investor said.","Tangible, which specializes in creating such RWAs, will abandon USDR once the redemption is complete according to Slatkin\u2019s statement.","\u201CWe tried something new, we learned from the experience, and we\u2019ll keep building,\u201D Slatkin said in the announcement. \u201CNew products, both announced and unannounced, will improve on what was developed for Real USD and Tangible will continue to be a leader in the category.\u201D","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$45.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"USDR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Slatkin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"78%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"44%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"50 cents","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"late Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Treasury","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Michael Slatkin","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Real World Assets","Property","Real Estate","Stablecoins"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
