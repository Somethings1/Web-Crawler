Asia\u2019s stature in global crypto markets means it will be highly influential in shaping a more institutional market, said leading market figures during a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventussystems.com\/the-block-the-roadmap-towards-institutional-crypto-adoption-in-asia\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">webinar<\/a> organized by The Block and sponsored by Eventus Systems.<\/em>","Institutions such as pensions, endowments, family offices and even sovereign wealth funds are all investigating the place of digital assets into their portfolios. This interest will change the market, panelists said, as these investors seeking infrastructure and products emerge that meet their needs for diversification and acceptable risk parameters. In a recent report, \u2018Overview of Digital Assets and Blockchain,\u2019 Goldman Sachs notes that more than 40% of value transfer in cryptoassets takes place in Asia Pacific, and according to a Chainalysis <a href=\"https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/currencies\/asia-global-cryptocurrency-adoption-retail-investors-india-pakistan-vietnam-2021-8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">study<\/a>, the region will be front and center in shaping institutional adoption globally. In the more mature markets of North America, Western Europe, and East Asia, increasing adoption has been powered largely by institutional investors, the study found.","\u201CWhile they want to participate in the crypto megatrend, most institutions\u2019 fund covenants and operational limitations prevent them from directly accessing coins and tokens,\u201D said <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">James O'Brien, Chief Operating Officer at Valkyrie Investments<\/strong>. \u201CInstitutions turn to a range of indirect approaches to access crypto performance, such as managed accounts, funds of funds, and private funds.\u201D","\u201CMany are attracted to exchange-traded funds, which segregate the operational risk of cryptoassets from their price performance,\u201D added <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vincent Turcotte, Sales Director for Asia Pacific at Eventus<\/strong>. \u201CNon-deliverable forward (NDF) products developed by investment banks also promise to achieve this goal.\u201D And as maturing crypto service providers such as exchange platform Coinbase go public, their shares represent a conventional, regulated route to accessing crypto market growth.","&nbsp;","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Regulators are listening<\/strong>","Regulators\u2019 growing focus on market integrity and investor protection are driving changes on the part of crypto market players, Turcotte pointed out. \u201CRecognizing the benefits of greater regulatory clarity to its business, crypto infrastructure provider FTX US has joined both the Futures Industry Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) \u2013 bringing it within the traditional finance or \u2018trad fi\u2019 space,\u201D he said.","In turn, legislators and regulators are responding to crypto\u2019s growing scale and increasingly mainstream status: total market capitalization more than doubled in 2021 to $2.13 trillion. A Fidelity survey of global institutional investors in July this year found that more than half of global institutions already invest in digital assets, while in Asia, it was 71%.","And a clearer picture is beginning to emerge of <a href=\"https:\/\/forkast.news\/what-is-crypto-regulatory-outlook-hong-kong-singapore\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">how crypto will be regulated<\/a> in the region\u2019s two key international financial centers: Hong Kong and Singapore. Hong Kong is expected to introduce legislation bringing all crypto exchange licensing under its Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) \u2013 likely restricting access to professional investors \u2013 while the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has started licensing exchange operators under the country\u2019s Payment Services Act.","Cooperation between crypto actors and regulators does more than drive new regulation. \u201CBringing regulated products to the US market has been educational to product creators and to the regulators,\u201D said O\u2019Brien. \u201CIt is spurring more innovation which gives legal status to tokenized assets.\u201D","As crypto becomes more regulated, more conventional client suitability rules come into play, ensuring that investors taking on the higher leverage inherent in many crypto derivatives have the necessary sophistication and resources. \u201CRegulation will also clarify anti money-laundering (AML) and know-your-client requirements (KYC),\u201D said Turcotte. \u201CThis enables institutions to quantify and account for these risks.\u201D","&nbsp;","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Investor behavior<\/strong>","As crypto markets attract a broader range of investors, the market is bifurcating. \u201CIn the case of family offices, the smaller players run by first- or second-generation principals are aggressive yield-seekers,\u201D explained <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gerald Goh, Co-Founder and CEO of Signum Singapore,<\/strong> a digital asset specialist with a banking license in Switzerland and an asset management license in Singapore. \u201CBut others are running along institutional lines with separation between responsibilities with an investment committee more likely to implement through funds with a buy-and-hold approach.\u201D","\u201CWhile individual yield-seekers can realize 20% on their investment, institutions\u2019 risk committees will see this as signaling too much risk and are willing to trade down in return for comfort, trust and peace of mind,\u201D said Goh. \u201CAs they are often driven by the wish to diversify portfolios, a lower return is not a problem for them.\u201D","\u201CPortfolio diversification is the strongest impetus for institutions\u2019 crypto curiosity,\u201D said <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Leslie Lamb, CMO of CoinFLEX <\/strong>crypto derivatives exchange. \u201CBut what really hooks them in is understanding how the crypto yield landscape works, and how it's changing fairly quickly.\u201D","Sygnum\u2019s Goh agreed. \u201CA year ago, conversations tended to be based on simple questions like \u2018what is Bitcoin?\u2019\u201D he said. \u201CNow, queries are more nuanced, reflecting interest in volatility strategies, illiquid exposure and venture-capital type exposure \u2013 and products are changing in response.\u201D","\u201CWith more interest coming from passive allocators, the intermediary\u2019s role is to act as their trusted guide, walking them through the asset class and building products on their risk-return preferences,\u201D added Lamb at CoinFLEX. \u201COnce investors hold coins or tokens, they recognize there are a lot of uses for them \u2013 DeFi innovations open up new sources of yield, like putting their coins to work as a market-maker or liquidity provider.\u201D","The increased comfort brought by regulation will channel more activity away from unregulated platforms towards regulated institutions and financial market infrastructure, panelists said. \u201CThis will also bring investment banks into play,\u201D predicted Turcotte. \u201CThey are monitoring progress and when the opportunity versus risk equation shifts sufficiently, they will come in and package product for institutions and private banking clients.\u201D","\u201CThe core ethos underlying decentralized cryptoasset markets has always been direct market participation \u2013 and this will remain a driving force in crypto markets,\u201D added Lamb. Agreeing, Turcotte at Eventus concluded, \u201CBut constructive dialogue between investors, market service providers and regulators is propelling a rapid outgrowth of new products and services that promises to surpass the direct yield-seeking sector of the market, enabling participation from a much wider range of investors.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
