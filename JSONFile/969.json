Traditional markets, on the other hand, \"rely on coordinated fix pricing,\u201D where scandals such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) scandal of 2012, have occurred, according to Bitwise.","\u201CBitcoin\u2019s inherent fungibility and the market\u2019s distributed nature allowed for effective arbitrage to take place between different trading venues, which helped insulate bitcoin from attempts to manipulate individual markets,\u201D it added.","On the requirement of surveillance sharing, Bitwise said NYSE Arca (which filed the actual bitcoin ETF proposal for Bitwise) has a surveillance sharing agreement in place with CME through its participation in the Intermarket Surveillance Group.","\u201CAs another example, the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate that is used to settle the CFTC-regulated CME bitcoin futures contracts relies on a robust set of rules that account for data sharing and concerns about market manipulation. This rate is governed by an Oversight Committee, chaired by the CME, and draws prices from five spot bitcoin exchanges: Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, and Kraken,\u201D said Bitwise.","A similar argument was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/sec-punts-decision-on-wilshire-phoenixs-bitcoin-etf-proposal-to-february\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reportedly<\/a> also made by Wilshire Phoenix founder and managing partner William Herrmann. Wilshire has also filed a proposal with the SEC for its bitcoin and U.S. Treasury bond ETF. But the regulator, just yesterday, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/sro\/nysearca\/2019\/34-87813.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">postponed<\/a> the decision on the ETF to Feb. 26, 2020.","In Wednesday's letter, Bitwise also said that \u201Ca large number\u201D of U.S. investors are today investing in bitcoin and the need for a safe and efficient market instrument is \u201Ccritical.\u201D Bitwise cited a recent study by brokerage giant Charles Schwab, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/49451\/bitcoin-more-popular-than-netflix-stock-among-millennials-gbtc-one-of-their-top-5-equity-holdings\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">showed<\/a> that millennials have a higher holding in Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) investment product than Netflix and some other stocks.","Bitwise first filed its ETF proposal with NYSE Arca in January 2019. Since then, Bitwise has met with the SEC eight times, Hougan told The Block, adding that the firm has also submitted 500 pages of a whitepaper and a presentation on fake volume during the period.","Unfazed by rejections, Bitwise said that it is \u201Ccommitted\u201D to provide all investors with the ability to access bitcoin in a regulated and familiar fund format. \u201CWe believe such an ETF would add material protections for the millions of U.S. investors who currently use other avenues to access the bitcoin market, as well as for any future investors who may choose to do so,\u201D it concluded.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["SEC"]}
