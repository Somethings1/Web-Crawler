According to a press release, Tarbert is replacing Flavia Naves, who left Circle earlier this year.","\"The opportunity to welcome Heath's expertise and leadership to our executive team is an extraordinary step in Circle's growth as a global company,\" commented Jeremy Allaire, Circle's co-founder and CEO. \"As we continue building a bridge between traditional finance and Web3, Heath's perspective, legal acumen and global regulatory experience will help us advance the utility value of USDC worldwide.\"","The hire comes as Circle ramps up its policy efforts in Washington to build support for the crypto industry among lawmakers.

Earlier this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and Coinbase. The latter exchange launched USDC with Circle in 2018."],"hashtag":["CRYPTO BANKS AND LENDERS","FINTECH","HIRING","USDC"]}
