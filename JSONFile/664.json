The amount stated on the notice is the proposed amount that the IRS believes the taxpayers owe, although taxpayers can dispute the amounts within 30 days of receiving the notice. The agency warns that failing to respond to the letter may incur further interest owed and penalties.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In July, the IRS <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/07\/26\/irs-sends-letters-to-warn-over-10000-cryptocurrency-investors-to-report-and-pay-tax-properly\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">started sending out 10,000<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> educational letters to cryptocurrency holders, urging them to report and pay their cryptocurrency-related taxes properly. However, the CP2000 notice is believed to be separate from the 10,000 letters, according to CoinTracker co-founder Chandan Lodha, whose company provides software that helps taxpayers figure out their cryptocurrency-related taxes.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C[CP2000] is more severe [than the previous 10,000 letters] in the sense that there is an actual, specific amount that the IRS is saying that is the proposed amount due, as opposed to\u2026 a very general warning letter,\u201D said Lodha.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On one CP2000 notice shared with The Block, the IRS obtained the third-party information that it uses to calculate the proposed tax amount from a Form 1099-K, a document some cryptocurrency exchanges send out to customers that have conducted transactions above certain thresholds. Exchanges are also required to file a separate copy of the same form to the IRS.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, some cryptocurrency taxation researchers pose doubts on the IRS\u2019 methods of using Form 1099-K to calculate cryptocurrency-related taxes, since the form only reflects aggregated transaction volumes, but not the actual gains that individuals make through these transactions.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe 1099-K\u2026 isn\u2019t really a good fit for reporting cryptocurrency tax information<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">,\u201D said Coin Center senior research fellow James Foust, who specializes in cryptocurrency taxation. \u201CBut <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">it [1099-K] and the 1099-MISC are the only information reports that the IRS mentions in Notice 2014-21 and I suspect that may be the reason exchanges have opted to use it in the absence of clear guidance from the agency.\u201D&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","It is unclear how many CP2000 notices were sent out at this time.","Â© 2023 The Block.
