The IRS and DEA contract opportunities are now \u201Cinactive.\u201D","Coinbase Analytics wasn\u2019t publicly known until The Block\u2019s reporting last month. It is a software system that Coinbase built after its acquisition of intelligence agency Neutrino in 2019. The acquisition drew controversy due to Neutrino founders' involvement in the Italian spyware firm Hacking Team, and Coinbase ultimately parted ways with team members associated with Hacking Team.","Last month, Coinbase told The Block that \"[t]he information offered in Coinbase Analytics has always been kept completely separate from Coinbase internal data.\u201D","It added: \"Coinbase Analytics data is fully sourced from online, publicly available data, and does not include any personally-identifiable information for anyone, regardless of whether or not they use Coinbase. Coinbase Analytics is a blockchain analytics product that we use internally for compliance and global investigations. It's an important tool to meet our regulatory requirements and protect our customers' funds. We developed Coinbase Analytics with technology from the Neutrino acquisition.\"","Following The Block's reporting, Coinbase CEO and Co-founder Brian Armstrong took to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brian_armstrong\/status\/1282106176000233472?s=21\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a> to express his views on reporting surrounding Coinbase Analytics.
