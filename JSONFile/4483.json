McHenry R-N.C., was advanced out of the House Financial Services Committee in July 2023 but hit a snag with blame put on the White House's opposition to the bill. At the time, Rep. Waters, D-Calif., said the bill was \"deeply problematic\" due to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241749\/us-stablecoin-talks-stall-as-senior-house-republican-blames-white-house\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">provision<\/span><\/a> allowing state regulators to approve stablecoin issuances without Federal Reserve input.
