In May, Bloomberg reported that the firm was stretching beyond its custody business, preparing for the launch of broker services to trade on behalf of institutional clients. On the custody side, the firm has been courting traditional asset managers as well as crypto native firms, according to people familiar with the situation.","Fidelity Digital Assets also now joins the likes of ICE's pending crypto platform, Bakkt, which has also applied for a NY trust license to be a qualified custodian to store the bitcoin underpinning its futures contract. According to a lawyer from Gibson Dunn, Arthur Long, the trust license is \u201Cmore expansive\u201D than the famed BitLicense, a New York State license for crypto firms. <span class=\"c-message__body\" dir=\"auto\" data-qa=\"message-text\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A trust license allows a firm to operate a broader swath of services in financial markets, such as financial advice, hinting at far reaching ambitions.<\/span>","FDAS was launched last October as an offshoot of Fidelity.

The process of securing the heavily-guarded green-light from the NYDFS often takes half a year, lawyer Arthur Long told The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/05\/07\/crypto-dad-is-leaving-the-cftc-is-still-writing-the-rules-and-applicants-fall-short-d-c-sources-on-whats-holding-up-the-hottest-licenses\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in May.<\/a>","\u201CAny bank or trust company is going to have to go through a substantial process so that the regulators understand the business,\u201D he said.","For their part, FDAS are taking their time to flesh out their services. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/03\/08\/fidelitys-bitcoin-custody-business-is-live-a-conversation-with-fidelity-digital-assets-head-tom-jessop\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In an interview with The Block<\/a> earlier this year, Fidelity Digital Assets head Tom Jessop painted a picture of the firm's trading business, which will not be open to retail clientele.","\"We are not prop trading, we don\u2019t have a desk,\" he said, noting that the firm would act as an agent for clients. \"We are purely acting as effectively an agent, and that\u2019s what our clients want. Our clients want to avoid the issues associated with funding on multiple exchanges, both administrative risk, or otherwise, they want something resembling the best price experience, and so we\u2019ll try to do that by bringing liquidity providers, and other sources of liquidity onto our platform. I think effectively a smart order router, or logic, that would interrogate the market, find the best better offer, and allow the client to execute at that price.\"","He also said the firm tries to provide clients with a platform that can minimize administrative risks and locate the best price in crypto trading.","A representative for Fidelity did not respond to an inquiry prior to publication."],"hashtag":[]}
