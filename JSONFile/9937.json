The new product, Upbit Safe, will leverage Ledger Vault\u2019s hardware security technology to make trading more efficient and more secure for DXM\u2019s institutional clients.&nbsp;","Ledger Vault offers hardware security module (HSM) based solutions that allow institutions to customize governance rules depending on what type of operation they run, according to Ledger\u2019s Head of APAC Glenn Woo. He explained that while Ledger Nano X is a more well-known product, Ledger Vault is superior when it comes to institutional use cases.&nbsp;","DXM first plans to target captive customers who are already using Upbit or other cryptocurrencies that Dunamu has invested in, DXM Chief Strategy Officer Eric Yoo told The Block. Dunamu's venture capital arm, Dunamu &amp; Partners, has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesskorea.co.kr\/news\/articleView.html?idxno=31860\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">made<\/a> a three-year plan to invest $84 million in the blockchain industry and has already put in $46 million in 26 blockchain companies. Yoo believes that assets already owned by DXM\u2019s parent company will provide clients for Upbit Safe and help it succeed.","\u201CWe are a subsidiary of the largest exchange in Korea and have an advantage over our peers given that we already have a lot of assets we can bring into our custody,\u201D Yoo said. \u201CThe combination of the Upbit brand, Ledger Vault\u2019s security technology, and DXM\u2019s own technology will give DXM an edge in the Korean market.\u201D","Ledger\u2019s Asian Pacific (APAC) operations were set up about a year ago in Hong Kong to expand the company\u2019s services to countries in the region. This collaboration with DXM offers Ledger an opportunity to popularize its technology solution among Korean clients.","\u201CWe\u2019re still pretty young and we\u2019re trying to penetrate different markets with the help of partners that want to use Ledger Vault to meet their needs,\u201D said Ledger\u2019s Head of APAC Glenn Woo. \u201CDXM has a reputation of being very secure\u2026With the track record that they have in Korea, they can definitely help us scale.\u201D","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lack of regulation is the biggest hurdle in Korea<\/strong>","In Korea, Yoo said, cryptocurrency is still in its nascent stage compared to other Asian countries. Whereas retail investors are considerably ahead compared to those outside Korea, institutional finance is somewhat dormant due to legal uncertainty and lack of regulation.","There is currently no comprehensive guidance from regulatory authorities regarding how cryptocurrency should operate under the law, according to research by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globallegalinsights.com\/practice-areas\/blockchain-laws-and-regulations\/korea\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Global Legal Insights<\/a>. In 2017, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) announced that cryptocurrencies are not fiat currencies, electronic currencies, or financial investment instruments, but did not specify how exactly it should be classified. As a result, it remains unclear what regulatory standards and restrictions cryptocurrencies are subject to.","Compared to countries such as Indonesia where the government\u2019s financial body has put out detailed regulations and licensing rules for crypto exchanges, Yoo said, Korea has not seen a clear guideline.","\u201CThe biggest regulatory risk in Korea is uncertainty and lack of regulations,\u201D Yoo said. \u201CIt\u2019s quite a Wild Wild West out there.\u201D","In recent years, Korea's National Assembly has proposed several cryptocurrency bills that try to spell out licensing requirements, anti-laundering requirements, consumer protection, cybersecurity requirements, among others, Global Legal Insights\u2019 report shows. Yoo believes that such regulatory attempts will come to fruition within the first half of 2020, and DXM will capture newly empowered institutional investors and smart money that will flow into the space.","\u201CWe are one of the few companies in Korea to actually hope for regulations to form out,\u201D Yoo said. \u201COnce regulations become clearer, it\u2019d be easier for us to engage with institutional money and not take the risks from uncertainties.\u201D","Woo agrees that DXM and Ledger are prepared to deal with future regulations and believes Ledger can benefit from Dunamu\u2019s experience with and expertise in the traditional finance market.","\u201CWith Dunamu and DXM, we do not see regulation as a problem at all,\u201D Woo said. \u201CI\u2019ve worked with them for almost a year now. They have people such as Eric Yoo who are coming from traditional finance. They understand how the traditional market works and wants to apply it to the new crypto world.\u201D","\u201CWhereas a lot of crypto companies have to walk on thin ice and are taking a lot of risks, Dunamu\u2019s people have a very good understanding of the Korean regulations\u2014what\u2019s coming up, if there are risks, and how they can properly mitigate new risks, he said. \"So I\u2019m very confident that they\u2019ll always do the right thing.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
