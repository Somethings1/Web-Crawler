The report reads:","The report, titled  \u2018Digitizing Trust: Leveraging the Bitcoin Protocol Beyond the \"Coin\"\u2019, cites the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s October decision to allow meta data to be embedded in the blockchain as opening the door for people to \u201Cleverage the blockchain protocol in other ways beyond traditional financial transactions\u201D.","At its core, bitcoin is merely a way of recording transactions without the need for a central authority to confirm or verify those transactions.","The bitcoin protocol creates a digital ledger, called the \u201Cblockchain\u201D, tracking each and every transaction on the network. That ledger is stored and updated not by a central bank, but by every single person who downloads the bitcoin software.","Therefore it is decentralized. Whenever a new transaction occurs, the record of that transaction propagates through the network and everyone updates their ledgers.","This distributed and decentralized system, backed by cryptography, does away with the need for trust in the \u201Chaving to take someone\u2019s word for it\u201D sense \u2013 everything can be checked and verified digitally on the ledger.","(Of course, this is a simplified explanation and not the whole story. This video gives an in-depth view of the bitcoin protocol.)","The bitcoin blockchain, for a long time, only contained data about transactions, but in October 2013 Bitcoin\u2019s lead developer Gavin Andresen \u201Creluctantly\u201D allowed other data to be embedded into the blockchain. He said:","So potentially, a person could store data about a legal contract there. Here\u2019s how Gil Luria explains the concept:","The current bitcoin software only allows developers to add 80 bytes of other data to transactions, so the argument is less that bitcoin right now could become a system for enforcing legal documents, but rather that a bitcoin-esque system of decentralised trust could prove powerful in domains outside of traditional financial transactions.","\"We believe the protocol will be leveraged beyond financial assets and fulfill the role of trusted intermediary in a variety of settings, including property, legal documents, escrow and sports betting,\" write Luria and Turner in the report.","Investment from venture capitalists in bitcoin businesses really began to take off in 2013, with Coinbase raising $25m, BitPay raising $2m and Circle raising $9m.","According to the report, this level of investment will continue in 2014, allowing new innovation in the bitcoin space and the creation of technologies that will make bitcoin truly accessible to the mainstream, just as the creation of web browsers opened up the internet to new audiences.","\u201CVCs that are not currently involved are looking for ways not to miss the trend,\u201D says Luria.","Standing in the way of innovation is the increasingly hostile regulatory environment. China, India and the United States have all taken steps to restrict and regulate the operation of bitcoin businesses.","\u201CI think the regulatory environment is more set than it seems,\u201D says Luria, warning against undue optimism that regulators will change tack in 2014.","But with the bitcoin market burgeoning \u2013 BitPay says it gets 400 new merchant requests a day and Wedbush\u2019s report estimates over $200m was spent on bitcoin mining equipment in 2013 \u2013 it remains to be seen whether or not these countries are shooting themselves in the foot by clamping down on bitcoin.","\u201CInnovation and innovators gravitate to the country with the most accommodating regulatory environment,\u201D notes the Wedbush report.","And now, with the potential for bitcoin technology to change not only payments and money transfers but other legal arenas, the stakes have never been higher."],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aaron Turner","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Gil Luria","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wedbush Securities","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Luria","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Turner","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wedbush","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$25m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$200m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Circle","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"India","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gavin Andresen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$9m","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin Protocol","Wall Street","Lifestyle","News"],"authors":["Kadhim Shubber"]}
