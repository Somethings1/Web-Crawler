As a result, Son ended up investing around $200 million or so in bitcoin at the time, he said. But the bitcoin market's high volatility became so much of a distraction for Son that he ended up selling bitcoin at a loss of around $50 million or so.","\"I was looking at the price every day...up and down. I said, this is no good. This is something I don't understand. My mindshare is somewhat affected...this was distracting my focus on my own business,\" said Son. \"So I said okay I would sell whatever the price and I sold with some loss, maybe I lost [$] 50 million, I don't know...I forgot.\"","Last year, there were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/softbank-founder-masayoshi-son-lost-130-million-on-bitcoin-11556017200\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reports that said<\/a> Son invested in bitcoin at peak prices in 2017 and sold it in early 2018 at a loss of more than $130 million.","The price of bitcoin has been rallying recently, having crossed $18,000, but it still doesn't attract Son's attention. At the conference, Son said bitcoin today \"maybe more than the price I sold, but I feel so much better because at least I don't have to put my mind in something I don't understand.\"","Son still believes that digital currency is the future, but his focus is on artificial intelligence (AI) now.&nbsp;","\"I think digital currency is definitely going to be useful with the security and so on...but I don't know what digital currency, what structure...I would rather focus my 300 years for something that I feel passionate [about], which is the AI focus right now,\" said Son.","Son, 63, recorded a personal net worth of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Masayoshi_Son\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">around $30 billion<\/a> as of August 2020.","Â© 2023 The Block.
