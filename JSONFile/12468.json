Hope you think it is worth it. I don\u2019t think it is. I don\u2019t know what I did wrong. But if it is just money, I think you are making a mistake,\u201D Kodrič told Hong at the time, according to the judgement filing. Another extract shows that Kodrič told Dan Morehead, founder and CEO of Pantera Capital, that it looked as though Hong was forcing him out of the company.","Former Starling Bank COO Julian Sawyer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/81925\/former-gemini-europe-bitstamp-new-ceo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">took over<\/a> at CEO of Bitstamp in July the 2020. When reached, Sawyer said the lawsuit was a private matter that doesn't impact the company's strategy.&nbsp;","Kodrič was contacted for comment but did not respond by press time.","© 2023 The Block.
