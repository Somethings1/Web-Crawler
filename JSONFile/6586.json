We've done a lot of yelling at people to use different clients. There [are] a lot of people voluntarily doing those things because it's good for the security of the network, but it's not healthy to over-index on those things.\u201D<\/span>","The Ethereum liquid staking protocol Lido has a total value locked (TVL) of $34.3 billion, as per <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/total-value-locked-tvl\/value-locked-in-liquid-staking\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block\u2019s Data Dashboard<\/a>. Lido's high TVL makes it the biggest validator on the proof-of-stake blockchain Ethereum, controlling 30% of staked ether. While Lido is a single protocol, it works with over 35 entities to run the nodes and manage the block production process. Other large staking service providers like Coinbase and Binance also control large amounts of ETH stakes.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/total-value-locked-tvl\/value-locked-in-liquid-staking\/embed\" title=\"Value Locked in Liquid Staking\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","In a February post on a forum for Ethereum researchers, Barnabé Monnot of the Ethereum Foundation introduced \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/ethresear.ch\/t\/unbundling-staking-towards-rainbow-staking\/18683\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rainbow staking<\/a>\u201D as a strategy to decentralize staking activities.

What is the approach for them to participate?\u201D He elaborated, \u201Cif we don\u2019t give a realistic answer, they\u2019re just going to like dump all their money into a centralized thing\u2026 If we have a good answer to this, then I think it should be possible to build a very secure, very robust staking economic design around it.\u201D","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
