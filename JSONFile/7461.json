As I said, it's almost a fundamental rule of networks. And so we want people to be able to innovate on related but different protocols to Bitcoin so that we're not having to constantly fight over changing the base protocol,\u201D he added.","Lopp mentioned existing sidechain projects like Blocksteam\u2019s Liquid Network and Rootstock, but acknowledged that they tend to be based around federations \u2014 noting that that might be the reason why adoption of such protocols has stalled.&nbsp;","Lopp mentioned a few sidechain ideas that have been proposed recently, including drivechains, spiderchain and BitVM. Each of these attempts to provide new ways to build layers on top of Bitcoin, with the latter attempting to introduce similar capacities to Ethereum.","\u201CWe need to keep allowing the new functionality to happen because that can have an order of magnitude multiplier effect of what people are able to do on these other layers,\u201D Lopp argued.","He clarified that he wasn\u2019t proposing or backing any one idea; he wants all of these ideas to flourish. \u201CI want the experimentation to keep happening and I think the only way forward is to continue building, failing, learning from the failures and evolving. And so, you know, ossification is going to happen, but we need to keep racing forward and get as far as we can before that actually happens.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
