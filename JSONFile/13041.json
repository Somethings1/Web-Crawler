It could be that the research institute is soliciting insights on the ride-hailing industry from the company, or that they are jointly developing technology that allows DCEP to be integrated with the existing transportation system. Either way, one might be getting ahead of themselves for thinking that Didi will soon accept DCEP on its platform solely on the basis of this week's announcement.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, this is not to say that Didi may not be more involved in the DCEP deployment plan.

So if Didi or other consumer-facing tech companies want to trial DCEP, they most likely have to work with these banks and integrate with their wallets to make that happen.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In fact, other tech companies, including food delivery platform Meituan-Dianpin and video-streaming site Bilibili, have already teamed up with some of these banks to utilize DCEP, according to Caixin.
