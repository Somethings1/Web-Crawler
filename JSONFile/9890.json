Unidentified executives from Celestia, Cosmos, StarkWare, Filecoin and other blockchain ecosystems also participated in the round, Lava added.","Lava was founded in 2022. The firm's CEO, Yair Cleper, said the seed round closed last December. He declined to comment on the structure of the round and valuation.","Lava is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270037\/the-block-researchs-analysts-2024-predictions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">modular blockchain network<\/a> focused on providing data access through remote procedure calls (RPCs) and indexing. In web3, application developers need to make RPC requests to send and retrieve blockchain data, while indexing helps them get specific data from a blockchain network.","\u201CDevelopers use Lava to retrieve and send blockchain data (\u2018access blockchains\u2019),\u201D Cleper said. \u201CNew chains and APIs are added permissionlessly to Lava, which means the network can dynamically and quickly support access to all of web3.\u201D","Lava can be compared with the popular modular blockchain network <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/260167\/modular-network-celestia-goes-live-on-mainnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Celestia<\/a>, but the latter is focused on data availability, and the former is focused on data access, Cleper said. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe Lava network is currently in testnet. Last month, it launched an incentivized public RPC service on NEAR, Evmos, Axelar, and other blockchains and plans to add more chains in the near future.","Blockchain node operators join Lava and get rewarded for providing performant RPCs. \u201CRewards are distributed based on volume served and quality of service, i.e., speed, uptime, and accuracy, thereby optimizing performance for developers and users,\u201D Cleper said.","Lava aims to launch its mainnet in the first half of this year. There are currently 26 people working for Lava, 20 of which are blockchain engineers, Cleper said, adding that the project is looking to hire more people.","Lava aims to introduce its modular approach to oracles, sequencing, and other blockchain data infrastructure in the future, serving as a \"permissionless everything store for any web3 service.\"","Ahead of its mainnet, Lava has today introduced a reward points program called Magma. Users can earn Magma points by switching their RPC connection to Lava, Cleper said. He declined to comment on whether Magma points will be redeemable for Lava\u2019s own token in the future.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/276219\/filecoin-protocol-glif-funding-reward-points-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Points<\/a> are becoming increasingly popular among crypto projects to reward loyal users.
