Thus far, the book has proved to be chock full of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/254666\/cz-declined-to-pay-40-million-to-sbf-for-futures-exchange-going-infinite\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">juicy details<\/a> Lewis claims to have observed or discovered while researching it.","\"At the moment of its collapse, FTX had more than ten million account holders, to whom it owed $ 8.7 billion,\" Lewis wrote in one passage. \"Nearly half of those losses, or $4 billion, were concentrated in these fifty accounts ... Near the top was Jump Trading ($ 206,160,600.00), and at the bottom was Virtu Financial Singapore ($ 10,095,336.83).\"","Bankruptcy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/254667\/anthropics-new-raise-could-mean-full-payout-for-ftx-creditors-lawyer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proceedings<\/a> that will determine how much money creditors recoup is currently underway.&nbsp;Lewis' publicist did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Since the book's arrival and Lewis' appearance on long-time news show \"60 Minutes,\" the author has again been the subject of criticism, especially for his comments about FTX's performance as a company. The collapsed crypto exchange began bankruptcy proceedings late last year after millions of customers lost their money.","Virtu's spokesperson took another shot at Lewis' credibility, saying the author's claims about the $10 million lost are \"as accurate as his understanding of market structure in 'Flash Boys.'\"","Published in 2014, Lewis' book on high frequency trading has been lambasted by some critics for its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/buttonwoods-notebook\/2014\/05\/07\/hft-the-backlash-continues\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">depiction<\/a> of the subject matter and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2014\/11\/24\/hft-critic-michael-lewis-dead-wrong-author.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">alleged<\/a> inaccuracies.","During an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/206253\/virtu-continues-to-see-crypto-as-a-long-term-growth-opportunity\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">earnings call<\/a> at the beginning of this year, Virtu's CEO Doug Cifu said that \"although we had an approximate 8-figure fiat and coin balances deployed across several venues when the FTX news broke, we acted quickly and did not realize any material losses.\"","As a global market maker in equities and other financial products, Virtu commands a relatively low profile within crypto. In addition to making markets in crypto exchange traded funds, its CEO has described crypto as a \"long-term growth opportunity.\"","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
