The underlying claims in the reports were \u201Cnonsensical,\u201D submitted by individuals \u201Ctotally lacking in web3 security skills who were hoping that web3 bug bounty hunting would be as easy as entering in some ChatGPT prompts,\u201D Immunefi added.","Permanent bans that Immunefi placed on any accounts found using the tool now account for 21% of all banned accounts.","\u201CThe industry must thoroughly assess every tool it plans on including in its security arsenal. At the moment, ChatGPT is not a reliable one. For web3 security, namely vulnerability discovery, the technology is just not there,\u201D Immunefi founder and CEO Mitchell Amador said.","Immunefi conducted a broader ChatGPT web3 security survey as part of the report, finding that 76.4% of whitehats have used the tool in their web3 security practices, with 36.7% using it as part of their daily workflow.&nbsp;","Some 52.1% of respondents had a positive sentiment toward ChatGPT, 38.8% neutral and 9.1% negative, with some 68.4% recommending the tool to web3 security colleagues. Some 73.9% of the whitehats saw ChatGPT as suitable for education, 60.6% for smart contract auditing and 46.7% for vulnerability discovery.&nbsp;","However, concerns arose among 64.2% of the group regarding the technology's limited accuracy in identifying vulnerabilities, with 61.2% highlighting its lack of specific knowledge and challenges in handling large-scale audits.","While 52.1% of whitehats said the general use of ChatGPT presents security concerns, with its potential for phishing, scams and social engineering, the majority of the community (75.2%) still believes that it has the potential to improve web3 security research. To mitigate the risks, the community said there was a need for strong governance frameworks, strict access controls and ongoing monitoring.","Immunefi claims to have paid out more than <a href=\"https:\/\/immunefi.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$80 million<\/a> in bounties and saved over $25 billion in user funds across protocols like Chainlink, The Graph, Synthetix and MakerDAO. The highest bounty facilitated by Immunefi being a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/148085\/wormhole-announces-10-million-bug-bounty-payout\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$10 million<\/a> award for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/132841\/256-million-in-eth-stolen-from-cross-chain-protocol-wormhole\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">vulnerability<\/a> discovered in Wormhole\u2019s cross-chain protocol.&nbsp;","Earlier this month, Immunefi <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/237791\/crypto-attacks-losses-q2-immunefi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">found<\/a> there were 63% more crypto attacks last quarter compared to a year ago.","Â© 2023 The Block.
