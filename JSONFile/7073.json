Once a halving event occurs, miners receive 50% fewer bitcoins as a reward for every block of transactions they mine and add to the blockchain. However, they continue to earn additional transaction fees for each block mined as normal.","There have been three halving events in Bitcoin's history, reducing its block reward inflation from 50 BTC to 25 BTC in 2012, then to 12.5 BTC in 2016 and 6.25 BTC at the last halving on May 11, 2020. In the long term, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence. The halving events will continue until the last bitcoin is expected to be mined around the year 2140. After this, miners will only earn from transaction fees.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin inflation over time.

While not a direct cause-and-effect relationship, these events have often preceded substantial bull runs in the bitcoin market.","This time round, bitcoin\u2019s price is closer to all-time highs at this point before a halving event than ever before \u2014 hitting a high of $64,000 earlier this week to come within 10% of November 2021\u2019s record of around $69,000 following the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States in January.","\u201C$60,000 BTC is just the latest milestone for this new crypto bull market.

It's one for which we've spent years preparing.
