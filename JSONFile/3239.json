Others, like Marathon, do so strategically, constantly evaluating the cost of capital to determine if we should sell bitcoin or utilize equity or debt to fund growth,\" Marathon's VP of Corporate Communications Charlie Schumacher said in an email to The Block.","\"One thing that does seem to have changed is financial institutions have become more sophisticated with the products they're offering to miners. Hedging services are becoming increasingly more common and curated. While Marathon does not hedge its bitcoin holdings today, we are constantly evaluating ways to leverage our bitcoin holdings and mitigate any risks to the company,\" Schumacher added.","Yesterday, The Block broke the news that Fidelity is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236588\/fidelity-preparing-to-submit-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing-source\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">close<\/a> to submitting its own filing for a spot bitcoin ETF, following similar <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235753\/wisdomtree-invesco-and-blackrock-are-now-all-gunning-for-a-bitcoin-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">submissions<\/a> by Wisdom Tree, Bitwise, Invesco and Valkyrie in the race recently restarted by BlackRock.","Bitcoin is up over 20% since BlackRock\u2019s filing, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to CoinGecko data.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated with comment from Marathon.<\/em>","© 2023 The Block.
