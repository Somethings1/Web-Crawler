That\u2019s not going to be fun.\u201D","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">US efforts to potentially develop its own central bank digital currency in such an environment also spells trouble, though the Fed itself hasn't given the official green-light on this front. As Woo discussed during the interview:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf we go back to the 70s situation where they are printing money... you think they are just going to encourage people to go into Bitcoin?\" He went on to add, \"Once you have CBDC, they are going to know every cent you have... Everything is going to be under government control, and at that point, they\u2019re going to crack down on bitcoin like mad.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To illustrate his point, Woo pointed to China, where <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/98925\/pboc-anonymous-cbdc-not-option\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the launch<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> of a CBDC resulted in&nbsp; a harsh <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/118581\/china-issues-tougher-measures-to-keep-cracking-down-on-crypto-trading\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crackdown<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> on services facilitating the exchange of fiat currencies and crypto assets.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Woo, the main reason the US has yet to crack down on Bitcoin is political. He explains:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe main reason is because the government in the US doesn\u2019t want to take the side of the banks... The banks represent the established monopolies, the payment system, the dinosaurs and that Bitcoin represents the new kid on the block that\u2019s going to make everything more efficient. Even if they think crypto is a bit speculative, they\u2019re afraid to crack down too hard because they are going to be accused of basically being pro-Wall Street.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Despite the political unpopularity, Woo believes the creation of an American CBDC and the accompanying crypto crackdown is inevitable:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CChina just launched their CBDC\u2026Nobody wants China to get ahead, so America needs to basically show that the US is not ready to surrender the dollar\u2019s reserve currency status in this new struggle.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Earlier this month the Biden Administration issued an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/137013\/white-house-releases-text-of-bidens-crypto-focused-executive-order\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">executive order<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> which, among other things, \u201Cplaces the highest urgency on research and development efforts into the potential design and deployment options of a United States CBDC.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Woo suggests that it is this particular event that will have a profound impact on Bitcoin: <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COnce you have a [CBDC], do you not think the attitude towards Bitcoin is going to change completely?\u201D<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Woo and Chaparro also discuss:<\/span><\/i>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fireblocks.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/coinbase.com\/prime\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase Prime<\/a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/chainalysis.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.
