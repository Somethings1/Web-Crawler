The price of ETH has lost almost 70% of its dollar value since the start of the year.","NFTs have also followed the broader market downturn with floor prices of even the popular collections falling <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/151754\/nft-floor-prices-are-falling-along-with-the-broader-crypto-market\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">by almost 33% in June<\/a>.

This previous owner bought the NFT from the original minter in the summer of 2017 for 8 ETH ($1,646 at the time) and held on to it for almost five years before selling it.","Â© 2023 The Block.
