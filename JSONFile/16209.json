The news came unexpectedly last week, after a long-time Urbit user known as ~doplur announced the project and an associated token airdrop on Twitter and internal Urbit message rooms \u2013 causing a fair amount of consternation and debate.","The launch of the community-driven project, dubbed Urbit Virtual Machine (UVM), represents the latest step the controversial Urbit project has taken into the world of crypto, as Urbit insiders attempt to build what they call \"sound computer\" infrastructure. It also highlights how a recent surge in public interest and developer count could lead Urbit to places never envisioned or desired by its committed user base.","This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","The blockchain is what\u2019s known as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a type of cryptocurrency network built to run decentralized applications that could plug into and replicate the things built on Ethereum, the world\u2019s second-largest blockchain.","See also: 'More Bang for Less Byte': ICOs Confront Growing Pains | (2017)","\"For better or worse, EVM is the language of DeFi,\" doplur said in an interview at the Assembly conference in Miami last weekend, referring to decentralized finance. \"There is a huge amount of capital on Ethereum, and if we want Urbit to be relevant there needs to be a way to communicate between the networks.\"","The launch of UVM comes at a time when Urbit coders are actively attempting to court decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and DeFi to the platform. Its suite of applications, many of which launched in recent months, could rival centralized crypto mainstays like Discord and Slack. The recently launched Uqbar Ethereum layer 2 network gives Urbit native crypto utility.","\"While they are trying to grow adoption, I don\u2019t think the Urbit community necessarily want 'crypto types' to invade overnight and dilute the mission, at least not until there is immunity against the meaningless charades we see in crypto,\" Michelle Lai, an early Anchorage Digital hire and Urbit enthusiast, said.","For some in Urbit, UVM\u2019s airdrop and white paper was reminiscent of the initial coin offering boom of in 2017 \u2013 a period now remembered for its litany of unfinished projects and outright scams, when \u201Ccrypto devs\u201D could raise millions of dollars from retail investors looking to buy into projects like \u201Cdecentralized Uber\u201D or \u201CDentacoin.\u201D","\"They shipped before they had a usable product,\" Lane Rettig, a core developer of crypto community Spacemesh and former Ethereum Foundation coder, said. Urbit\u2019s message boards were lit up with people questioning whether the functionality would ever be needed, he added, though Rettig chose to withhold his own opinion on the matter.","Urbit, which was founded by controversial blogger Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug) and which was built primarily by the company he founded and stepped back from, Tlon, hasn\u2019t followed the traditional model of network development favored by the Silicon Valley software industry (often summed up as \u201Cmove fast and break things\u201D).","See also: Urbit Is Web3, Weird and Wonderful and I Don't Care Who Built It","Instead, it has unfolded slowly \u2013 aiming for the grandiose aim of giving everyone a personal server from which to run any type of computer application (like email, web browsing and online payments). Initially, the janky virtual computer was accessible only by the command line. For years, essentially the only service available was a stripped-down messaging platform and weather app.","\"For anyone who has followed the project, it seems like an organic process,\" Pax Dickinson, former chief technology officer of Business Insider and founder of Urbit infrastructure builder Wexman Systems, said in an interview. To date, Urbit was built primarily by the well-funded San Fransisco-based organization Tlon, which allowed it to take shape deliberately \u2013 from its two bespoke programming languages on up \u2013 and follow a clear roadmap.","Doplur's UVM system is among the first major projects to go live on Urbit without Tlon's involvement or funding from one of its sister agencies, like the Urbit Foundation. Doplur said he started work on the project a few months ago after \"Urbit NYC Week,\" and hopes to receive financial support for his efforts \"some day.\"","It's worth noting that one of crypto's great innovations is the ability to self-fund projects through token launches \u2013 solving what is sometimes called the \"cold start problem\u201D of gaining potential users and financial runway for a new network. However, Lai and Rettig both note how one of Urbit's charms is that it has avoided the \"financialization\" of crypto so far.","\"You\u2019ll find people who hate crypto here,\" Lai said. Assembly, the Miami conference, brought together a number of high-profile speakers from the world of crypto (including figures like Balaji Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer of crypto exchange Coinbase and DAO expert Aaron Wright) and the wider culture world (like author Walter Kirn, filmmaker Alex Lee Moyer and internet historian Katherine Dee).","For years, users of Urbit were self-filtering: Only those that could grok its peculiar argot and understand the tech ended up staying around. But the project is rapidly gaining cultural relevancy, and efforts are being made to more easily onboard users.","The new token was airdropped to 4.5 million Ethereum addresses, including all users who have an .eth wallet address as well as all Urbit \u201Cship\u201D holders, in an attempt to spur adoption, doplur said. The blockchain\u2019s validation process will open this week, giving people a chance to stake their tokens and earn yield. A healthy fraction of the tokens was held in reserve to pay for later network development, including bridges to Ethereum, privacy tools and scaling products.","\"We noticed our first meme coin a few hours after launch! We are excited to see what the community comes up with,\" doplur said. $URBIT is not yet fully bridged to the wider crypto economy, and doesn\u2019t yet have a price.","Although the $URBIT launch has yet to break into the wider crypto conversation, it is a possible sign of difficult conversations to come as Urbit continues to grow. Permissionless systems are open for anyone to add onto and use, probably in ways that a network\u2019s first group of highly committed users never intended.","\"Nothing on Urbit needs to be sanctioned! It's open source, public infrastructure. Anything can build anything they want. In general, it's great for the system when people experiment,\" Tlon CEO Galen Wolfe-Pauly said via email. He added that \u201CUrbit will definitely be a place where commerce happens\u201D and tokens are to be expected.","Doplur said a more decentralized EVM chain tethered to Urbit could also encourage Ethereum developers to \u201Crefocus\u201D on censorship resistance, amid rising concerns about potential network takeovers after Ethereum\u2019s shift to a proof-of-stake system and the government sanctioning of Tornado Cash, the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency mixer.","Urbit\u2019s official Twitter account said users should approach UVM with \u201Ccaution.\u201D","\"I\u2019m not connecting my (digital wallet) MetaMask for this 'free AirDrop',\" Lai said, showing how she\u2019s being cautious for now.","UPDATE (SEPT. 27, 2022 \u2013 23:55 UTC): Adds context about UVM's founding.","CORRECTION (SEPT. 28, 2022 \u2013 13:10 UTC): Corrects Josh Lehman's title in the photo caption.","CORRECTION (OCT. 4, 2022 \u2013 18:10 UTC): Pax Dickinson's company is Wexpert Systems, not Wexman Systems.
