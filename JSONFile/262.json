Users will then be able to take a long or short position via ether (ETH), betting if BTC will go up or down from that initial position, determined by Band\u2019s decentralized data oracle. \u201CIf you are correct, you double the amount of ETH you put in otherwise you lose your stake,\u201D Srinawakoon told The Block.","Indeed, that\u2019s how binary options work - more like a prediction, which can either be right or wrong, but nowhere in between.","Admitting that the one-minute window is \u201Ctoo short,\u201D Srinawakoon said that the window will be expanded as well as more cryptocurrencies will be added to show the potential of decentralized finance or DeFi.","Band Protocol said the testnet launch of BitSwing helped it earn $12,000 worth of testnet ETH in data query fees in its first two weeks. \"If the trend continues, Band Protocol is expected to generate over $300,000 in value per annum for its ecosystem via BitSwing alone.\"","Srinawakoon told The Block that query fees are paid to data providers as an incentive to provide \u201Caccurate\u201D data and are paid by dApps who query the data. He added that it is similar to how centralized applications pay for API (application programming interface) access to retrieve data from other websites. Band Protocol gets its price data from sources including CoinGecko, Binance and Upbit and others.","The launch of mainnet and BitSwing follows Band Protocol\u2019s initial exchange offering <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/bandprotocol\/band-protocol-binance-launchpad-summary-de2b8cb1e39a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">(IEO) on Binance Launchpad<\/a> earlier this month via its native token BAND. The firm raised $5.85 million through the IEO, bringing its total funding to date to $10.85 million.","When asked why Band Protocol needs its own token, Srinawakoon told The Block that \u201Csimilar to how BTC is needed to incentivize miners to act honestly, BAND tokens are used to incentivize data providers to provide accurate data and for token holders to vote for the most trusted data provider to ensure data integrity.\u201D","He added that the firm will continue to work with Binance and other cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure \u201Cmaximum liquidity for our tokens to the widest audience globally,\" concluding:","\u201CWe are fully decentralized so our revenue will come from our staked tokens. We will use most of our tokens to stake for data providers and earn part of query fees. This ensures our long term sustainability as we do not depend solely on the token\u2019s volatile price.\u201D"],"hashtag":[]}
