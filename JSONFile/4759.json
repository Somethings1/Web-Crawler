The merge will take place once the total terminal difficulty reaches 58750000000000000000000, which according to Vitalik, will be around Sept.15, 2022. After many years of discussion, Ethereum will finally be transitioning from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake - dropping energy usage for the blockchain and reducing issuance. With a significant change on the horizon, traders are wondering how to gain exposure to this monumental event in crypto history. Let's dive into some assets that have exposure to the merge.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rocket Pool (RPL)<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum 2.0 staking pool. With Rocket Pool, node operators can stake as little as 16 ETH and receive the remaining 16 ETH to stake from rETH holders. This model helps node operators earn more yield on their ETH and enables the public to take part in staking without needing to operate a node.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Using the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dex.guru\/token\/0xd33526068d116ce69f19a9ee46f0bd304f21a51f-eth\/profile\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DexGuru trading terminal<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, we can see that Rocket Pool's native token, RPL, is trading at around $25 (at the time of writing), with a recent low in June at $7.69. With a maximum circulating supply of 18,686,472 tokens - RPL is resting at a fully diluted valuation of $482 million. As we can see, the price movement has been green heading into the merge, and it will be great to observe whether these trends continue or we see a reversal once ETH staking is live and earning yield!<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lido Finance (LDO)<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:80,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Like Rocket Pool, Lido Finance lets users earn yield off their ETH by staking it for their yield generating token, stETH.
