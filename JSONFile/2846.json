To the contrary, the contracts that Ripple has entered into explicitly exclude general XRP holders as third-party beneficiaries.\"","They argued that like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), which U.S. regulators have deemed not to be securities, XRP is \"sufficiently decentralized to avoid regulation as a security.\"","U.S. regulators have yet to declare whether XRP is a security. Earlier this year, CFTC chairman Heath Tarbert <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/52916\/its-unclear-whether-xrp-is-security-or-commodity-says-cftc-chairman\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> the status of XRP is \u201Cunclear\u201D at the moment. He added that the CFTC had been working closely with the SEC over the last year \u201Cto really think about which falls in what box.\"","Under the SEC\u2019s Howey Test, a security is essentially an investment in which the investor has an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others.","\u201CThe mere fact that an individual holds XRP does not create any relationship, rights or privileges with respect to Ripple any more than owning ether would create a contract with the Ethereum Foundation, the organization that oversees the Ethereum architecture,\u201D they wrote.","As for the fact that the company itself holds a large supply of its own token, Giancarlo and Bahlke wrote: \"Even though Ripple holds a large stake of XRP in escrow and funds its operations through the sale of XRP, this is no different than bitcoin miners selling mined tokens\"","Further, they argued, Ripple has not marketed XRP as an investment product and has \u201Crepeatedly emphasized the functionality of XRP as a liquidity tool and a settlement mechanism.\u201D&nbsp;","Instead of a security, XRP should be considered a currency or a medium of exchange, they said. \u201CThe increased adoption of XRP as a medium of exchange and a form of payment in recent years, both by consumers and in the business-to-business setting, further underscores the utility of XRP as a bona fide fiat substitute.\u201D"],"hashtag":["CFTC","XRP"]}
