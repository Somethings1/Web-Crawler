Representing 13% of the coin's supply, it's the second-largest volume of tokens to be unlocked in any Solana epoch and it is coming amid a time of considerable tumult in the crypto market.","An epoch refers to a number of slots (like blocks) on the chain and takes around two to three days. Data from Solana Compass <a href=\"https:\/\/solanacompass.com\/validators\/change?epoch=370\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shows<\/a> that Epoch 370, the current Solana network epoch, is set to end at around 8.30 AM UTC on Nov. 10. Solana epochs refer to a time period, usually two days, when validators lock in their stake on the network. Validators can choose to unlock their stake at the end of each epoch.","The website's dashboard currently shows over 47 million sol tokens scheduled to be unlocked by validators. This number has increased from 18 million in the space of a few hours. The increase likely indicates that more validators are choosing to remove their staked tokens from the network.","In contrast, only 1.8 million sol ($36 million) is scheduled to be staked at the end of the current epoch.","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Solana (SOL) is down 36% today.
