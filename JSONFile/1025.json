A year ago, this figure was just 17%.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/share-of-busd-trading-on-binance\/embed\" title=\"Share of BUSD Trading on Binance\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","BUSD is the main stablecoin on the BNB Chain, a set of two blockchains associated with Binance. It's pegged to the price of the U.S. dollar, unlike the chain's native token BNB, which is free floating.","Thanks to Binance's promotion, the stablecoin now represents a significant force in the trading landscape. While trading in tether (USDT) is still dominant across all exchanges, its share of trading fell to 58% in September while BUSD's climbed to 24%.","At the same time, trading against stablecoins has continued to become more common. While in 2018, trading with bitcoin pairs made up as much as 35% of volume across exchanges, it now represents less than 3%. Similarly, trading against ether makes up less than 1% of such volume.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/share-of-trade-volume-by-pair-denomination\/embed\" title=\"Share of Trade Volume by Pair Denomination\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","The rise in trading of BUSD can be partly attributed to Binance's no-fee trading on BUSD trading pairs, which provided an incentive for traders to trade against it.

While the stablecoins USDC and USDT have seen their supplies decrease during this year, the supply of BUSD has been steadily growing. Its supply has risen from 14.4 billion at the start of the year to 21.4 billion currently. Despite this, it remains in third place with just half of USDC's supply and only a third of USDT's.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/share-of-total-stablecoin-supply\/embed\" title=\"Share of Total Stablecoin Supply\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
