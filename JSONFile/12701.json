The virtual machine allows developers to deploy smart contracts on the layer-2 solution as they appear on Layer1, with the same tooling and smart contract languages like Solidity.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The OVM was built as an L2-compatible virtual machine inside of the EVM. As such, OVM can run a fully virtualized EVM environment inside of the actual EVM and hence give developers a similar experience as interacting with the EVM.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMany layer 2 solutions, including ones that we ourselves have developed in the past, struggled with developer experience issues due to custom, non-standard tooling that presented massive learning curves\u2026 Our goal with the OVM is to make the developer experience completely unimpressive, and nearly invisible,\u201D the startup said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/optimistic-rollup-explained-44740\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Optimistic Rollup<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, transactions are executed entirely off the Ethereum base chain. Operators receive all submitted transactions, execute them, and publish the latest state to OVM, with the state root subsequently being posted to the base chain. Since the Optimistic Rollup scheme assumes all transactions to be valid, a fraud-proof step may be conducted on the Ethereum Layer1 chain to challenge certain transactions that may be invalid.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Formally known as the Plasma Group, Optimism closed the non-profit organization in January after<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/53017\/plasma-group-researchers-raise-3-5m-from-paradigm-and-ideo-to-start-new-company\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raising a $3.5 million seed round<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> from Paradigm and IDEO CoLab Ventures.

The alpha release of OVM is the first step towards that direction.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe OVM is arguably the most difficult part of building a fully EVM compatible, generalized smart contract scaling solution.

However, since the alpha version is only a sandboxed environment for developers to test their contract deployment and migration, Optimism will not enable deposits and withdrawal via OVM until later.&nbsp; <\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
