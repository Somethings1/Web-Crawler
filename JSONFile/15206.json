The ADA token has soared 1,583% this year, versus 69% for bitcoin and 417% for ether.","Cardano is considered one of the so-called \u201CEthereum-killers\u201D \u2013 fast, programmable blockchains that might eventually unseat Ethereum as the leader in decentralized finance (DeFi) as well as in other use cases like non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. Tokens from a group of Ethereum competitors, which includes the Polkadot, Solana and Terra platforms, saw triple-digit price gains last month as Ethereum looks to resolve issues with congestion and high fees on its network.","Read More: Solana\u2019s SOL Token Nearly Tripled in August as Investors Bet on \u2018Ethereum Killers\u2019","Testnet deployments and network upgrades known as \u201Cforks\u201D are widely viewed as significant milestones for a cryptocurrency\u2019s development, as nascent blockchain projects slowly mature and add new features.","According to an informational video from IOHK, the recent upgrade will aim to test stability and security and ensure that the foundational code used to write smart contracts is working properly.","The Cardano network is in the third phase of its five-era road map. The current \u201CGoguen\u201D era aims to add smart contract functionality to Cardano, giving developers the ability to build decentralized applications on the blockchain.","In the Cardano ecosystem, Alonzo is one of the sub-phases of the Goguen era, which is further split into the the three Blue, White and Purple phases. Cardano\u2019s smart contract language is called Plutus.","Cardano is eyeing Sunday, Sept. 12, as the switch date to its mainnet, giving developers just under two weeks in the current test environment.","A spokesperson for Cardano did not immediately respond to a request for comment."],"entity":[{"type":"7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1,583%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sunday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$93.7 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"417%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$2.94","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$439 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$934 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"69%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sept. 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Solana\u2019s SOL Token Nearly Tripled","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ADA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Goguen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$3.09","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Charles Hoskinson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Markets","Cardano","Ethereum","Staking"],"authors":["Tracy Wang"]}
