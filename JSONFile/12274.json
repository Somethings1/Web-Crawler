The firm is headquartered in New York and has R&amp;D offices in Tel-Aviv, Israel.","Curv provides custody solutions that utilize multi-party computation (MPC) cryptography technology. Providers of MPC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/63568\/fidelity-backed-crypto-security-startup-fireblocks-crosses-30-billion-in-digital-asset-transfers-expands-in-asia\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">claim<\/a> that it is better than multi-signature technology since it generates random key shares instead of a fixed private key. These key shares are then stored and computed separately to derive an output that can authorize a transaction collectively. In a multi-signature approach, on the other hand, distinct signatures are generated by different private keys to secure crypto assets.","Curv says its MPC technology has helped clients save a combined 60-70% in transaction fees when they shifted from more expensive multi-signature technology. This is because MPC reduces unnecessary network fees and hidden gas costs, said the firm.","Curv's major clients include Franklin Templeton, eToro, and crypto trading and lending platform Genesis, among other \"dozens of customers\" across crypto and traditional finance world.","The firm has today also made its \"tX\" initiative public -- it's a group of cryptographers and engineers who use Curv's technology to develop custody solutions. Schwartz told The Block that tX was launched several months ago and has released several models for both crypto-native and traditional financial institutions. \"These flexible models help institutions address and adapt to changing regulatory requirements faced across diverse geographies,\" said Schwartz.","Today's Series A brings Curv's total funding to date to $29.5 million.
