So I\u2019m free to say that, based on his most recent public statements, Sam Bankman-Fried seems to be losing his mind.","This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","I make this claim not as a professional psychologist but as a professional reader and writer and financial de-mystifier. Bankman-Fried\u2019s latest effort at public self-exoneration, the first blog post for his newly created Substack, will strike the informed reader as the fizzling, semi-coherent ejection of a mind trapped in a closed and degrading orbit around itself.","Despite what financier Bill Ackman seems to think for some cockeyed reason, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lie-packed and subtly unhinged disquisition is not worth your time to read, except as a set of symptoms manifesting from a psyche teetering along the event horizon of a black hole.","So I read it for you.","Bankman-Fried\u2019s \u201CFTX Pre-Mortem Overview\u201D repeats the same ham-fisted evasions and outright lies that marked his pre-arrest public apology tour. The repetition yet again of these claims and evasions, so manifestly divorced from clear public knowledge, is a strong enough sign of some manic decoupling. But the writing itself, with its wandering need and scattered malapropisms, also hints at something beneath the surface.","See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Blogs Like a Crypto Robin Hood, but inn Court He\u2019s Less Charitable","Above all, Bankman-Fried\u2019s version of events, seemingly unchanged since before his arrest, is premised on one key omission. This glaring blind spot is obvious to those living in reality but seems completely invisible to him: the corrupt nature of the relationship between Alameda Research and FTX.","The new post maintains Bankman-Fried\u2019s unwavering focus on the meltdown of Alameda Research, the supposedly unrelated hedge fund that he founded before FTX, as the determining factor in the entire affair. Bankman-Fried describes in great detail the decline in Alameda\u2019s balance sheet amid the crypto market crash of 2022, and claims that Alameda\u2019s failure \u201Cto sufficiently hedge against the risk of an extreme market crash\u201D was fundamental to his downfall.","This leaves out at least three simple and crucial facts that enabled the FTX fraud.","First, Bankman-Fried still acts as if Alameda was an entirely separate operation guided by decisions that remain some sort of vague mystery to him. But the apparent reality, already reported to law enforcement by former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, is that Bankman-Fried continued to have direct and overriding control of Alameda\u2019s operations after formally stepping down as CEO in 2019.","Second, Bankman-Fried omits that Alameda had a \u201Csecret exemption\u201D from margin collateral and liquidation requirements on FTX. This was a likely criminally fraudulent insider arrangement, and effectively gave Alameda\u2019s operators free rein to dip into FTX spot market user funds \u2013 funds that FTX explicitly promised users never to lend out in any form \u2013 to continue their losing trades.","Finally, Bankman-Fried omits that FTX never took proper custody of customers\u2019 fiat deposits, instead leaving $8 billion of free, unaccounted money in the infamous \u201Chidden, poorly internally labeled fiat account\u201D controlled by Alameda. Bankman-Fried had previously acknowledged this move, which he characterized as an $8 billion \u201Caccident.\u201D","The same lies of omission have been repeated by Bankman-Fried so often now that they\u2019re almost boring. They certainly shouldn\u2019t be convincing to anyone paying the slightest bit of attention. That\u2019s why Bankman-Fried\u2019s apparent belief that they should be persuasive invites speculation about his state of mind \u2013 it\u2019s hard to imagine a fully sane and rational person in Bankman-Fried\u2019s position continuing to insist on this sort of alternative reality.","I\u2019ve written several times before about my diagnosis of the specific variety of Bankman-Fried\u2019s break from reality: elite delusion. Sam Bankman-Fried was born and bred in a cosseted environment that assured him he could do no wrong. (His mother, Barbara Fried, seems to literally doubt that any such thing as \u201Cwrong\u201D exists.)","Bankman-Fried likely rationalized his crimes along the way as a mix of improvisational growth-hacking and temporary shortcuts to a long-term good \u2013 one of the implicit pillars of the effective altruism he espoused, however cynically. He is now being confronted with the reality of his actions. Instead of acknowledging and processing that reality, he is escaping into a fantasy world in which all the nice things his mommy and daddy and professors and investors told him about himself are still true.","The latest post also hints, though, that not even the few people still close to him remain committed to Bankman-Fried\u2019s counterfactual belief in his own faultless goodness. The post is so poorly organized, argued and written that it doesn\u2019t even seem to have been proofread. Certainly not by his lawyers \u2013 like his frenzied media tour ahead of his arrest, the blog post was almost certainly published without or against the advice of whoever is still willing to represent him.","See also: Who Are Sam Bankman-Fried's Politically Connected 'Wealthy Co-Conspirators\u2019","It doesn\u2019t seem likely it was reviewed by Bankman-Fried\u2019s law-scholar parents, either \u2013 at one point the post misspells the name of Sullivan & Cromwell, a well-known law firm Bankman-Fried worked with for years (\u201CSullivan & Crowell\u201D). This isn\u2019t a direct index of Bankman-Fried\u2019s mental state \u2013 we all make mistakes. But that a man who faces spending literally the rest of his life in prison would dribble out such a half-baked attempt at self-exoneration, without anyone close to him being willing or able to mitigate its rangy sloppiness, implies an extreme isolation that can only divorce him further from reality.","Finally, here are a few highlights of other bits of the post that are simply false, or otherwise hint at an extreme break with reality.","See also: FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Pleads 'Not Guilty' to Fraud","There\u2019s plenty more where that came from \u2013 the entire thing is a tangled mess of self-deception, underwritten by the even deeper self-deception that anyone will take it seriously.","The only truths it conveys were already obvious: That Sam Bankman-Fried is an inveterate liar, and that he is his own most gullible mark."],"entity":[{"type":"1973","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Caroline Ellison","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Barbara Fried","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sullivan & Cromwell","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"\u201CSullivan & Crowell\u201D)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bill Ackman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alameda","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Robin Hood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"American Psychiatric Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$8 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["FTX","Sam Bankman-Fried","FTX Collapse","Alameda Research","The Node","Newsletters","Opinion"],"authors":["David Z.
