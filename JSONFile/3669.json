In 2009, due to plans to construct a new powerhouse, the commission demanded the powerhouse owner, Northwestern Corporation, to either repurpose the old building or decommission it.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to a FERC document dated Oct. 24 (see below), the Old Rainbow powerhouse completely ceased operation in 2013, although the local community is reluctant to dismantle the facility. As such, Northwestern Corporation had been in search of an alternative use for the building over the past six years, according to the document. In July this year, the company finally proposed to lease the old powerhouse to California-based firm Susteen for cryptocurrency mining, saying that the mining center \u201Cwould have minimal impact and maintain the historic character of the building.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The document stated that no structural modifications will be made to the building\u2019s existing hoist, walls, and floor.

As such, information about the company\u2019s blockchain offerings is sparse. It is also not clear what kind of cryptocurrencies will be mined and what mining power this new facility will have.<\/span>","<a title=\"View FERC Opinion on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/432628782\/FERC-Opinion#from_embed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FERC Opinion<\/a> by <a title=\"View Celiawan's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/user\/474828696\/Celiawan#from_embed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Celiawan<\/a> on Scribd","<iframe id=\"doc_76034\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"FERC Opinion\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/432628782\/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-8I0y2UN0XJPrMiXQtTwq&amp;show_recommendations=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7729220222793488\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>"],"hashtag":[]}
