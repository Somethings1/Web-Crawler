New entrants may also be reluctant to invest in a spot ether ETF if they know they are getting a worse deal, they added.","Regulatory issues and the complexity of managing ETF redemptions under the Ethereum staking exit queue system make staking ETFs more challenging to launch and operate. To exit from Ethereum\u2019s staking system, stakers must pass through two queues.","The standard exit queue limits the number of stakers allowed to exit daily. Currently, this stands at around 100,000 ETH per day or nearly $400 million at current prices. From an ETF perspective, it\u2019s possible daily outflows could be more than this alone in certain economic conditions, the analysts said, citing Grayscale\u2019s GBTC outflows.","While the wait is only around 12 hours right now, in periods of market volatility this could become much longer \u2014 potentially months \u2014 hence the challenge for prospective Ethereum staking ETFs, they noted. The second queue, the validator sweeping delay, applies an additional random wait, currently nine days, they added \u2014 much longer than the redemption process for a normal ETF of one to two days.","Similarly, Ethereum\u2019s staking entry queues may also cause a delay, though only temporarily reduce the yield. However, if staking directly or purchasing liquid staking tokens like stETH is not possible for some institutional investors, how significant the yield is remains uncertain, the analysts noted.","There are ways around the problem, according to BitMEX Research, such as staking only part of the holdings and leaving the rest available for redemptions. Indeed, this is a strategy already employed by Ethereum staking exchange-traded products in Europe, with a benchmark of around 50% of assets utilized for staking. However, this reduces yields, of course.","Ark Invest\/21Shares and CoinShares currently offer such Ethereum staking ETPs in Europe. Institutional staking services provider Figment Europe and Apex Group are also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/280859\/figment-apex-group-issuance-swiss-ethereum-solana-staking-etp\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">set to launch<\/a> one on the SIX Swiss Exchange next week via Issuance.Swiss AG.","Alternatively, issuers could avoid Ethereum staking ETPs altogether and issue a stETH ETF instead, transferring the redemption issue to liquid staking platform Lido instead, the analysts suggested.","However, with the Securities and Exchange Commission \u201Ckeen to put every possible obstacle in the way of the ETF providers,\u201D issuers are \u201Cdesperate to get the products over the line,\u201D they added, meaning staking yield inclusion may be a step too far at this stage.","\u201CThis staking ETF problem is probably actually pretty positive for Ethereum from a security and decentralization perspective,\u201D the analysts said. \u201CThe last thing Ethereum needs is for BlackRock to be the largest validator. This would potentially be much worse for Ethereum, than if BlackRock became the largest bitcoin holder, since bitcoin holders have no role in block production or selecting between competing valid chains.\u201D","With the spot bitcoin ETFs launching successfully in January, attention has turned toward another narrative for crypto markets \u2014 the prospect of a spot ether ETF in the U.S. Big-name firms, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263626\/fidelity-files-for-spot-ethereum-etf-says-approval-would-be-major-win-for-us-investors\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fidelity<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263299\/blackrock-ethereum-etf-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlackRock<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/277223\/franklin-templeton-takes-initial-step-for-spot-ethereum-etf-with-new-sec-filing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Franklin Templeton<\/a> have applied for a spot ether ETF over the last few months.","Growing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/271874\/ethereum-etf-approval-may-ether-price-surge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">speculation<\/a> over the potential approval of such products has seen the price of ether outperform that of bitcoin in 2024.

In our view, it looks like an Ethereum ETF is inevitable at some point, it is just a matter of timing.\u201D","In January, SEC Chair Gary Gensler <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/274333\/gensler-says-secs-move-to-approve-spot-bitcoin-etfs-was-limited-despite-excitement-about-possible-ethereum-etfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> that the agency\u2019s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs was limited to the single cryptocurrency and \u201Cshouldn\u2019t be read to be anything more than that.\u201D Further uncertainties remain surrounding spot ether ETF approvals, given Gensler's stance that cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin are securities.","\u201CSome argue that since Ethereum staking generates a yield or because stakers propose blocks, this makes Ethereum a 'security' and therefore this provides a rationale for the SEC to reject Ethereum ETFs,\u201D BitMEX Research said.","Ultimately, the analysts argued ETF approval was a less critical factor for Ethereum than Bitcoin as the bitcoin ETFs are already first out of the gate, Ethereum culture is more aligned with technology than investing, and the staking issue makes ether ETFs less attractive."],"hashtag":["ETHEREUM","INVESTMENT FIRMS","SPOT ETHEREUM ETF"]}
