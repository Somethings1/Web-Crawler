He secured his Aave loan with an astonishing 277 million CRV tokens, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/curve-dao-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">accounts<\/a> for 32% of the total circulating supply of CRV.","According to DeBank\u2019s data, Egorov\u2019s initial loan from Aave was <a href=\"https:\/\/debank.com\/profile\/0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">substantial<\/a>&nbsp;\u2014 over $64 million in stablecoins. To collateralize this loan, he supplied nearly one-third of the total circulating supply of CRV tokens, which indicates the significant role that large token holders play in the DeFi landscape.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The price of CRV has declined by 21.71% on crypto exchange Bitstamp over the past week.

This is a crucial development, as a health rate of one usually triggers liquidation. Currently, the health rate of Egorov\u2019s position stands at a safer 1.7.","Given the volume of Egorov's CRV collateral, a mass liquidation could cause significant market disruption by precipitously dropping the token's price.&nbsp;Automated liquidations are an inherent feature of the DeFi landscape. They can trigger a cascade effect, causing the price of the collateralized asset to plummet until the market stabilizes.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
