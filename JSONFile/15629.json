The yield is created from a tokenized \u201Ccash and carry\u201D trade that involves purchasing an asset whilst simultaneously shorting that asset to rake in funding payments.","Funding is a way of keeping the asset prices on derivatives exchanges close to the underlying assets. In a bullish market, holders of long positions pay short positions and vice versa in a bearish market.","CryptoQuant warns that when funding rates become negative for a prolonged period of time, Ethena\u2019s short positions will be required to make substantial payments to those holding longs.","Ethena has allocated capital to a reserve fund for this purpose, but that fund will have to grow significantly if the market cap of USDe continues to increase.","Using examples of ether (ETH) funding rates following the Merge upgrade and the FTX collapse, a CryptoQuant report suggests that the current reserve fund of $32.7 million would only be able to sustain funding payments if USDe\u2019s market cap were below $4 billion and $3 billion respectively. The market cap of USDe has risen to $2.3 billion two months after being issued.","The report adds that Ethena\u2019s keep rate, which is the portion of revenue that gets allocated to the reserve fund, would need to remain above a certain level depending on funding rates in order to be sustainable.","\u201CIn order for Ethena to withstand a bear market period,\u201D the report said. \u201CIt would need to sustain a keep rate above 32%. This would allow the reserve fund to be large enough to resist a period of extremely negative funding rates during a bear market,\u201D the report added.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"17.2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$2.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ethena","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"32%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$32.7 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethena","Stablecoin","Derivatives"],"authors":["Oliver Knight"]}
