Through a partnership with Onramp Invest, the index can be offered by financial advisors via separately managed accounts (SMAs).&nbsp;","\"The US regulators still can't get their heads wrapped around a bitcoin spot ETF, which we think is the best structure for a 100 percent allocation,\" noted WisdomTree's Jeremy Schwartz, who added:","\"<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I know Michael's had a similar journey to try and figure out how do they get access in those structures. But today, direct access to us is really the best way to get diversified exposure... you need a tech platform to help enable that.\u201D<\/span>","In Batnick's view, the crypto market hasn't done a good job marketing itself to advisors.&nbsp;","\"<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I think that for financial advisers who spend 95 percent of their day working with families and talking about real-life problems, they only have so many hours in the day to dedicate themselves to learning about new ideas,\" Batnick said. \"And so if they were to wade into crypto, what's the first thing that they find? It's the loudest, most obnoxious promoters. And it's not very welcoming.\"<\/span>","A <a href=\"https:\/\/static.bitwiseinvestments.com\/Research\/Bitwise-ETF-Trends-2022-Benchmark-Survey.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a> released earlier this year by asset management firm Bitwise suggests that 16% of financial advisors have allocated to crypto in their clients' accounts \u2014 an increase from 9% in 2021.&nbsp;","Batnick suspects that number might be far lower.&nbsp;","\"An informal survey, I'd say we're under 1 percent,\" he contended. \"The reason why is because I think that the products that were available to financial advisers have not been suitable or at least had difficulties getting advisers comfortable wrapping their arms around the solution.\"","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this episode, Chaparro, Batnick and Schwartz also discuss:<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
