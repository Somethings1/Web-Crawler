It is designed to offer Toncoin users a voluntary tool that scans the palm of a user\u2019s hand to verify their human identity on the blockchain while preserving their physical anonymity.","Announced earlier today at the Hong Kong Web3 Festival, the program aims to enable digital identity for 500 million Telegram users within five years. Telegram initially developed the Telegram Open Network, as it was then known, raising $1.7 billion in a private sale the same year before abandoning the project following SEC investigations. In 2022, open-source developers saved and rebranded the blockchain as The Open Network with a functional mainnet.","\u201CSupporting Proof of Personhood protocols like Humancode is a step towards a practical reputation system that has real-life use cases for everyone entering our ecosystem,\u201D TON Foundation Director of Growth Ekin Tuna said in a statement shared with The Block. \u201CA scalable, private, and decentralized identity will help to onboard the first one billion users to the Web3 ecosystem in Telegram. We look forward to going further and seeing what exciting use cases it will unlock for the community and TON developers alike.\u201D","The HumanCode incentives will be distributed to TON Society members who complete the palm scan and prove their personhood. Beyond the incentives, the idea is to create a new tool for combatting on-chain bots while offering users control over their online identity. The palm-scanning technology is available via any smartphone and can prove the user is human within a few seconds, the entities claim.","\u201CWe have reached a stage where bots present a significant risk to the Web,\u201D HumanCode founder Dr Zhang said. \u201CWhilst other proof-of-human solutions exist, HumanCode\u2019s palm system offers greater user privacy protection and does not require specific hardware. With over 900 million monthly active users, we strongly believe Telegram is the tool to deliver Web3 mass adoption, and we are excited for HumanCode to support the TON community.\u201D","Worldcoin\u2019s proof-of-personhood project has run into a series of regulatory troubles over the past year, with Portugal\u2019s data regulator being the latest to order Worldcoin to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284719\/worldcoin-data-collection-portugal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">halt<\/a> its collection of personal data following a similar ban in Spain.","However, Worldcoin also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284123\/worldcoin-to-end-storing-users-personal-data\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">introduced<\/a> \u201CPersonal Custody\u201D last month, eliminating the option for the crypto project to store biometric data, which now will solely be held on users' own devices for greater control and privacy.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
