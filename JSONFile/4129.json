Total cryptocurrency market capitalization soared past $2 trillion as of August 2021, driven in part by companies and investment firms exploring the space.

It\u2019s a new investment that\u2019s built to help institutions allocate into crypto lending markets without the uncertainty and opacity. It\u2019s a fixed-term investment issued within a clear regulatory framework, and it offers returns that are much higher than what\u2019s available from banks and many fixed income markets, with terms from one month up to a year.*&nbsp; It\u2019s also fully secured and overcollateralized with Bitcoin, with all collateral held by a third-party custodian that serves more than 400 institutional clients.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>_____________________________________","¹<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/10_year_treasury_rate\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/10_year_treasury_rate <\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>²<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/moodys_seasoned_aaa_corporate_bond_yield\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">https:\/\/ycharts.com\/indicators\/moodys_seasoned_aaa_corporate_bond_yield<\/a><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Circle Yield is built with USDC, a full-reserve dollar digital currency. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">USDC is fully backed by cash and equivalents and short-duration U.S. Treasuries, so that it is always redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars.
