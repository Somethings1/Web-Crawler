This action caused the sPMM algorithm to incorrectly value the project's native token WOO at near-zero prices.","The exploiter then capitalized on this abnormal pricing to swap out 10 million WOO at minimal costs, repeating this process three times in a short span, netting themselves substantial illicit gains.","The anomaly was promptly detected by WOOFi\u2019s transaction monitoring system and other security teams active in crypto, leading to the suspension of WOOFi Swap\u2019s smart contracts by about 11 am ET to prevent further losses and initiate an investigation.","WOOFi\u2019s sPMM algorithm simulates the dynamics of centralized exchanges to offer users optimal pricing. However, an unexpected error in the algorithm\u2019s interaction with WOO\u2019s liquidity conditions on Arbitrum enabled this exploit, according to the the team.","Other WOOFi products such as WOOFi Stake, Earn, and Pro, remain unaffected and operational.","In response to the incident, WOOFi offered the attacker a 10% white hat bounty for the return of the stolen funds. The team stressed it will address the vulnerabilities before redeploying the WOOFi Swap contracts.","\"We will work with top security firms to ensure these vulnerabilities are identified at an earlier stage. This is the first time an incident like this has happened to us, and we want to make sure it doesn't happen again,\" it noted.","The price of each WOO token across various exchanges dropped by 18% after the incident, falling from $0.59 to $0.49. It has now rebounded to above $0.54, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248459\/woo-network-woo-usd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's price page<\/a>.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
