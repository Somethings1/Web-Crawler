The company is focusing on building partnerships in the music industry and hopes to bridge artists like Alesso, Doja Cat, John Legend and others with their fans by producing NFTs with a lower minting cost.","\"We can offer artists like Alesso a great blank canvas to bring their vision to life without considering how much they have to charge [fans].\u201D Said Dai. OneOf further aims to differentiate their business by connecting their NFT tokens to entries for prizes centered on real fan experiences, such as access to special Discord channels or backstage passes at concerts.","Alesso and Dai announced on The Scoop that the Cosmic Genesis NFT will come in four \"chapters\" with chances to win such tiered prizes, culminating in a one-of-one NFT auction with a ticket for a potential trip to space.","Alesso will debut new music attached to the Cosmic Genesis NFT at the Dreamverse launch event at New York's Terminal 5 concert hall on November 4th to coincide with the NFT's launch.","© 2023 The Block.
