The court order placed 3AC into liquidation on June 27, they said. 3AC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Block.&nbsp;","As a liquidation handler, Teneo\u2019s main job is to protect the assets of 3AC and understand who its creditors are, according to the person.&nbsp;Teneo is essentially representing creditors. The person declined to comment on who those creditors are and how specifically the court issued an order.","Troubles for 3AC started last month after the implosion of Terra\u2019s ecosystem and it native luna token, which sank to almost zero.

Earlier this month, they told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that the company is considering selling off assets and seeking a possible bailout. Singapore-based law firm Solitaire LLP represents 3AC, per the WSJ report.","3AC operated out of Singapore until last year, when it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/battered-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-considers-asset-sales-bailout-11655469932\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/battered-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-considers-asset-sales-bailout-11655469932&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1656583867117000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1EHVUD0r8RkTk04Tr4-20q\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reportedly relocated<\/a> to the British Virgin Islands.","The person clarified that Teneo will not manage the \u201Cinsolvency\u201D of 3AC, as reported by <a href=\"https:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-plunges-into-liquidation-12642402\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sky News<\/a> earlier today.
