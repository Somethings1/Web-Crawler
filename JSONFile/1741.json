The investment options include four portfolios, which are modelled on exchange traded funds, according to Proudman.","The portfolios include the Universe portfolio with exposure to BTC, ETH and LINK; the Sustainable portfolio includes ETH, MATIC, XTZ and SOL; a DeFi portfolio including AAVE, UNI and COMP; and finally the metaverse portfolio which has exposure to SAND and MANA.","These are examples of cryptocurrencies in the portfolios and are not an exhaustive list of the tokens available in each portfolio, the company said. Users can also customize portfolios by choosing to remove certain tokens before investing, Proudman added.&nbsp;","Users own the cryptocurrencies in the portfolios they invest in and Gemini handles the custody.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
