The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency fell 16% in April, in the biggest monthly decline since June 2022.","\u201CWhat leaves us optimistic in this pullback is that BTC\u2019s maximum drawdown from peak is at 23%, below its historical range,\u201D analysts David Han and David Duong wrote.","\u201CWe believe that this trend of overall reduced drawdowns will persist, in part because of the legitimization of BTC as a macro asset,\u201D the authors wrote. This has been reinforced by spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., Canada and Europe and also by the recently launched ETFs in Hong Kong and new applications in Australia.","While inflows of overseas ETFs may not be as large as those seen in the U.S., \u201Cwe think they represent an important signal for regulatory engagement with the asset class globally,\u201D the report said.","Blackrock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF, ended its 70-day inflow streak on Wednesday and saw its first-ever outflow, the report noted. \u201CWhile this indicates a slowdown of capital inflows to the asset class via the ETF product, we think that ETF flows only drive a portion of BTC price discovery given the global and deeply liquid markets on centralized exchanges (CEXs).\u201D","\u201CThe average weekday spot volume on CEXs during 1Q24 was $18.8 billion, more than eight-fold the $2.3 billion daily volume of U.S. spot ETFs over the same period,\u201D the note said. \u201CThis discrepancy in activity leads us to believe that bitcoin\u2019s price discovery still remains rooted in global demand trends.\u201D","The problem with looking at U.S. ETF inflows as a proxy for global price discovery is most obvious with gold, Coinbase said. The largest gold ETF in the U.S., SPDR Gold Shares, has had a net outflow of $3 billion in 2024 even as the precious metal has risen 12% year-to-date.","Read more: Crypto Market Sell-Off Was Driven by Retail Investors, JPMorgan Says"],"entity":[{"type":"June 2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Crypto Market Sell","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"David Han","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$2.3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"David Duong","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$3 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"SPDR","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"mid-April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"23%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$18.8 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Australia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin","Gold","Markets"],"authors":["Will Canny"]}
