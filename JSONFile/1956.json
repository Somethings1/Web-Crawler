January this year hit an all-time high in terms of sales on marketplaces. With the drop in the price of Ethereum and the onset of the bear market, sales have declined in terms of both number of transactions and sales volume.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/nft-marketplace-monthly-volume\/embed\" title=\"NFT Marketplace Monthly Volume\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","But there are some upsides. NFTs have gained a wider audience through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/191984\/reddit-digital-collectible-minting-hits-all-time-high\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rollout of collectible avatars<\/a> by social media site Reddit \u2014 though the company has stopped short of calling the collectibles NFTs.","And some people were still willing to fork out millions for on-chain jpegs for blue-chip collections, particularly rare NFTs from the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks collections.","Here are the biggest NFT sales on Ethereum this year:","","","NFT service MoonPay bought this ape in February for 569 ETH, then just under $1.6 million.

However, the NFT has never been sold on and remains in the company's possession.","","","In April, this CryptoPunk was purchased for 450 ETH, then $1.6m. The current owner, SpyKid.eth, owns ten Punks, with a current combined value of 1,409 ETH ($1.7 million).&nbsp;","","","Otherdeed #59906 is considered one of the rarest land plots in Yuga Lab\u2019s upcoming Otherside metaverse.","It sold in May for $1.57 million via NFT marketplace X2Y2 to n0b0dy.eth. The seller, brickandmorty.eth, spent around $6,000 to mint the NFT, netting a tidy profit.","Otherdeeds were minted on Apr. 30. The resulting rush to grab one caused gas prices to soar on Ethereum. There\u2019s a total of 200,000 out there, half of which have been earmarked for people who contribute to the development of Otherside.","At today\u2019s prices, the 625 ETH paid for it is worth $757,000.","","","On July 12, CryptoPunk #4464 sold for 2,500 ETH, just over $2.6 million at the time. The NFT was one of 24 ape-style NFTs in the entire 10,000-strong collection.","The account that bought it holds a total of 22 Punks.","","","This CryptoPunk is another one of MoonPay's purchases.

It sold in February for a cool $5.3 million, or 10,854,000 GALA.","The gaming NFT is one of over 8,000 NFTs in the collection that can be used to play and earn rewards.","","","In January, this mega mutant serum sold for 1542.069 ETH ($5.9 million).","The NFT was part of a collection rolled out by Yuga Labs last year. It airdropped 10,000 mutant serums to Bored Ape holders to be used to create Mutant Ape Yacht Club versions of their NFTs.","Once used, holders get a new mutant-inspired NFT based on their original ape without affecting the original NFT.

CEO of Chain, Deepak Thapliyal bought the NFT for 8,000 ETH (then $23.7 million) in February.","It later became one of the NFTs turned into a pendant by Tiffany\u2019s.&nbsp;","","","At the top of the list comes another NFT which, like the Ukraine flag, is supporting a cause. This time it\u2019s that of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who is currently imprisoned in the UK facing extradition to the U.S. If he loses his battle against the extradition, he faces up to 175 years in jail.","A collaboration between Assange and NFT artist Pak, Clock was bought by AssangeDAO, a group fighting for Assange\u2019s freedom. They crowdfunded $52.7 million in donations to make the winning bid of 16,953 ETH.","The NFT is a timer that counts the number of days Assange has spent in prison."],"hashtag":["BAYC","CRYPTOPUNKS","MAYC","NFT ARTISTS","YUGA LABS"]}
