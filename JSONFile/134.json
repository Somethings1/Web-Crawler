Withdrawing a token from exchanges is a highly unusual step, although controlling liquidity in this way can limit the ability of short sellers to bet against tron. It also ensures the Tron DAO can maintain a large reserve of tron, with which to redeem USDD holders looking to sell.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whenever USDD drops below its dollar peg it puts inflationary pressure on tron as more tokens are created to defend the peg. On Monday, the funding rate for shorting tron on Binance had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/151558\/tron-deploys-2-billion-from-reserves-to-guard-against-shorts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crossed 500%,<\/a> suggesting huge demand for the trade.<\/span>","Tron traded at about $0.06 as of the time of writing, up 6% over the past 24 hours \u2013 but still 25% lower than its price a week ago.","Â© 2023 The Block.
