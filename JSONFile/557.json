Expectations for smart contracts to meet so-called harmonized standards, or technical compliance specifications, were also dropped.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The text also reduces the scope to only cover \u201Cthe contractual party offering a smart contract,\u201D instead of a broader group covering vendors or professionals involved in the deployment of smart contracts.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The EU plans to regulate smart contacts under its broader strategy on data markets.

Then it will need to go through a plenary vote in Parliament, currently expected in March. If passed, the file would then move forward to inter-institutional negotiations together with the European Commission and European Council.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
