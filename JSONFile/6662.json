This process is what facilitates the buying and selling of crypto tokens on exchanges.","FTX\u2019s matching engine has long been the subject of complaints from users. These complaints have been about the high latency and low throughput of the platform\u2019s matching engine. Latency in the context refers to how fast the matching engine can match the buy and sell orders of users. Higher latency means slower trade execution which can be detrimental for users as profitable trading positions can be lost due to high latency.","According to Bankman-Fried, these improvements will double FTX\u2019s order throughput while reducing the latency by 50%. He stated that these upgrades have been in the works for most of the year and are almost ready for release on the platform.","FTX <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/169726\/sbf-apologizes-for-ftx-glitches-amid-high-volatility\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suffered a downtime<\/a> last month due to what Bankman-Fried described as web interface-related issues. The glitch prevented users from accessing the crypto exchange\u2019s website in the immediate aftermath of the September U.S. consumer price index report going live.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
