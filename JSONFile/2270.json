Funding in dollar amount has now declined for two consecutive quarters as web3 asset prices have slumped.","Moy also predicted there will be \"more discipline\" around building products and finding out how to monetize them.","\"With the excitement, and the FOMO and frothiness, everyone just has to get back to really hyper-focus on the basics to survive,\" Moy said.

You should try to extend your runway as much as you possibly can.\""],"hashtag":[]}
