NFT communities like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/143328\/bored-ape-instagram-account-hacked-nfts-worth-2-8-million-stolen\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suffered several instances<\/a> of their holders losing valuable NFTs to scammers via social engineering attacks.","The feature works by telling users the details of the transactions they are signing in a way that is easy to understand. ClearSign will also act as a firewall that blocks unwanted actions from untrustworthy decentralized Dapps, according to ZenGo\u2019s announcement.&nbsp;","The firewall will alert users to suspicious smart contracts and block the signing of transactions that would expose private keys or seed phrases.","ZenGo says it has already partnered with the popular Discord bot Collab.Land to integrate ClearSign on the latter\u2019s platform. Many projects use Collab.Land to verify that their members are owners of their digital assets, including NFTs. Some high-profile NFT hacks have involved the creation of fake Collab.Land bots to steal valuable collectibles from unsuspecting victims.","ClearSign will be available on both iOS and Android. ZenGo says it will add other Dapp integrations in the coming weeks.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
