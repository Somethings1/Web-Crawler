The precedent may open the door to future actions against DAOs and decentralized exchanges in the near future.","\u201CThe founders created the Ooki DAO with an evasive purpose, and with the explicit goal of operating an illegal trading platform without legal accountability,\u201D said CFTC Division of Enforcement Director Ian McGinley in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cftc.gov\/PressRoom\/PressReleases\/8715-23\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">release<\/a>. \u201CThis decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure, intending to insulate themselves from law enforcement and ultimately putting the public at risk.\u201D","Multiple amicus briefs filed on Ooki's behalf argued that DAOs should not be treated as a singular entity and that the government should have to individually identify and summon each member of the DAO before the case could proceed.","The CFTC issued an enforcement action against the decentralized trading platform last September to stop Ooki from allowing retail commodity trading of digital tokens without registering with the CFTC. Ooki DAO, which established the exchange, did not respond in court after multiple summons were issued to them electronically. The court found Ooki civilly liable for operating an illegal trading platform and unlawfully acting as a futures commission merchant.","As a result of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cftc.gov\/media\/8741\/enfookidaojudgment060923\/download\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">default judgement<\/a>, the exchange has been ordered to cease doing business in the U.S. and prohibited from doing business with any entity registered with the CFTC, which could include non-U.S. companies.
