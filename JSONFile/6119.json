It could also facilitate the creation of insurance protocols that use historical on-chain activities for determining payouts or offering coverage, it added.","The release of this on-chain accumulator tool was one of the major highlights at yesterday's Starknet Summit in San Francisco.","The accumulator tool utilizes the Stark prover \u2014 co-developed by Eli Ben-Sasson, President of StarkWare. More specifically, Herodotus employed a custom version of StarkWare\u2019s shared prover (SHARP).","<a href=\"https:\/\/book.starknet.io\/chapter_8\/storage_proofs.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Storage proofs<\/a> are cryptographic methods used to confirm the validity of data, transactions, or assets on a blockchain without requiring a third party.
