Still, the cryptocurrency fell over 16% last month.","\u201CNew capital inflows will not move the market or the marginal buyer or seller as much,\u201D the report added.","Read more: Bitcoin Could Drop Further to as Low as $50K, Standard Chartered Says","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin Could Drop Further","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Standard Chartered Says","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"October 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"last two years","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Zack Wainwright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"1970s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Wainwright","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"S&P","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Fidelity Digital Assets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"16%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$50K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Netflix (NFLX","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Volatility","Bitcoin"],"authors":["Will Canny"]}
