U.S. bank regulators issued multiple warnings about exposure to digital assets in the lead up to Silvergate\u2019s troubles and demise, though a massive run on deposits fueled by a capital raise and jittery startup and venture capital customers led to Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A policymaker who played a key part in the creation of the European Union\u2019s comprehensive digital asset framework acknowledged the complications that events of the past week could have on future policy for the industry.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMany banks say they will have nothing to do with crypto,\u201D said Peter Kerstens, an adviser with the European Commission. \u201CSome regulators don\u2019t want anything to do with crypto.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Because few banks are comfortable with the asset class, there\u2019s a limited number who do business with digital asset companies. That creates more risk for the crypto industry, argued Coinbase VP of Global Regulatory Policy Scott Bauguess.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CRight now there\u2019s lot of concentration of risk in the banking industry by crypto firms,\u201D due to specialization, he said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As two banks, Silvergate and New York, NY.\u2019s Signature Bank faced operational challenges, and Santa Clara, Calif.\u2019s Silicon Valley Bank failed, that meant two of the main U.S. crypto banks were no longer available, while a startup and venture capital-friendly bank failure threatened to have broader repercussions for the global tech industry, including crypto.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhat we\u2019re seeing is TradFi has infected crypto, it\u2019s been just the opposite,\u201D of concerns about crypto affecting the traditional banking sector, Bauguess argued. <\/span>","&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
