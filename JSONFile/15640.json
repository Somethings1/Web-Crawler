The Solana-based crypto staking project Jito released its JTO token, and according to CoinDesk's Danny Nelson, even small-time users were getting thousands of dollars worth. Kamino Finance, a decentralized-finance or DeFi protocol on Solana, is planning to launch a \"points program,\" which could set the stage for a future token airdrop. Seamless Protocol, a lending and borrowing protocol built atop Coinbase's layer-2 blockchain, Base, issued SEAM governance tokens, airdropped to users. As the Bankless newsletter put it, \"airdrop season is underway.\"","ALSO:","Bitkey includes a mobile app, hardware device, and a set of recovery tools, according to the company. (Block\/Business Wire)","Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.","1. Celestia, a so-called data availability (DA) solution designed to provide a cheaper alternative for verifying data generated from blockchain transactions, announced Tuesday that it will become an option for blockchain builders using Polygon's software tools to spin up new layer-2 networks atop Ethereum. The announcement generated ample chatter on the social-media site X, as well as speculation in digital-asset markets, over the prospects for \"modular\" blockchain setups.","2. Nil Foundation announced the features of its new Type-1 zkEVM powered by zkLLVM, \"making it the first zkEVM with core components built automatically, preventing insecurities that result from manual circuit definition,\" according to the team: \"Nil\u2019s zkEVM is designed to have security as a fundamental feature enabled by its proprietary zkLLVM compiler. The zkLLVM quickly and automatically compiles high-level code (C++ or Rust) into efficient zk-SNARK circuits.\"","3. Beam, an open-source blockchain specialized for gaming and run by Merit Circle DAO, will now launch on Immutable zkEVM, a groundbreaking scaling solution powered by Polygon, according to the team: \"Beam is an ecosystem and a blockchain. We want to remain chain-agnostic. Where we started as a subnet on Avalanche, we don\u2019t want to limit ourselves to the Avalanche ecosystem.","4. Decentralized exchange Uniswap, the fifth-biggest DeFi protocol, has expanded to the Bitcoin sidechain Rootstock, in a boost to the world's largest blockchain's decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Uniswap version 3 (v3) has been deployed on Rootstock by GFX Labs, the team behind trading terminal Oku, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Monday. Uniswap, originally designed for Ethereum, has also been deployed on the Ethereum layer-2 networks Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.","5. FIRST ON COINDESK: Blocknative, a blockchain infrastructure company that cut staff in October after suspending work on a major business project, released a new tool to examine the \"mempool\" of pending transactions awaiting processing on Ethereum, an effort that could ultimately help to reduce instances of block-level manipulation and protect users from front-running bots.","See the entire Protocol Village list from this past week here.","Funraisings","Deals and grants","Data and tokens","Regulatory and Policy","Loyal readers of The Protocol will recall our riff in last week's issue, headlined \"Bitcoin Censorship, or Just 'Spam Filtering?'\" The gist of the story is that some Bitcoin purists are trying to keep the oldest and largest blockchain free from non-financial transactions \u2013 such as the text snippets and images that some people are \"inscribing\" onto the blockchain via the Ordinals protocol, launched late last year. The drama ratched up recently when Ocean, a new bitcoin mining pool backed by Jack Dorsey and co-led by a longtime Bitcoin developer, the pseudonymous (and feisty) Luke Dashjr, set up software that would \"filter\" out the Ordinals inscriptions. A lot of users of the blockchain, however, say a few people shouldn't be deciding how the Bitcoin blockchain gets used; let the market decide, the thinking goes. That really amounts to a bet that Bitcoin miners, who ultimately decide which transactions to include in new data blocks and which ones to leave out, will choose to maximize self-interest, er, profits. And that makes them more likely to keep including these Bitcoin \"inscriptions\" because, you know, why leave money on the table? The chart below, courtesy of Dune Analytics, shows just how much in fees have been generated to date by inscriptions-related transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain \u2013 $147.7 million.","Fees (in dollars) paid to Bitcoin miners for Ordinals inscriptions. The green vertical lines (legend on left) show fees paid on a daily basis, while the black line (legend on right) shows cumulative fees since December 2022.
