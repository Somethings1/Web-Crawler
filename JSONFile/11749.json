Bacelar is not your typical Congressional candidate. With a degree from Stanford University and a professional background in blockchain, Bacelar is aiming to make tech regulation an important conversation in politics. In this conversation she discusses how she got into politics, her time working at Democracy Earth, her stance on universal basic income, and why now is the time to run against the most powerful Democrat in the country. I hope you enjoy the episode.","<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/playlist.megaphone.fm?e=BLOCK4285663690\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>"],"entity":[{"type":"Spotify","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Apple","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bacelar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Agatha Bacelar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nancy Pelosi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Stanford University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"House","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":[],"authors":["Frank Chaparro","The Block"]}
