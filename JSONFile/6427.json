This approach ensures that the amounts swapped or traded within users\u2019 wallets cannot be connected to their actual wallet addresses.","Inside the Elusiv app, users are required to deposit funds into a private balance before sending or swapping tokens \u2014 all without exposing their public key. The procedure includes the use of a temporary key, acting as a burner account, which disconnects the link between a user\u2019s public key and encrypts the source of the transactions.","\u201CElusiv Privacy represents the future of blockchain transactions \u2014 achieving a seamless blend of zero-knowledge privacy, efficiency, and instantaneous settlement,\u201D Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana, said in a statement shared with The Block via a representative.","Â© 2023 The Block.
