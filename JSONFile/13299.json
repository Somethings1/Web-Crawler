If successful, it could also go some way to doing what governments have been thus far unable to do: put more clear parameters around the legal status of centralized finance (DeFi) and who is culpable when something goes wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;","A named partner at the law firm Roche Freedman, Kyle Roche, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KyleWRoche\/status\/1525079906832482304\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted on May 13<\/a>: \"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If you purchased <\/span><span class=\"r-18u37iz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$LUNA<\/span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> or <\/span><span class=\"r-18u37iz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$UST<\/span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> on either <\/span><span class=\"r-18u37iz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@coinbase <\/span><span class=\"r-18u37iz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@krakenfx <\/span><span class=\"r-18u37iz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@binance <\/span>or <span class=\"r-18u37iz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@Gemini<\/span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, please reach out to <a href=\"\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"1440716666754671777b6271666d54667b777c71726671717079757a3a777b79\">[email&nbsp;protected]<\/a> .
