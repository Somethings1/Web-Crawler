That failure has only increased legal and regulatory scrutiny over the sector. The FSOC also recommended that Congress pass <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174527\/senior-u-s-regulators-propose-new-legislation-increased-rules-around-digital-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">multiple new laws<\/a> to address potential gaps in regulation of crypto companies, including \u201Cregulatory arbitrage,\u201D where firms like FTX position themselves outside traditional regulatory lanes.","Yellen echoed previous statements from banking regulators in highlighting the lack of exposure that digital assets have to the banking industry. She saw that as a positive.","\u201CThe good piece of an explosion like we saw is that it hasn\u2019t spilled over to the banking sector; banking regulators have been very careful,\u201D she said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
