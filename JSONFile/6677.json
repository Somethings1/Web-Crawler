The litigation tail that skeptics expected has started to thwack back fiercely, and this case is yet another to add to what is likely to begin a lengthy string cite for the point that calling a fig a duck won\u2019t make fruit quack and that \u201Cutility token\u201D won\u2019t magically transmute a security into something else.","This lawsuit is one of several that ensnared a celebrity, too. Here, it\u2019s the rapper T.I. At issue in this securities action (not a class action, by the way, just a pile of individual plaintiffs) is a token sale for something called FLik. The Court explains the basic facts underlying the suit thus:","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe defendants were the controlling shareholdings of FLiK, a company initiated to create an online distribution platform for entertainment projects. To raise money to launch the company and its online platform, the defendants conducted an initial coin offering (\u201CICO\u201D) from August 20, 2017 to September 20, 2017. In an ICO, a company offers purchasers a unique digital asset, often called a \u201Ccoin\u201D or \u201Ctoken,\u201D in exchange for consideration. FLiK\u2019s ICO involved the sale of a limited number of FLiK tokens, which were then available for sale on the secondary market.\u201D<\/em>","There was the usual whitepaper, claims that the token would moon and everyone would make beaucoup bucks, and \u201Cseveral announcements promoting the tokens, including social media posts describing high-value purchases, celebrity endorsements, and investments and upcoming projects that the company would take on.\u201D The tokens went up in value, then they went down, nothing got launched and (per the court\u2019s opinion) \u201Cthe tokens are now essentially worthless.\u201D Plaintiffs say they lost about $2 million and that this was really just a classic pump and dump scheme and was an unregistered securities offering. So they filed suit under the federal Securities Act and under Georgia\u2019s state securities law.","T.I. filed a motion to dismiss. He argued that the tokens were not securities and even if they are that the claims weren\u2019t adequately pleaded. The Court applied the Howey Test.","First, there was an investment of money to pay for the FLiK tokens, and for purposes of prong 1 of the Howey Test payment in digital assets suffices. Defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary was \u201Cnot persuasive.\u201D","Second, Felton challenged the third Howey element\u200A\u2014\u200A\u201Cexpectation of profits derived solely from the [managerial] efforts of others.\u201D The Court rejected this argument too. The fact that they offered some functionality didn\u2019t matter for pleading purposes: \u201CAlthough the tokens had additional functionality\u200A\u2014\u200Asuch as access to in- person FLiK events for token owners\u200A\u2014\u200Athe complaint details several ways in which Felton led the plaintiffs to believe that they could expect a profit from buying the tokens.\u201D In addition, the use of funds \u201Cwas already determined by the defendants\u201D per the FLiK token whitepaper. In short, purchase of FLiK tokens was a speculative investment in a largely non-existent technology, with the expectation of investment returns that depended entirely on the defendants' efforts.","Even though the Court agrees that these tokens were in fact sufficiently alleged to be securities, the Court granted the motion to dismiss the federal securities claims (with leave to refile) for timing reasons. Claims for unregistered sale of securities have to be brought within a year after the violation on which they are based, under federal law. Because this isn\u2019t pleaded, these claims were dismissed with leave to refile. Plaintiffs have since filed an amended complaint that seeks to fix this problem.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
