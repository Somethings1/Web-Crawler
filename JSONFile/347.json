The actual merger would occur when the second version of Yearn launches, which is currently under development. The development comes days after Pickle.Finance was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/85370\/defi-project-pickle-finance-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">exploited<\/a> for nearly $20 million worth of DAI.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAfter the Yearn's V2 release, Pickle jars and Yearn's v2 vaults would merge. Technically, Pickle jars are a fork of Yearn's yVaults. \"Pickle Jars will be deployed as Yearn vaults, using the forthcoming v2 design. A more detailed migration plan to follow,\" per the&nbsp;announcement. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nWhen the merger activates, two new tokens would also be launched \u2014 DILL and CORNICHON. Pickle tokens would need to be locked to earn DILL.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\"Locking Pickle yields DILL (Pickle tokens that are placed in time locked escrow). The longer time period the Pickle is locked for, the more DILLs are received,\" according to the announcement. \"The minimum locking period is 1 week and the maximum period is 4 years.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAs for CORNICHON, the token would be distributed to victims of the Pickle's recent attack who lost $19.7 million in DAI. \"Tokens will be minted against a snapshot of balances at the time of the attack, and distributed to victims proportionally,\" per the announcement.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nPost-merger, the total value locked (TVL) of the two protocols would also merge. The current TVL of Yearn is $433 million, according to DeFi Pulse, and Pickle's TVL is around $31 million, according to DeFi Llama.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAs part of the deal, Yearn would also onboard Pickle's developers to work on its product and share fees. Both protocols are yield optimizers and launched in 2020.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe merger news has sent the price of the Pickle token up 35% to trade at around $20, according to CoinGecko. The YFI token, on the other hand, is trading 1.5% down at about $24,675.","Developer Andre Cronje did not respond to a request for comment by press time.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
