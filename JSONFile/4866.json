This is a huge risk to the future success of the nation\u2019s financial services sector,\u201D he added. \u201CAs Britain grapples with the question of how to maintain its position as a global financial services position, post-Brexit, we must seize the opportunity that the digital revolution presents.\u201D","Hammond has just taken a position as a senior advisor at Copper, the London-based crypto custodian catering to institutional investors that closed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/108095\/alan-howard-25-million-investment-london-crypto-custodian-copper\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a $75 million Series B raise<\/a> from investors including British billionaire Alan Howard earlier this year.","The Conservative Party politician \u2014 who served as Chancellor from 2016 to 2019 \u2014 will provide strategic advice to Copper as it expands internationally, as well as promoting the U.K. as a digital assets hub.","The U.K., and London in particular, has long been viewed as an attractive location to set up and run fintech startups. Hammond\u2019s predecessor as chancellor, George Osborne, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/1f24a25e-886f-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">set up the lobby group Innovate Finance in 2015<\/a> to help boost a sector that went on to produce <a href=\"https:\/\/sifted.eu\/articles\/full-list-fintech-unicorns-europe\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">more than a dozen unicorns<\/a>, privately-held startups with billion dollar valuations.","But the impact of Brexit coupled with regulatory constraints for crypto firms \u2014 including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/90130\/crypto-derivatives-ban-comes-into-effect-uk\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">banning the sale of crypto derivatives to retail investors<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/107057\/uk-fca-new-registration-deadline-crypto-march-2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">an unwieldy anti-money laundering registration process<\/a> \u2014 has led some crypto entrepreneurs to lose faith in the U.K.","Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO of $5.2 billion crypto wallet Blockchain.com, recently said that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/119862\/blockchain-london-fintech-capital-definitely-over\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">London\u2019s reign as fintech capital is \u201Cdefinitely over.\u201D<\/a>","Hammond, however, is optimistic that a comeback could be on the cards.","\u201CThe U.K., and London specifically, has a strong track record of embracing change to financial services. It\u2019s what made the City what it is. Now we\u2019re at risk of losing that edge to jurisdictions with more proactive legislative and regulatory environments for fintech innovation,\u201D he said.&nbsp;\u201CWorking with Copper, I hope to demonstrate both domestically and abroad that London not only still has what it takes to dominate in this space, but that it is indeed setting the standard for how financial instruments could, and should, be securely transacted using DLT.\u201D","Underpinning Hammond\u2019s work at Copper is a belief in the transformative potential of the technology that powers cryptocurrencies.","\u201COur current system isn\u2019t broken, it\u2019s just massively inefficient,\u201D he said, adding that companies and their customers bear the cost of that inefficiency. Hammond believes that the benefits of blockchain technology \u2014 namely, instant settlement and an immutable public record of transactions \u2014 will pave the way for faster access to financial services and real-time regulation.","Hammond said it is \u201Ctoo early\u201D to forecast the usefulness of blockchain technology as the foundation for more recent innovations, like decentralized finance applications and non-fungible tokens. But he added that the transformative effects of \u201Cdisintermediating the lending process\u201D \u2014 cutting out intermediaries \u2014 are clear.","\u201CWhat I will also say is that it\u2019s very exciting to see that the&nbsp;innovation doesn\u2019t stop with financial services; other verticals are driving change and exploring how the speed and security of blockchain-enabled ecosystems can broaden access and promote change,\u201D Hammond added. &nbsp;&nbsp;","Lobbying work by former politicians on behalf of fintech firms has come under the microscope in the U.K. recently.","Former Prime Minister David Cameron <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-56578838\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has been heavily criticised<\/a> for his efforts to open doors for the since-collapsed supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital during the pandemic.","Hammond himself was subject to an investigation by the U.K.\u2019s lobbying watchdog over his work for the fintech firm OakNorth, but he was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/447ca818-9ac8-474d-8654-af534a3a5599\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cleared of breaking any rules<\/a>. He told the Financial Times earlier this week <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/bbf55915-8e8f-48a4-8c05-993dc388a528\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">that \u201Ceveryone has taken on board\u201D<\/a> lessons learned from the Greensill debacle.","Â© 2023 The Block.
