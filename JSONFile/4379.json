Instead, Grayscale would continue to operate GBTC without a redemption program until they successfully covert it to a spot bitcoin ETF.","Shares in GBTC cannot currently be redeemed, which forces sellers to part with their holdings at a discount. Converting GBTC into an exchange-traded fund could resolve this.","However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has thus far proven harshly critical of spot bitcoin ETFs \u2014 having rejected every application for years. Grayscale is currently involved in a lawsuit against the SEC.","As part of the lawsuit, Grayscale is currently in the process of the drafting a response to the SEC's reply brief, which is due by Jan. 13, 2023. Final written briefs are due on Feb. 3, 2023 then shortly thereafter a three judge panel will be selected to hear oral arguments and rule on the case, Sonnenshein clarified in the letter.","\"We remain steadfast in our belief that the conversion of GBTC to an ETF is in the best interest of investors, and we remain 100% committed to that endeavor,\" said Sonnenshein. \"This is and always has been the business priority for the Grayscale team.\"","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"TextRun SCXW77471392 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW77471392 BCX0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: This story has been updated with more details from Grayscale's letter to shareholders.<\/span><\/span><\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
