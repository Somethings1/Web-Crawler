But the project fell out of favor and was delisted yesterday. The value of these deposited tokens is currently worth more than $50 million, which the team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/195326\/mithril-binance-delisting-refund?utm_source=cryptopanic&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">demanded<\/a> back.","The Binance chief broke down why the exchange decided to keep Mithril\u2019s deposit. Zhao implied the team made the right decision (of not releasing the deposit), claiming it acted within its right. He <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cz_binance\/status\/1603649325300453376\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> on Twitter that since the website of the project was offline, the Mithril team violated the listing terms.","In his reply to Mithril, Zhao <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cz_binance\/status\/1603649325300453376\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>: \u201CYour token price is way below the trigger levels. Reading the comments. Your website is offline. You haven\u2019t tweeted or updated your community for almost 2 years. I believe our team has made the right decision and acted fully within our right to do so.\u201D","Zhao added the team had the right to take the deposit \u2014 made by a crypto project \u2014 in two conditions. The first is if the price of the token trades lower below a certain trigger level for more than 15 days and the second is a situation that creates a \u201Cmaterial adverse effect\u201D on the project, its token and\/or its users. The team\u2019s defunct communications were cited as the second condition.","\u201CThe Insurance Deposit is there to encourage builders to continue to build,\u201D Zhao said, further implying Mithril's team had stopped working on the project.","A Binance spokesperson said that when tokens no longer meet its standards, they go through a review process and may be delisted. \"The insurance deposit was collected as a way to monitor and incentivise project performance, which is in our users\u2019 interests. The deposit amount and terms were mutually agreed in 2018,\u201D they said.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With reporting assistance from Lucy Harley-McKeown.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
