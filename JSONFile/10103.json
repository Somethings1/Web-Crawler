That's a maximum of 675,000 ether.","Buterin currently holds about 250,000 ether, worth around $390 million at current prices, based on his publicly known addresses, said Simon Cousaert, director of data at The Block. Buterin has sent about 205,000 ether to exchanges over the years from those addresses, Cousaert added. The rest of the ether could be held in Buterin\u2019s addresses that are not publicly known or sent to other counterparties.","","","The figures above show that Buterin has sent over 30% of his ether holdings to exchanges over the years for purposes such as donations. In June, Buterin set up his own charitable entity, <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/VitalikButerin\/status\/1666860071278587927?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kanro<\/a>, aiming to fight Covid-19 and other pandemics.
