The wind-up has been delayed for months by talks over the contribution that DCG should make.","An in-principle deal announced by Genesis on Tuesday saw DCG \u2013 which is also CoinDesk\u2019s parent company \u2013 agreeing to a series of partial repayments to satisfy liabilities of $630 million in unsecured loans due in May 2023 and $1.1 billion due in 2032.","That hasn\u2019t pleased everyone.","\u201CDCG\u2019s contribution to the estate in satisfaction of creditor claims is wholly insufficient to satisfy even the uncontested loan amounts due, let alone, the valuable estate claims assertable by creditors against DCG and its directors and officers, including Barry Silbert,\u201D a group of Genesis lenders said in a filing to the Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York.","The lenders took exception to DCG and CEO Silbert being released from future legal claims, and threatened to block any final bankruptcy deal that incorporated the plans.","The filing accused Genesis and a formal committee that represents creditors of neglecting their fiduciary duty to maximize recoveries by agreeing to the DCG deal. Membership of the ad hoc lenders\u2019 grouping has not been made public, but the filing says they have a combined $2.4 billion in claims against GGC, including a majority of each class of claims asserted against it.","In the Tuesday filing that announced the deal, Genesis said it could result in recoveries of 70%-90% for unsecured creditors, and said that \u201Cconstructive discussions\u201D were ongoing with the lenders\u2019 grouping.","Neither Genesis nor DCG had responded to a CoinDesk request for comment by publication time.","Edited by Sheldon Reback."],"entity":[{"type":"a billion dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"90%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bankruptcy Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2032","content":"DATE"},{"type":"May 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"GGC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$630 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$2.4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group (DCG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Barry Silbert","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Southern District of New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Genesis","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$1.1 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Genesis","Digital Currency Group","Bankruptcy","Genesis global capital"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
