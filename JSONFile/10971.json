The amount to be issued will be determined by the RBA considering the requirements of selected use case providers, and no interest will be paid by the RBA on any holdings of eAUD.","Only Australian-registered entities and Australian resident individuals will be allowed to hold eAUD, and that holders would need to be invited to participate, approved and KYC-ed to take part.","According to a timeline included in the white paper, the pilot will be conducted with selected use cases from January-April 2023. It is currently engaging with industry participants on the design and usage of the CBDC pilot, with a deadline of Oct. 31 for expressions of interest. The selected use cases for the pilot will be announced in December, with the actual pilot running from January to April next year.
