In their letter to the judge asking for a prison sentence, prosecutors describe an outrageous scam that Fowler attempted to continue even after he knew he was under investigation.","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fowler provided crypto exchanges such as <\/span><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitfinex, Binance, CEX.io and QuadrigaCX with illegal access to U.S. banks even though Fowler did not have a banking license, prosecutors say. He was indicted in 2019 on charges of <\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmission business.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Prosecutors are also seeking <\/span><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$53 million in restitution for his role in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.si.com\/nfl\/2019\/05\/01\/alliance-american-football-aaf-collapse-charlie-ebersol-tom-dundon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bankrupting a startup football league called the Alliance of American Football<\/a>. They allege Fowler promised them a $53 million investment and a $120 million line of credit, but reneged on both promises leading to the collapse of the league.<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">They also want the forfeiture of $740 million \u2014 cash that ran through Crypto Capital on behalf of its exchange clients. In total, they\u2019re seeking $793 million from Fowler, although they\u2019re unlikely to ever see it.<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But it is Fowler\u2019s behavior while under investigation that is, perhaps, the strangest part of the case.<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2016, he was stopped at the Canadian border carrying items commonly used in a \u201Cblack money scam,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/storage.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.nysd.513750\/gov.uscourts.nysd.513750.120.0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to court filings by the prosecution<\/a>. It\u2019s not clear exactly what Fowler was intending to do, but usually a \u201Cblack money scam\u201D involves convincing a dupe to take a trove of banknotes that have apparently been stained with ink, as if they were snatched in a robbery that contained a dye pack. The promise is that if the dupe can clean the notes with a special chemical, they can share the newly washed loot. Of course, the notes are fake.<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Two years later, the FBI raided his home and found <\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$14,000 in counterfeit bills.<\/span>","After he was charged in the Crypto Capital case, Fowler presented to the court a sketchy document that purported to show he had a money transmitting license from a \u201Cfree industrial zone\u201D in the Republic of Georgia. It was dated after the time he was charged.","Worse, as his sentencing date grew closer, Fowler appears to have gone on a gambling binge, <a href=\"https:\/\/storage.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.nysd.513750\/gov.uscourts.nysd.513750.120.0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">prosecutors told the judge<\/a>:","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C<\/span><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The government has obtained records from a casino company in Arizona that indicate that during the pendency of the defendant\u2019s criminal case, he has gambled hundreds of thousands of dollars.
