This decentralized model invites community members to submit suggestions, feature enhancements, bug fixes, and updates via Lens Protocol\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/GitHub.com\/lens-protocol\/LIPs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">GitHub<\/a> repository.","In a deviation from the typical approach of decentralized autonomous organizations (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172416\/whats-next-for-daos-breaking-down-the-cftcs-latest-enforcement-action\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DAOs<\/a>), the Lens governance system evaluates a proposal's popularity based on community feedback instead of using a token-based on-chain voting system.","This method separates Lens from other Web3 projects that typically rely on DAO tokens for decision-making.","So far, three initial proposals have been introduced under the new model to be published on its GitHub repository. This repository for LIPs will also house all open standards utilized by Lens Protocol, divided into specific folders for each type of standard, such as the \"Lens' open algorithm standards.\"","\u201CLIPs will progressively move Lens towards open governance. Through the LIPs framework on Github, community members can propose improvements \u2013 from the submission of proposals to transparent discussion and, ultimately, a voting process,\u201D Stani Kulechov, CEO of Aave Companies, the core developer of Lens Protocol, told The Block. \u201CThe community will be able to have open discussions about new proposals and weigh in to provide their unique perspective on why they should be implemented.\u201D","The first proposal, LIP-0, establishes a governance model emphasizing transparency. The second proposal, LIP-1, suggests the creation of open standards for algorithms to foster user choice and enable the integration of third-party algorithms and machine learning services. The third proposal, LIP-2, would standardize metadata to improve Lens\u2019s interoperability with other projects.&nbsp;","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/133390\/aave-officially-debuts-protocol-for-decentralized-social-media-dubbed-lens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Launched on Polygon<\/a> in May 2022, Lens says it supports over 110,000 social media profiles and hundreds of applications.","Earlier this month, Lens Protocol announced a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233746\/lens-protocol-raise-decentralized-social-media\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$15 million funding round<\/a> led by IDEO CoLab Ventures.
