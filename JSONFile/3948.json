Stablecoins are used for trading on decentralized exchanges and for various purposes within DeFi protocols.","Recent significant market moves also drove USDC\u2019s growth, a Circle spokesperson told The Block.","\"As digital asset markets trend up or down, both scenarios tend to generate increased demand for USDC \u2014 especially during significant market moves,\u201D said the spokesperson.","When markets move up, increased interest from investors causes an increased demand for USDC as a way to bring fiat currency into crypto trading platforms. On the contrary, when markets go down, more traders are selling volatile assets into stablecoins like USDC, said the spokesperson.","USDT is different from its competitors \"that rely mainly on DeFi platforms to boost their supply,\" Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino told The Block. USDT's demand is mainly driven by centralized exchange users and institutions, he said.","But with the recent bearish crypto market sentiment, USDT's demand from institutions has decreased, said Ardoino, adding that demand from retail investors, however, is growing from Turkey and several countries in Latin America.","Looking at the bigger picture, USDT's total supply across blockchain continues to remain higher than that of USDC's. The former's current total supply stands at over 82 billion, and the latter's stands at around 45 billion.","USDC's supply has been consistently increasing over the past several months, whereas USDT's supply has remained somewhat stagnant.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/total-stablecoin-supply-daily\/embed\" title=\"Total Stablecoin Supply\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Ardoino said there is a \"sufficient amount\" of USDT in circulation.","Tether has been increasingly freezing funds recently.
