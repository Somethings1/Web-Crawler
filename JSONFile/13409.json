Because funds were \"locked up,\" validators were not able to use those funds for other purposes. Still, the number of validators on the Ethereum network <a href=\"https:\/\/beaconscan.com\/statistics\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">currently<\/a> is about 560,000.","Enabling withdrawals of staked ether will make it easier for individuals and groups to participate in the network. With a more clear path to withdrawal, it is likely that more people will be willing to participate as validators, thus increasing the security of the network.","Ahead of the upgrade, traders are placing their bets on the future price of Ethereum, with open interest reaching all-time highs for ether options on CME this month. The volume of completed trades for Ethereum options lagged behind, signaling that traders are accumulating contracts in anticipation of the update, betting on which direction the price will swing.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/options\/volume-and-oi-of-cme-ethereum-options\/embed\" title=\"Volume and OI of CME Ethereum options\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","\"We have seen increased buying of ETH calls this week,\" said Joe Kruy, head of institutional coverage for America's at Paradigm, a liquidity provider for crypto derivatives. \"However, I do not view most of these upside flows as bullish,\" he said.","Kruy noted that short ETH and long BTC has been a popular volatility spread trade this year. \"I believe some of this call buying is closing out of short ETH positions to monetize this spread,\" he said, \"rather than adding risk ahead of the event.\"","\"We have seen a bit of vol buying ahead of the event as a hedge,\" he said, \"just not much in comparison to overall BTC flows.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
