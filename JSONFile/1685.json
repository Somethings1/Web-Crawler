He spoke passionately about a $700 billion bailout package he voted against in 2008 at the encouragement of constituents who were later outraged at the same vote. \u201CI learned an important lesson. Do what you think is in the best interest of your constituents, even if they disagree.\u201D","The hearing took place before the subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

Will that happen?","Following the hearing, Green told The Block \"I hope regulators will see this as an opportunity to prevent a catastrophe.\" He was clear that he wanted existing regulators to step up to the challenge:","The day before the hearing, Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN) told The Block of his team's strategy: \"We're going to try to identify how, even though the laws aren't perfect, the laws already exist in the securities area in the commodity area.

He referenced notable spikes and drops in Bitcoin price over its history, asking Van Valkenburgh, \u201CAt any point, did the government have to step in to prop up crypto markets?\u201D","Van Valkenburgh answered that \u201Ccryptocurrency by definition is unbacked.
