The claim has been hotly contested by the exchange in its latest response.","The company argued that the SEC was applying securities laws to certain digital tokens in ways that significantly deviate from existing legal frameworks. Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/iampaulgrewal\/status\/1674271484263661569\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> that the SEC\u2019s claims \u201Cgo far beyond existing law\u201D and should, therefore, be dismissed.","In a legal <a href=\"https:\/\/assets.ctfassets.net\/c5bd0wqjc7v0\/4oVJN5EioULD0QnSyg01b8\/2b1f34594a800c727fb61a384f37e74a\/SEC_v._Coinbase__Coinbase_Answer_to_Complaint__As-Filed_.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">document<\/a> filed on Thursday with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York , Coinbase raised concerns about the SEC\u2019s interpretation of securities laws, suggesting the agency was reaching beyond its legal authority.","Filing a motion to dismiss underscores Coinbase\u2019s determination to challenge the SEC\u2019s lawsuit. A motion to dismiss argues that even if all the allegations in the lawsuit are true, the plaintiff does not have a valid legal claim.","\u201CEven if the SEC were correct that the assets and services it identifies are within the scope of its existing regulatory authority, this [legal] action must be dismissed on independent grounds that it violates Coinbase\u2019s due process rights and constitutes an extraordinary abuse of process,\u201D Coinbase\u2019s legal team stated in the filing.","As a U.S. government agency, the SEC requires that any platform facilitating the trading of assets, which it defines as securities, must register with it.","SEC's definition of a security includes investment contracts, which have been interpreted by the Supreme Court in the Howey Test to include transactions where individuals invest money in a common enterprise and expect profits primarily from the efforts of others. In its suit, the SEC named 12 crypto tokens as securities, including SOL, ADA, MATIC, SAND, FLOW, ICP, NEAR and DASH.","In the Thursday filing, Coinbase claimed that the digital assets in question are not securities. \u201CNone of the assets the SEC has now identified are in fact securities, and for that and other reasons, secondary transactions in those assets are also not securities,\u201D it stated.","The legal document further noted what the company described as inconsistencies in the SEC\u2019s decisions, emphasizing that the SEC had not raised objections to six of these tokens in their previous dealings with Coinbase in 2021.","The exchange's lawyers further argued that in 2021, the SEC declared Coinbase\u2019s registration statement with the commission effective, thereby permitting the company to sell its shares to investors when it went public.","The approval followed an extensive review process that spanned several months and involved in-depth discussions with Coinbase. The registration approval allowed Coinbase to trade more than 240 tokens on its spot exchange, including six of the 12 tokens now under dispute.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
