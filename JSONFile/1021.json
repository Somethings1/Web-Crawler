At that time, Bankman-Fried was Alameda\u2019s CEO.","To try to unfreeze them, Alameda first tried to hire a lawyer in China to negotiate with the government, but that proved futile. The firm then turned to what Ellison described as various trading strategies.","Asked to give an example, Ellison said, \u201COn OKX we made several accounts using the IDs of different people who I believe were Thai prostitutes, and we tried to basically have our main account lose money and have those other accounts make money, so do very imbalanced trades between the two accounts so those other accounts would be able to make money and withdraw it.\u201D","Another Alameda employee had mooted the idea of bribing a Chinese official to unlock the accounts. Bankman-Fried was initially against the idea, but eventually he warmed to it.","Asked how the accounts were eventually unfrozen, Ellison said, \u201CMy impression was that they were unfrozen by Alameda paying a bribe to Chinese government officials.\u201D","Bankman-Fried faces seven charges of fraud in this trial, but even if he\u2019s found innocent, he must then face a second trial \u2014 with five additional counts \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/legal\/what-charges-does-sam-bankman-fried-face-over-ftxs-collapse-2023-10-03\/#:~:text=Bankman%2DFried%20once%20faced%20as,trial%20scheduled%20for%20March%202024.\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">currently scheduled for March<\/a>. Those charges include bank fraud and foreign bribery conspiracy charges. Prosecutors claim the alleged bribe paid to a Chinese official constitutes a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
