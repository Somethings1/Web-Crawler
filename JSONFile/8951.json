This makes it possible for traders to buy the asset without the yield and vice versa.&nbsp;","\u201CBy enabling yield tokenization, Pendle helps to unlock more utility for other ecosystems,\u201D said Pendle CEO TN Lee, in a statement.","In the last few months, Pendle has partnered with protocols including Aura Finance, Balancer, Lido and RocketPool to add support for their assets. It has now partnered with decentralized exchange GMX, which runs on the Arbitrum network, to support its native asset.","Currently the protocol supports four staked ether tokens, Yuga Labs\u2019s apecoin, the stablecoin USDC (via Convex Finance) and LOOKS, the native token of the NFT marketplace LooksRare.","Until now, the protocol had only been available on Ethereum, where it faced higher fees, and Avalanche, which is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.","Â© 2023 The Block.
