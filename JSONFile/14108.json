Anyone can set up a validator node as long as they meet the staking requirement, otherwise users can pool their assets together by delegating their tokens to a validator and sharing in the rewards.&nbsp;","Binance's American subsidiary is launching its own product, with returns higher than current staking rewards elsewhere.","Binance.US <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.binance.us\/eth-staking\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> its own Ethereum staking product on Wednesday, notably offering a starting annual percentage yield (APY) of 6% \u2013 just three months after launching staking services.","Activating validator software requires users to deposit 32 ETH ($49,000), validators are responsible for \"storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain,\" <a href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/staking\/#:~:text=Further%20reading-,What%20is%20staking%3F,new%20ETH%20in%20the%20process.\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">per<\/a> the Ethereum website.
