Rolle that client assets possibly held by FTX were transferred to Alameda Research to cover the hedge fund's financial losses.","The transfer of customer assets was \u201Ccontrary to normal corporate governance and operations at FTX Digital,\u201D Rolle wrote in a Nov. 11 court document filed to the Supreme Court of the Bahamas, seeking an emergency intervention for the regulator to seize control of the company\u2019s remaining assets. \u201CPut simply, that such transfers were not allowed or consented to by their clients.\u201D&nbsp;","Salame\u2019s comments to the regulator also prompted her to alert the Bahamian police, requesting an investigation into the company, \u201Con an urgent basis.\u201D The request to police notes that Salame was in Washington, D.C. on Nov. 9.&nbsp;","The FTX DM co-CEO told officials that only three people had passwords necessary for the transfer: Bankman-Fried, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang. A Monday court filing by FTX\u2019s representatives in bankruptcy proceedings named Bankman-Fried and Wang as responsible for a separate shift in funds, as well as the minting of new tokens, after they had filed to start the bankruptcy process.","Rolle\u2019s request, which was granted by the court, was included in a new filing in the bankruptcy case today made by the Bahamian government in response to arguments in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, suggesting that it is coordinating with Bankman-Fried.","Lawyers for FTX, representing the company\u2019s new leadership, have argued that Bankman-Fried, Wang and Bahamian authorities, including the Securities Commission, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194385\/ftx-bankman-fried-bahamas-authorities\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">may have violated bankruptcy law<\/a> around movement of assets after initiating the process. The Bahamian regulator has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194637\/bahamas-ftx-ceo-statements-rejection\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">vigorously denied coordination<\/a> with Bankman-Fried, and filed these documents as evidence in support of its argument. The judge presiding over the case will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/195015\/legal-fight-escalates-around-collusion-between-bankman-fried-and-bahamian-government\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hear further arguments<\/a> on Friday, with a full hearing on the issue scheduled for Jan. 6.&nbsp;","The request came the day that Binance pulled out of its proposal to acquire FTX. Earlier this week, Bankman-Fried was arrested by Bahamian police, denied bail and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194667\/disgraced-former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-criminally-indicted\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">indicted<\/a> by a U.S. federal grand jury on several charges of fraud or conspiracy to commit fraud.&nbsp;","In her Nov. 9 request to the Bahamas Supreme Court, Rolle raised similar concerns to those raised now by FTX\u2019s lawyers: That Bankman-Fried offered in an email to the country\u2019s attorney general to fully refund Bahamian customers.","\u201CParticularly, SBF has advised that FTX has \u201Csegregated funds for Bahamian customers\u201D and are willing to allow those customers to withdraw those funds,\u201D Rolle wrote on Nov. 9. \u201CThe question that ultimately arises is whether such transactions would be characterized as voidable preferences under the insolvency regime and subsequently result in attempts to claw back funds from Bahamian customers.\u201D","\u201CIn any event, the Commission cannot condone preferential treatment of any investor or client of FTX Digital or otherwise,\u201D she added.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
