By fall 2018, Cambridge Blockchain had made contact with their corporate venture team.","PayPal also recently moved its European headquarters to Luxembourg, where the Massachusetts-based startup is focusing the first roll-out of its distributed identity system.","\u201CData privacy is becoming an increasingly important interest\u2026[and] we\u2019ve gotten most traction [and the highest pay-point] in the European banking market,\u201D Commons noted.","Buoyed by $10.5 million in raised capital, the firm is planning on using the blockchain to validate data and store attestations (\u201Clike fingerprints or scans\u201D) in cryptographic proofs. The idea is that once one party has stored on the data, they can share that validation with service providers seeking to onboard the customer without granting them access to other personal information.&nbsp;","\u201CWe\u2019ve found that a particular type of personal data \u2013 that related to onboarding, KYC \u2013 is one we can get paid for, so we\u2019re starting there,\u201D he noted. \u201CIt\u2019ll be much quicker.\u201D","The focus&nbsp;then will strictly be on b2b services, validating data needed to open accounts with banks and other financial institutions.","Asked why PayPal waited until the extended Series A, rather than the one that closed in May last year, Commons said it was a matter of gaining confidence.","\"It\u2019s a new space. People are figuring it out...we're happy they took their time. We learnt a lot in the diligence phase.\"","They may be in luck. Cambridge Blockchain is hoping to start operating later this year, having been in the works for four years and now driven by a team of 11 engineers. It\u2019ll also mean more fund-raising at some point.","\u201CIt probably won't be the last round.\"","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
