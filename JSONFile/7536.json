Gemini and Kraken-owned Crypto Facilities are among a few dozen firms to have made it on to the register.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As FTX expands in Europe and the Middle East, the firm has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/ftx-continues-global-expansion-with-the-establishment-of-ftx-europe-301496387.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">set up<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> a new division, led by Gruhn and known as FTX Europe. FTX Europe\u2019s main base is in Switzerland, with subsidiaries in Dubai and Cyprus, with the latter serving the European Economic Area.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gruhn, a 40-year-old German who joined FTX in September, explained that the UK market is tricky for FTX beacuse its main products are crypto derivatives, which the FCA <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/90130\/crypto-derivatives-ban-comes-into-effect-uk\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">banned<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in January. Hence the initial focus on spot trading products.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Brits can download FTX\u2019s app and open an account but the exchange isn\u2019t allowed to market its services in the UK, as it\u2019s as yet unlicensed.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While some crypto exchanges have historically tried to skirt financial regulations, Bahamas-based FTX is keen to work with the authorities as it grows. Gruhn was eager to stress that FTX, which was founded by Sam Bankman-Fried in 2019, has about 20 people on its legal team working to fulfill regulators\u2019 requests.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gruhn spoke via video from his beach house in Oregon, with the rising sun slowly illuminating the Pacific Ocean through the window behind him. He explained that he\u2019ll run the European unit from Oregon \u2013 a more convenient time zone for keeping up with headquarters in the Bahamas \u2014 with assistance from his colleague Robin Matzke in Berlin.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX\u2019s goal is to become the top crypto exchange in the European region. Gruhn acknowledged that the FTX brand is \u201Cnot really known\u201D among European retail investors as yet \u2014 but he said the company plans an ambitious marketing program that will include paid social media ads and sponsorship of music festivals \u2014 and may copy FTX\u2019s US strategy of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/heat\/news\/heat-partners-with-ftxus\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sponsoring sports events<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Accurately quantifying FTX\u2019s share of current European trading is almost impossible, as a huge chunk of transactions happen in US dollars rather than the euro.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Turning back to the UK, Gruhn was positive about the FCA\u2019s approach to crypto regulation. UK regulators aren\u2019t putting unreasonable burdens on operators, he argued \u2014 all they have to show is that they\u2019re \u201Cfit and proper\u201D people to be running an investment firm.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe UK takes a relatively balanced approach,\u201D Gruhn said. \u201CI know many crypto firms are complaining \u2018so much compliance,\u2019 but it\u2019s just because they are not used to it.\u201D<\/span>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","© 2023 The Block.
