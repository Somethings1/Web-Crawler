According to the statement, Borderless Capital has invested in more than 200 companies and protocols since 2018.","Garcia, who is from Argentina, said, \"CTF Capital has a huge concentration of both portfolio companies and limited partners from Latin America, a region we always wanted to expand into.\"","He also said the two firms have been discussing the acquisition for months.","CTF Capital is a Nassau-based, quantitative trading and asset management company that has worked with Borderless Capital for more than three years, according to Garcia. The quant firm launched its own crypto hedge fund in 2018.","\"In 2019, we saw the [way] to differentiate ourselves from other crypto hedge funds was to invest in technology and to develop that technology inside,\" CTF Capital CEO&nbsp;Brian Prilick told The Block. As part of the acquisition, Prilick is transitioning into a new role as a partner at Borderless Capital.","Prilick also said that in 2019, CTF Capital \"started working as market makers for these decentralized exchanges where there wasn't much activity, transactionally, nor other market makers.\" Eventually, CTF Capital developed a proprietary platform offering three different products: high-frequency trading, AI and machine learning strategies for high- and low-frequency trading, and on-chain strategies.&nbsp;","By CTF Capital folding its assets under management into Borderless Capital's flagship fund, the firm's investors will be able to participate in larger-volume trades, according to Prilick.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
