On Ethereum, staking requires users to lock their ETH. That staked ETH is then utilized for establishing consensus, validating transactions, and securing the network. While those tokens are locked up, they cannot be traded. Liquid staking is a way around this.","Since it is already possible to stake ETH, services like Lido have arisen to let users exchange ETH for a derivative token that can be used in DeFi protocols. Lido\u2019s version is called stETH. &nbsp;","Coinbase's white paper for cbETH highlighted current issues in the liquid staking market that it says may pose a danger to Ethereum. Thus far, liquid staking has been dominated by Lido, which maintains approximately a 90% market share. &nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n","","","A breach of a consensus threshold would introduce significant risks to Ethereum\u2019s security. &nbsp;","\u201CToday the liquid staking market on Ethereum is dominated by a single solution that is on the verge of breaching 33% network penetration (the first consensus threshold),\u201D Coinbase wrote in the white paper. \u201CTherefore, it is necessary for the liquid staking market to have strong, competing solutions with differentiated qualities.\u201D&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
