But the startup closed the round within a few months, which is an equity-plus-token-warrants round, according to Moisejevs. He declined to comment on the valuation.","By calling itself \"the Blur of Solana,\" Tensor references its NFT marketplace for pro traders on Solana \u2014 like how <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210668\/nft-marketplace-blur-raise-billion-dollar-valuation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blur<\/a> is on Ethereum.

Moisejevs and his other co-founder, Richard Wu, see NFTs as an \"extremely high potential\" market. \"Everything that's digital and unique will be an NFT,\" according to Moisejevs.","Wu said today's marketplaces for NFTs are slow and that \"the pros aren't going to wait 30 seconds for a transaction to confirm and pay $1000s in fees eroding their trading profits \u2014 they want it Ferrari-fast and dirt-cheap, and Solana's 400ms consensus is the only way to deliver it.\"","While Solana may be faster and cheaper than Ethereum, the trading volume of Solana-based NFTs is much lower than that of Ethereum-based NFTs, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/nft-overview\/nft-trade-volume-by-chain\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to The Block's Data Dashboard.<\/a>&nbsp;Solana has also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/215191\/solana-blockchain-impacted-by-technical-issue\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suffered<\/a> multiple network outages since its launch in 2020.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/nft-overview\/nft-trade-volume-by-chain\/embed\" title=\"NFT Trade Volume by Chain\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","But Tensor plans to follow a similarly aggressive user acquisition on Solana as Blur did on Ethereum. It recently <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tensor_hq\/status\/1632803117606764544\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> a new incentives program that will reward any Solana-based NFT traders. It is also planning a second program to reward only those who traded on TensorSwap.","Tensor was bootstrapped entirely off prize money from winning two Solana hackathons. Its team is lean, with the two co-founders and its recently made first hire \u2014 KRTrades_ or \"Stringray\" \u2014 a pseudonymous crypto trader. Stringray will help Tensor bring new liquidity to NFTs and Solana in particular, Tensor said. The startup plans to stay lean in the near future and is currently looking to add two founding engineers, said Moisejevs.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
