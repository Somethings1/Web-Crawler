I was still doing my day to day.\u201D","For all appearances, Cronje left the Fantom Foundation in March 2022 and had supposedly quit contributing to the DeFi space and crypto in general. This caused a drop in the price of FTM at the time.&nbsp;","While no reason was specifically given, Cronje has come under fire multiple times in the past due to his tendency to \u201Ctest in production\u201D \u2014 that is, to put unaudited code live while he was building it. A few times, crypto observers aped into his contracts on their own volition, before a bug or other issue caused them to lose their funds. (Following the publication of this article, Cronje said via email that the code was actually audited but that he didn't disclose this. He said, \u201Cthe code I shared was audited, I just did not publicly disclose those audits as I felt doing so would give members of the community a false sense of security when testing these new contracts.\")","\u201CI just thought it would do more reputational damage than harm,\u201D he said about distancing himself from the project.&nbsp;","Cronje added that it was Fantom Foundation CEO Michael Kong who finally convinced him to make a public return. \u201CAnd I finally caved after a few months of attrition and then just, you know, decided to admit. But that wasn't actually a leave and back. It was just a public distancing, which at the time I thought was better for the project.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Added follow up comment from Cronje.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
