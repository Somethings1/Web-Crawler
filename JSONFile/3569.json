The company says it \u201Cplan[s] to support other European countries in the oncoming months.\u201D","However, there are some fees attached, unlike with normal domestic Visa transactions. Issuing the card costs £4.95 ($6.48) and will charge 2.49% on each purchase (1.49% crypto conversion fee + 1% transaction fee). There is also a spending cap of £10,000 ($13,092) per day. There is no maintenance fee, but reversing a transaction will cost £20 ($26.19)","Whether the Brexit-weary country has an appetite for the card remains to be seen. Sources suggest Swift was discontinued due to low demand, though unconfirmed.","\u201CI doubt there will be high demand or usage for it until people are incentivized to spending crypto, maybe more appealing in edging markets,\u201D said Paul Veradittakit, a partner at Pantera.","\u201CThere are several challenges. People are not used to buying sandwiches with Apple stock, and most crypto assets fall into a similar mental bucket,\u201D said Lex Sokolin, former director of Autonomous research. \u201CRiding the open loop networks of Visa and MasterCard is a faster way to market, but not a transformational one in terms of industry economics.\u201D Nonetheless, he praised Coinbase\u2019s experience in the payment field and said the step was a \u201Cstrategic option.\"","In 2017, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/london-block-exchange-launches-prepaid-cryptocurrency-debit-card-2017-11?r=US&amp;IR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">London Block Exchange planned to issue a prepaid Visa debit card<\/a> to convert crypto to GBP, with a £20 up-front fee. However, supply-complications meant it never reached the market.","In that sense, the Coinbase card is the first of its kind for a major crypto exchange in the UK. \u201CMaking crypto easier to use and spend is central to our mission to create a more open financial system,\" said UK CEO at Coinbase, Zeeshan Feroz.&nbsp;","A spokesperson clarified that crypto, equivalent to the amount spent, is liquidated immediately into fiat ensuring the correct value is captured at the time of the transaction.
