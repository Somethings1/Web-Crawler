Auto-Transfers creates and sends PAX across different exchanges with very little time lag, which allows them to take advantage of market rallies. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe\u2019re closing the barriers between physical and digital assets. The faster and easier you can <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">get your PAX, the faster you can transact with your assets,\u201D Wells said<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A few weeks ago, Paxos announced an overhaul of its exchange platform <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/05\/13\/stablecoin-pax-can-now-be-redeemed-instantly-on-an-integrated-platform-with-exchange-itbit\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">to support instant redemption of PAX to U.S. dollars<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. The move was an attempt to boost PAX\u2019s presence in the stablecoin market. Now, the speedy creation and transfer of PAX between wallets may help further advance that endeavor by making PAX \u201Cthe fastest way to get from USD to crypto assets,\u201D according to Wells. <\/span>","\"By increasing the speed at which you can create, redeem and use PAX, we\u2019re also providing another layer of confidence to our customers as it improves their experience and they can ensure their funds are always available and accessible,\" said Wells.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
