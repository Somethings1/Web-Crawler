Pub. Utility Dist. №2 of Grant Cty. Wash., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54423 (E.D. Wash. 2019) [SDP]<\/strong><\/em>","Cryptocurrency litigation really runs the gamut. This particular opinion takes us deep into the really exciting world of electricity rate setting. OK, maybe electricity rates aren\u2019t that exciting \u2026 unless you are cryptocurrency miner, like the plaintiffs are in this case, and that case rates are the difference between big bucks and big losses.","The Plaintiffs here are a group of tech firms mostly focused on crypto mining. They asked a federal judge in Washington State to enjoin the Grant County Public Utility District (\u201CPUD\u201D) from implementing a new rate class which would substantially increase electricity rates charged to \u201Cevolving industries,\u201D which would include crypto miners. The Court declined to grant the injunction because it found that the rate wasn\u2019t discriminatory, arbitrary, or made without due process, and it didn't violate the miners\u2019 constitutional rights.","The Court begins its analysis by explaining blockchain tech and mining in general. It points out that one of a miner\u2019s biggest expenses (the biggest?) is electricity, so miners locate themselves places with cheap electricity, like Washington State, apparently, with its cheap hydroelectric power.","This particular PUD is a Washington State municipal corporation and claims to have the cheapest electricity in the country. It sets rates based on operations and power consumption, and different industries are grouped together. To deal with the significant interest from mining industry, it created an \u201Cevolving industry\u201D rate class for miners.","Suffice it to say that the local mining industry didn\u2019t like this new rate class because they said it would increase their rates between 295% to 400%, effective April 1, which I am sure was just a coincidence.","Utility rates in Washington State are presumed reasonable, the Court says, \u201Cand courts will only overturn the rates if they are excessive and disproportionate to the services rendered or arbitrary and capricious.\u201D The Court rejected Plaintiff\u2019s challenge, noting in particular that it \u201Cfails to recognize\" one of the main aspects of the District\u2019s justification for classifying cryptocurrency mining as an evolving industry: the sudden influx of interest from cryptocurrency mining companies in the District\u2019s area of service. According to the District, since the summer of 2017, it has received \"125 requests for service totaling 2,000 MW of new load, 75% of the new load being from cryptocurrency mining operations.\u201D","Plaintiffs raise a couple of other arguments\u200A\u2014\u200Aincluding alleged violation of federal and state due process rights\u200A\u2014\u200Aand the Court shoots these down as well in the opinion. Now this is not a final order and it can certainly be vacated, appealed or modified at some point, but for now it shows that one of the real business risks associated with mining is long-term assurance of electricity pricing. Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies are in one way of thinking a form of electricity arbitrage. If pricing can go up by 400 percent because some PUD says so, that\u2019s a significant risk to consider at the outset. And as this opinion shows\u200A\u2014\u200Aat least in the U.S.\u200A\u2014\u200Arate challenges are not a straight over tackle proposition.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
