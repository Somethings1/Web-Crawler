A court in the British Virgin Islands previously ordered Three Arrows' local branch to enter into liquidation, indicating that Friday's filing is likely tied to this. U.S.-based firm Teneo Restructuring has been tapped to oversee the liquidations.","The firm borrowed large amounts of funds from several crypto lenders, including BlockFi, Celsius, Babel Finance and Voyager Digital, but was unable to pay. The lenders halted withdrawals or needed credit lines extended to weather the storm.
