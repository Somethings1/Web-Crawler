Masks and party hats acquired from Halloween and Christmas giveaways in RuneScape\u2019s early days became some of the game\u2019s most valuable items. They had no ostensible use beyond display. Their sole value was their scarcity \u2014 a term that excites many a crypto enthusiast.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But it\u2019s what RuneScape players could do with their money and rare items, once acquired, that so imprinted the game on the minds of web3 folk.

I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really important in the crypto gaming and NFT space as well \u2014 understanding how value is created and exchanged.\u201D<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At its most basic level, two RuneScape players choosing to trade with one another involves bartering over the exchange of a combination of goods and gold pieces (GP). In time, clusters of hundreds of players began forming in hotspots like Falador Park and a bank in the west of Varrock. Here, sellers would advertise their wares with colorful floating messages, while buyers hunted for a bargain.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The game even appealed to arbitrageurs, who made a living trading off price inefficiencies in these informal market hubs. (And while this happens in all sorts of markets, it may be worth noting that crypto arbitrageurs, too, have long made a killing trading off price inefficiencies between exchanges.) In RuneScape, this process is known as \u201Cmerching.\u201D Metav3rse\u2019s Slocum, who played RuneScape from age seven up to 19 and would skip school \u201Ca few times a week\u201D to stay up playing until 4 a.m., said merching taught players the basics of supply and demand. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The makers of RuneScape soon gave players a more efficient means of price discovery through the launch, in 2007, of the Grand Exchange, an automated trading system that gave buyers and sellers a way to post orders without interacting with other players directly, with prices varying based on supply and demand. As crypto Twitter <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Cooopahtroopa\/status\/1429668205774065665?s=20&amp;t=HEaXmp_BSzJdAidc7NsXwA\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">puts it<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, the Grand Exchange became for RuneScape what OpenSea is to NFTs.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMore than anything, RuneScape and its Grand Exchange showed that there is actual value in the time gamers put into the games they play and the associated rewards they gain,\u201D said Sam Lehman, an investor at Symbolic Capital, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/165671\/polygon-and-cere-network-founders-launch-50-million-web3-fund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the $50 million web3 venture fund<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. \u201CThe concept is so inherent to web3 gaming it may sound obvious, but around the time of RuneScape it was a largely novel concept to let gamers sell, buy, and trade the items they earned in game.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Evidence for Lehman\u2019s case \u2014 that players care about their stuff \u2014 may be found in the fact that RuneScape offers PIN-protected, in-game bank accounts in which gp and loot can be stowed. While such accounts may fall short of offering an immutable record of ownership, they\u2019ve certainly proven somewhat durable. A player could be absent from the RuneScape for a decade and check in to find their estate just as they left it.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Similar marketplaces to RuneScape\u2019s Grand Exchange have since emerged elsewhere in the gaming sector, Lehman added.
