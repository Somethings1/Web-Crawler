The AEUR-USDT trading pair peaked at $3.25 on Tuesday, significantly higher than its expected value of around $1.07.","This deviation from the stablecoin\u2019s intended value was attributed to a misunderstanding by some Binance traders, whom the exchange said seemed unaware of AEUR\u2019s nature as a stablecoin. \u201CAs AEUR has been well-received by the community, including users who might not have realized its standing as a stablecoin, there was strong demand for AEUR, which resulted in its price deviation,\u201D a Binance spokesperson told The Block.","Notably, the AEUR stablecoin had limited liquidity due to its supply of five million on the platform, as indicated on its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/price\/anchored-coins-aeur\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dedicated page<\/a>.

This suspension affected AEUR\/USDT, BTC\/AEUR, ETH\/AEUR, and EUR\/AEUR pairs.","Today, the exchange has created a compensation plan for those who purchased the stablecoin above its intended value. Traders who bought AEUR between 12:41 p.m. EST and 1:31 p.m. EST on Tuesday and did not sell them on Binance will be eligible for compensation. This process is set to begin within the next three days.&nbsp;","The exchange didn't reveal the total amount given as compensation to traders."],"hashtag":["BINANCE"]}
