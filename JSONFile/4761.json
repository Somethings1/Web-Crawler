The argument made by the former FTX and Alameda Research CEO\u2019s defense team also seeks to paint the trading platform\u2019s practices as standard in the crypto industry, and lay blame with the U.S. government over its regulatory wrangling around digital assets over the last several years.","Calling the U.S. government\u2019s pursuit of Bankman-Fried \u201Ca classic rush to judgment,\u201D the FTX and Alameda owner\u2019s defense team argues that shortcomings leading to FTX\u2019s demise are common throughout the crypto industry. They also contend the company\u2019s failure stems from a broader crypto winter, rather than reported failure to back FTX\u2019s native token FTT, or secret loans from FTX to Alameda alleged by both prosecutors and the bankruptcy team put in place to manage the repayment of FTX customers and creditors.","\u201CLike many other cryptocurrency market participants, and many other start-ups that experience exponential growth in a short period, FTX did not have fully developed controls and risk management protocols,\u201D Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers told the judge presiding over the case. \u201CFTX, like other market participants, was susceptible to a broader market collapse.\u201D","Bankman-Fried\u2019s team also argues that \u201Cevery major participant\u201D in the crypto industry \u201Ccratered,\u201D and draws parallels between the collapse of different digital asset firms and the 2008 global financial crisis, the catalyst for the popularity of bitcoin and growth of digital assets.","In the motions filed with the federal Southern District of New York, Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense team argues that a conviction in either of two pairs of charges would be a conviction for the same crime, since the charges stem from similar portions of the law. Defendants cannot be convicted twice for the same crime in the U.S., termed a right against \"double jeopardy.\"","The early defense effort argues that going to trial with multiple criminal charges that, in their eyes, could be canceled out by others he faces may lead to \u201Cundue prejudice\u201D in his trial. It may also be an early effort by the defense to undermine the credibility of prosecutors in the eyes of a court or a future jury.","The pairs of charges in question are a charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and another of conspiracy to commit wire fraud on FTX customers; and a charge of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and another for conspiracy to commit commodities fraud on FTX customers. Bankman-Fried argues these pairs of charges are redundant, and that one of the charges from each pair should be withdrawn.","In separate but related motions to dismiss, the defense team also makes a series of more obscure legal arguments against other charges, including that the Bahamian government did not give its consent for some of the allegations brought against Bankman-Fried when it agreed to extradite him.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
