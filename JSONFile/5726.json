Some even tell us straight up that they're here for profits, not crypto, and we praise them for their honesty. Yet we're surprised when they turn out to be who they said they are. We need to raise our standards,\u201D he said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jespow\/status\/1590635242087657473\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweet thread<\/a>.","Kraken is one of several companies with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185138\/which-crypto-companies-have-exposure-to-ftx?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">exposure to FTX<\/a>.

Binance then signed a non-binding letter of intent to buy the rival exchange. Yesterday, after seeing FTX\u2019s financials, it backed out of the deal.","\u201CAn exchange implosion of this magnitude is a gift to bitcoin haters all over the world.
