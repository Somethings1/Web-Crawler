CEO Sergey Gorbunov said. \u201CPublic blockchains provide fast finality and transparency, and these attributes can be difference-makers in hybrid systems that integrate real-world assets as well as private blockchains and off-chain systems.\u201D","\u201CJPMorgan and Apollo\u2019s use case is exactly why we designed interoperable private and permissioned Provenance Blockchain Zones,\u201D Provenance Blockchain CEO Anthony Moro added. \u201CWith the support of Axelar and Oasis Pro, JPMorgan and Apollo demonstrated how portfolios could be rebalanced and trades executed between Onyx Digital Assets and Provenance Blockchain. This is believed to be a first-of-its-kind blockchain interoperability solution for institutional financial services.\u201D","LayerZero also connected to Onyx with a permissioned Avalanche Evergreen Subnet, facilitating subscriptions and redemptions for WisdomTree funds. Avalanche Evergreen Subnets are individual blockchains customized for institutional applications, with features including EVM compatibility, smart contract deployment, network privacy and custom gas features.","\u201CThis initiative under Project Guardian fundamentally aligns with Ava Labs\u2019 mission to provide the tools and tech to digitize and tokenize the world\u2019s assets while harnessing the speed, scalability and customizability of Avalanche,\u201D Ava Labs President John Wu said.","Oasis Pro \u2014 not to be confused with the privacy-focused blockchain Oasis Network \u2014 enabled the tokenization of assets, such as Apollo funds, on the platform. \u201CSuccessfully delivering the solutions for portfolio rebalancing is a critical step in the evolution of traditional asset-management functions,\u201D Oasis Pro CEO Pat LaVecchia said. \u201CThis next generation of technology will increase speed and efficiency across legacy systems.\u201D","Concepts such as Biconomy\u2019s Paymaster service also abstracted away the complexities of interacting with blockchains, including the need to pay for blockchain transaction fees.","The proof-of-concept is the latest foray into blockchain-based financial services for JPMorgan after rolling out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/262595\/jpmorgan-jpm-coin-programmable-payments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">automatic payments<\/a> via its permissioned JPM Coin platform last week \u2014 a system that now handles <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/259580\/jpmorgan-jpm-coin-billion-daily-transactions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$1 billion<\/a> in daily transactions.","In October, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255829\/jpmorgan-blockchain-collateral-settlement-blackrock-barclays\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JPMorgan's Tokenized Collateral Network<\/a>, a blockchain-based collateral settlement application, went live, enabling clients to utilize tokenized assets as collateral and completing its first transaction involving BlackRock and Barclays.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated throughout to reflect involvement from WisdomTree, Avalanche, LayerZero and Biconomy.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
