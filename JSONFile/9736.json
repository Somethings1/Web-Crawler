Proponents argue they are a necessary source of revenue for creators, particularly for smaller collections, and an artists' ability to continue earning after the initial sale is one of the key advantages NFTs have over physical art. Others argue that royalties undermine the idea of true ownership and that holders shouldn't have to pay out additional funds.","DeGods founder, who is known as Frank, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/frankdegods\/status\/1558623075008098305\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">previously called<\/a> royalties \u201Cthe best alignment of incentives between founders and holders (right now)\u201D and warned those circumventing royalties not to be mad when \u201Cmints become more expensive and more projects rug.\" The team also floated the idea of removing some utility from NFTs not sold through approved marketplaces.","But now the company is switching course, with Frank citing data showing the growing popularity of 0% royalty marketplaces as a major factor.&nbsp;","\u201CNo good solutions are really out there for enforcing royalties and 0% markets are literally growing like weeds in terms of how many there are, pure user growth and volume growth filtered for wash trading. When you look at the data, it's just kind of hard to believe in my mind that most of these [other] marketplaces will not go to 0% royalties,\u201D he said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/spaces\/1YqJDoMzvekGV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter Space<\/a> following the announcement.","While the likes of OpenSea and Magic Eden have remained steadfast in their support of royalties, new marketplaces and competitors have taken a more flexible approach. Platforms that have popped up in the past year, like SudoSwapAMM and YAWWW, allow users to purchase NFTs without paying royalties.","Low-fee marketplace X2Y2, which flipped OpenSea by monthly sales volume in July, introduced a flexible royalty option in August that allows buyers to choose how much they wish to give back to creators.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/nft-marketplace-monthly-volume\/embed\" title=\"NFT Marketplace Monthly Volume\" width=\"250%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\" data-v-f87c67ca>﻿<\/span><\/iframe>","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/solana-nft-marketplace-volume\/embed\" title=\"Solana NFT Marketplace Volume\" width=\"250%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\" data-v-f87c67ca>﻿<\/span><\/iframe>","Frank argued that as 0% royalty marketplaces grow their market share, other marketplaces may ultimately remove royalty requirements in order to remain competitive. Without any way to prevent people circumventing royalties, he added that the model was \u201Calready broken\u201D for the DeGods project, as it is bringing in decreasing revenues even as popularity grows.","The question that remains is what impact dwindling royalty revenues could have on creators.
