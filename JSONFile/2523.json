This past week saw major regulatory developments in the digital assets sector. U.S. Congress members proposed a bill banning algo stables, a DAO and all of its voting members were targeted by the CFTC and market-making firm Wintermute suffered a $160 million exploit.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Here are the details on these three stories:&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On Tuesday, market-making firm Wintermute suffered a<\/span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/171135\/crypto-market-maker-wintermute-hacked-for-160-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$160 million hack<\/span><\/a> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on its Ethereum vault address, making it one of the largest recent crypto hacks.

Extracting the private key, a hacker was able to take over the specific address and use its admin privilege to then drain Wintermute\u2019s vault.

So far it has not heard back from the perpetrator.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Some U.S. Congress members proposed a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/171565\/draft-stablecoin-bill-in-congress-to-require-fed-state-regulator-approval\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">draft bill<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to create a federal framework for stablecoins. One of the proposals is a ban on algorithmic stablecoins backed by \"endogenous collateral,\" or internal collateral that stablecoin issuers create by themselves. Such cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins include assets that work similarly to the now-collapsed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/146444\/terra-luna-and-ust-how-we-got-here\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TerraUSD<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> (UST), whose value was supported using an algorithm as well as the project's own asset, called LUNA.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If passed, the bill would ban algorithmic stablecoins for two years and provide that dollar-denominated stablecoins be backed with cash or highly liquid assets like U.S. Treasury bonds. The draft bill also proposes that issuers of stablecoins who launch without approval from appropriate regulators may be penalized with five years in prison and a $1 million fine.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On Sept. 22, the crypto sector witnessed yet another regulatory development concerning decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
