Country-specific solutions lack the necessary size and scale, and national fragmentation has paralyzed competition and stifled innovation on the pan-European level,\u201D Coeure said. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nEuropean Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis also said at the time that his team is planning to launch a pan-European instant payment system by the end of 2021. Europe already has an instant payment system called TIPS [Target Instant Payment Settlement], but banks have reportedly been slow to join and it has not had a significant impact so far. The Association of German Banks, a lobby group of more than 200 private commercial banks, also recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/45311\/association-of-over-200-german-private-banks-calls-for-digital-euro\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">called<\/a> for digital euro and a common pan-European payments platform.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe U.S. has also been working to make its payments systems more efficient.
