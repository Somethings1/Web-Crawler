Elsewhere Ripple's XRP token clocked the largest gains of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, up 11.30%, as the token builds momentum following developments in its SEC trial.&nbsp;","Markets will now look to next Thursday's inflation data as the Fed has fought inflation with rate hikes, and any sign that inflation is stemming may be taken positively by markets hoping for a Fed pivot. Still, a pivot is looking increasingly unlikely, especially as Neel Kashkari said the Fed is quite a way from pausing rate hikes.&nbsp;","From Coinbase to Silvergate, Friday was a bad day for crypto stocks.&nbsp;","\"While weak data earlier in the week fueled expectations that the Fed could consider a less hawkish stance, the market appears to have come to its senses. With inflation still over four times the Fed\u2019s 2% target and the jobs market still strong, any dovish pivot is likely still a long way off,\" Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index, said of the market moving lower.&nbsp;","Jack Dorsey's Block (née Square) fell more than 7.3% on Tuesday, trading at $57.41 at the the close on Friday, according to Nasdaq data via TradingView.
