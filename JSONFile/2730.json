The protocol is the product of a collaboration between Keep Network, an Ethereum-based system for privately storing data off-chain, and Summa, which provides tools for cross-chain communication.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On Monday, tBTC's developers launched the network's platform token, called KEEP, which is required to play the role of a \"signer.\" Signers create and control smart contracts that take in bitcoin deposits and mint tBTC tokens. The team also released the smart contracts required for holding and staking assets.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As of now, signers will consist of project partners, employees, affiliates, and private purchasers like A16z and Polychain. According to tBTC project lead Matt Luongo, around 80 to 100 stakers will be ready to sign at tBTC's launch. In June, Keep will host a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.crowdcast.io\/e\/keep-stakedrop---live\/register\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stakedrop event<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, through which anyone will be able to stake <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/mapping-out-ethereums-defi-15376\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ETH<\/a> to receive Keep tokens and become the protocol's signers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Next week, the project will deploy the dashboard for the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dapp.test.tbtc.network\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tBTC DApp<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and the remaining infrastructure.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On May 11, the whole tBTC system will be ready for public use. Anyone will be able to deposit limited funds into the DApp, although Luongo told The Block that users should \"take it slow\" since it will still be a new system.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There are a number of other projects \u2013 including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), ImToken's imBTC, Synthetix's sBTC \u2013 that try to bring Bitcoin liquidity to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/mapping-out-ethereums-open-finance-1480\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum<\/a>. Each of these tokens allows bitcoin holders to access decentralized finance (DeFi) services through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/on-chain-activity-under-the-microscope-ethereum-hashrate-steady-despite-issuance-reduction-makerdao-stability-fee-hike-moves-to-executive-vote-15133\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum<\/a> blockchain. What makes tBTC unique, however, is its clear path for redemption, which makes it relatively easy for users to get their bitcoins back if they want to.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With tBTC, users can go to the tBTC DApp, generate a bitcoin wallet address, deposit their bitcoin into that address, and the get a minted tBTC token in their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/on-chain-activity-under-the-microscope-uniswap-leads-eth-mkr-market-difficulty-bomb-dampens-ethereum-issuance-11571\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum<\/a> wallet. If they want their bitcoin back, they can redeem it on the DApp and send the bitcoin to their selected wallet address.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to a statement to The Block, Compound and MakerDAO are both set to list tBTC on their platforms.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Luongo said that Compound has already integrated with tBTC on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/ethereum-core-dev-call-54-waiting-for-progpow-10033\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum<\/a> test network Ropsten. He hopes that users will someday be able to take out USD loans with tBTC collateral using the lending protocol, but he also acknowledged that this will ultimately be up to Compound.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Indeed, Compound CEO Robert Leshner previously told The Block that they need to more accurately assess tBTC's liquidity and security after observing the token's mainnet performance before deciding whether it can become a collateral option.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The MakerDAO community, meanwhile, voted last week to whitelist tBTC and approve its ETH\/BTC price oracle, meaning that Maker will maintain the price feed for tBTC. Maker also plans to eventually allow users to use tBTC to mint DAI stablecoin, according to Luongo. He said that the approval of the price feed is \"a huge step forward\" toward bringing bitcoin collateral to MakerDAO.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The Maker team has been an excellent resource building tBTC, and we're pleased MKR holders just voted to deploy an ETH\/BTC price feed to power tBTC,\" said Luongo. \"The inclusion of tBTC as collateral will be subject to a vote by MKR holders. Once they do that, we'll be off to the races.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Besides MakerDao and Compound, tBTC's launch partners also include Uniswap, OasisDEX, Balancer, Kyber, Wyre, 1inch, and a number of other prominent projects.<\/span>"],"hashtag":["DAI","UNISWAP"]}
