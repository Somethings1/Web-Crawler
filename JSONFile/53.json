There is not a single piece of information on the site that represents an honest attempt at creating new technology or representing how that technology will be created. And yet the Pre-ICO countdown clock ticks forward with no regulatory body moving to shut down this site ahead of its offering of worthless tokens to investors in return for real money. This story has played out hundreds of times before \u2014 and each time the faith of the public at large is shaken and the reputation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem suffers.<\/span>","Here we explore each part of the project as presented to reveal how basic and easy to create this scam project is.","<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Team<\/strong>","We were first alerted to the existence of Qbase by the tweet and thread below in which it was clear that Qbase had ripped a real person\u2019s profile off LinkedIn, given her a new name and fraudulently represented that she was their community manager.","So <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/qbase_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@qbase_io<\/a>, since you falsely have on your site I\u2019m your Community Manager, how about those paychecks? <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSeriously tho, remove me, my name, my likeness, my LinkedIn, and my bio immediately from your website &amp; anywhere else as an employee or you\u2019ll be hearing from a lawyer. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/30mIl2JbGm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pic.twitter.com\/30mIl2JbGm<\/a>","<script async=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/script>","Upon learning of this fraud, we checked out the website and noticed another prominent investor fraudulently represented under *her own name* as Managing Director of the Qbase project.","Well, guess this is a story for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheBlock__?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@TheBlock__<\/a> !

A novel solution accomplishes this without any trusted central authority: the maintenance of the blockchain is performed by a network of communicating nodes running cryptocurrency software.This allows Qbase software to determine when a particular cryptocurrency amount has been spent, which is necessary in order to prevent double-spending in an environment without central oversight.\u201D&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hmm, sounds an awful lot like a paper I read written by someone named Satoshi 10 years ago\u2026<\/em>","\u201CHow the Token Works: In the blockchain, Qbase can be stored on any ERC20 compatible wallet address.

It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator. The network is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.\u201D&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Um, er, uh, sure, ok\u2026have you heard of this little cryptocurrency called Bitcoin?<\/em>","<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Presale Bonus<\/strong>","This is all about money.
