CZ's tweet added to existing pressure on FTT, which makes up a sizable portion of FTX sister trading firm Alameda Research's balance sheet, CoinDesk reported.&nbsp;","While Alameda's CEO Caroline Ellison said the leaked information only represents a portion of the firm's entire balance sheet, CZ's announcement resulted in a volatile session for FTT, which saw $300 million in trading volumes across FTX and Binance\u2014the highest level in more than a year.
