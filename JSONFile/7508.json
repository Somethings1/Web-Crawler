The Singapore-based company has amassed a considerable stash of Art Blocks NFTs this year, including no less than ten items from generative artist Tyler Hobbs\u2019s \u2018Fidenza\u2019 collection \u2013 for which it paid up to 320 ether (just over $1 million) apiece. But this latest purchase is by some way the most Three Arrows Capital has splashed on an NFT.","\u201CWe believe we are at the forefront of a multi-decade generative art movement, being ushered in by Art Blocks, and we think the best way to gain exposure to this trend is by collecting the defining pieces from the highest regarded sets such as Ringers, Fidenzas, Archetypes, and Subscapes,\u201D said Zhu Su, CEO of Three Arrows Capital.&nbsp;","Shortly after the purchase, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dmitricherniak?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cherniak tweeted<\/a>: \u2018Good day at the JPEG factory.\u2019","The deal is <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/art-blocks?search%5bsortAscending%5d=false&amp;search%5bsortBy%5d=LAST_SALE_PRICE\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the largest sum<\/a> spent on an Art Blocks piece to date, the previous record standing at 1000 ether (or around $2.6 million).
