So far, that means signing the letter of interest, offering to provide wallets for the RSK tokens and making available the assistance of multiple employees.","Casares told CoinDesk:","While all the companies involved can accurately be described as bitcoin companies, not all of them work only with bitcoin. JAXX, for example, makes a wallet designed to work with any cryptocurrency, and BitGo provides security services across blockchains.","With the timing of the launch following ethereum's struggle to execute a hard fork, the announcement could easily be seen as an opportunistic play to strike at an ostensible competitor.","But Kurman said the timing is coincidental, pointing to multiple companies who plan to join the federation and also offer ethereum services.","\"Our target is to enable financial services for the poorest people in the world,\" he said. \"Going out in a rush or profiting from someone else's nightmare is not our way to do things.\"","In interview with CoinDesk, JAXX CEO and ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio said that building smart contracts on bitcoin would allow for a \"more robust\" blockchain ecosystem to flourish.","BitGo co-founder and CTO Ben Davenport also confirmed that his company is participating in the federation. \"Our decisions for what blockchains to support are largely customer-driven,\" Davenport said. \"But we like the Rootstock team, and the general idea of what they're trying to do.\"","Kurman concluded:","Tumeric is the next version of the testnet, which the company expects to release by the end of September 2016. This will be followed by the launch of its ginger production network during the first quarter of next year.","While the initial letters of interest in the RSK federation have already been signed, Rootstock said the final documentation to recognize the group is expected to be completed by the end of this year.","Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Rootstock.","Ropes image via Shutterstock"],"entity":[{"type":"RSK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"San Francisco","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Anthony Di Iorio","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kurman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Casares","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lotus","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wences Casares","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shutterstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Xapo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Toronto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"May 2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Rootstock","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Buenos Aires","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hong Kong","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ben Davenport","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"September 2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Palo Alto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bitfinex","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Georgia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Digital Currency Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"first quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"RSK Federation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Davenport","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gabriel Kurman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CTO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Atlanta","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Luxembourg","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Technology","smart contracts","News","Rootstock","Technology News"],"authors":["Michael del Castillo"]}
