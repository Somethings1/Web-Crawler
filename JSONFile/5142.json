Once the window passes, all current filings can no longer be accepted simultaneously this year \u2014 as it's unlikely a filing would be accepted during its comment window \u2014 shifting emphasis to the next deadline on Jan. 10, K33 Research analysts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/263127\/bitcoin-etp-exposure-hits-all-time-highs-approval-window-spot-etfs-nears-end\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> earlier this week.","With the bill approved, momentum for a potential bitcoin spot ETF approval is maintained, keeping alive Matrixport\u2019s year-end price target of $45,000, Thielen added. This was initially set in February when bitcoin was trading at $22,500.","With the latest inflation data on Nov. 14 revealing a fall in the U.S. CPI from 3.7% to 3.2%, lower than expected, Matrixport forecasts a further decline to 1.6% in 2024. Such a drop could lead to significant interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve (150-200 basis points), fueling a continued rally in risk-on assets like tech stocks and cryptocurrencies, Thielen said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thielen also reiterated expectations that this \u201Cfifth bitcoin bull market\u201D would last until December 2024, roughly six months after <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -0.86%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span>\u2019s next expected halving event in April \u2014 when the block reward gets cut in half \u2014 with a price target of $125,000.<\/span>","Matrixport projects Ethereum's revenues to reach $171 million this month \u2014 the highest since May \u2014 hinting at a period of potential outperformance relative to bitcoin.
