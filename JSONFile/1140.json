Based on interviews, the firm\u2019s researchers have concluded that \u201Cmany of these payments are in fact commercial transactions between Asia-based exporters and Latin American businesses buying goods from them to sell retail at home.\u201D In many cases, it\u2019s to avoid the cost and headache of dealing with local banks while skirting import taxes.","The team was surprised to learn how common this crypto-denominated commerce is, \u201Cand how everyone we talked to kind of knew about it,\u201D said Chainalysis\u2019s head of research Kim Grauer. \u201CWe\u2019re seeing this commercial market develop between regions and it kind mirrors the real economy.\u201D"],"hashtag":[]}
