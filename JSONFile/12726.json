It has been in the works, in a way, since Ethereum first went live in 2015. When it takes place, it will move Ethereum to a proof-of-stake blockchain, reducing its environmental impact and changing some of its tokenomics.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Here\u2019s what you need to know.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The main purpose of The Merge is to transition Ethereum\u2019s consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake model.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Proof of work means the network is secured by miners, using electricity in exchange for block issuance and a portion of transaction fees. Proof of stake secures the network through validators who stake ether in order to validate the network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To prepare for this transition, Ethereum developers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/86179\/eth2-beacon-launch-staking\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/upgrades\/beacon-chain\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Beacon Chain<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in December 2020. This chain functions as a proof-of-stake network running parallel to Ethereum and allows users to stake ether \u2014 which means there is enough ether staked on the network ahead of the switch. The Beacon Chain has about 13.4 million ether staked across thousands of validator nodes.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When The Merge happens, it will bring the current blockchain over and merge it with the proof-of-stake system that\u2019s running in parallel.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The idea of changing a car\u2019s engine from gas to electric, while it's in motion, has become a popular analogy when explaining the Merge. This is in essence what the Ethereum core developers hope to do&nbsp;\u2014 changing the network's mechanics without any downtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the last few months, there has been a lot of testing.

Tomorrow the Paris upgrade will bring the process to completion.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Merge will be triggered once the network reaches Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD), at this point Ethereum will move from proof of work to proof of stake. The figure for the TTD is 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000 and the current estimate for when The Merge will happen can be tracked<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/bordel.wtf\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">here<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Merge will reduce the environmental impact of Ethereum and reduce the issuance of new ether tokens.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Proof of work draws criticism for its negative impact on the climate through excess electricity usage, whereas proof of stake requires less energy consumption as mining becomes obsolete following The Merge. It will reduce the network\u2019s energy consumption by 99.95%, according to the Ethereum Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As a result of the transition there will be fewer new ether tokens issued on a yearly basis. According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/upgrades\/merge\/issuance\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">estimates<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, the rate of new ether creation will drop nearly 90% after the upgrade, due to the fact validator rewards will be significantly smaller than the miner rewards issued on proof of work.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If you account for the amount of ether that gets burned within the transaction fee process, then the network\u2019s net issuance will \u2014 at current activity \u2014&nbsp;drop to near zero. If activity rises, the network could even become deflationary, where less ether is produced each year than is burned.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But The Merge won\u2019t fix all of Ethereum\u2019s woes.
