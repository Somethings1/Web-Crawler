This transparent volume is then divided by the total reported trading volume to derive the transparent volume percentage for the token.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The company ranks 167 cryptocurrency exchanges by how transparent they are with their trading data. Exchanges like Coinbase Pro, Kraken, and Binance can get an A or A+ rating if they share their complete trading history and raw trade data with Nomics. On the contrary, those who get D rating only make their ticker data available, including 24-hour volumes and trading prices, which is what CoinMarketCap mainly tracks, according to Nomics CEO Clay Collins.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although BTC and ETH have relatively low percentages of transparent volumes, Collins explained that this is likely because these cryptocurrencies are widely traded on both high and low rating exchanges. The two coins, in fact, have the two highest raw transparent volumes among the 3,873 tokens Nomics lists on its website. Meanwhile, less popular coins that only trade on a few exchanges, such as Binance's BNB, can outperform BTC and ETH in the percentage index.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CFor assets like BNB, it is traded primarily on Binance and Binance related exchanges. [This] causes a high amount of transparent volumes because it is primarily traded on exchanges that are very transparent,\u201D said Collins.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Collins also notes that tokens with 1% or above transparent volumes are already with the top quartile of all the cryptocurrencies that Nomics is tracking. This \u201Cspeaks to how sad the space is,\u201D said Collins, possibly referring to the opaque trading volumes of some exchanges.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Collins and his team were partly motivated to track these indices by Bitwise\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/cbovaird\/2019\/03\/22\/95-of-reported-bitcoin-trading-volume-is-fake-says-bitwise\/#310393be6717\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">highly-cited report in March<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, which states that 95% of the bitcoin trading volumes are fake.
