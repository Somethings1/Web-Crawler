According to a CryptoQuant analyst, this resulted from short-term holders taking profits made earlier in the week when bitcoin reached a high of $28,500.","CryptoQuant Analyst Adam Mourad added that long-term <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/254148\/bitcoins-rise-in-september-bodes-well-for-october-price-action-bitfinex-analysts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin<\/a> holders are buying into a recent short-term holder sell-off, creating a support level at $27,100.","\"Supply held by long-term holders stands at 15.6 million bitcoins. In stark contrast, short-term holder supply has dipped to a level not seen since November 2015, with a value of 3.8 million bitcoin,\" Mourad told The Block.","According to Mourad, this increase carries significant implications.","\"These bitcoins found new homes with long-term holders, individuals with a deeper belief in the enduring value of this digital asset,\" he added.","Mourad attributed the recent support above $27,000 as a consequence of the long-term holder cohort's tendency to \"hodl\" and accumulate. The analysis is supported by on-chain data from CryptoQuant, which shows exchange reserves falling this week, suggesting a sentiment to remove assets to cold wallets. The data reveals that almost 12,400 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/253787\/bitcoin-sees-early-october-gains-as-it-rises-above-28000\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin<\/a> have been removed from cryptocurrency exchanges since the beginning of this week.","The analyst suggested that the short-term holder profit and loss on-chain metric reveals that this cohort sold mostly at profit at the beginning of the week.","\"Short-term holders have chosen to take advantage of bitcoin's upward momentum, particularly the surge to $28,500, seizing the opportunity to either secure profits or limit their losses,\" he added.","The world's largest digital asset by market capitalization is now changing hands for $27,898 <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">at 12:35 p.m. ET, up 1.3% over the past 24 hours, according to <\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinGecko<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
