Investments in crypto assets continue to be subject to significant risk.\"","While Gensler didn't mention any of the proposed ETFs, the timing of his thread on X quickly raised eyebrows in crypto circles as his comments came <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270834\/spot-bitcoin-etf-applicants-file-amended-s-1-forms-in-final-step-toward-approval\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">just hours<\/a> after asset managers including BlackRock, Ark Invest\/21Shares, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie filed amended S-1 forms for their proposed funds in what was widely seen as a final move ahead of possible approval.&nbsp;","After exchanges including Nasdaq, the NYSE and Cboe filed amended 19b-4 forms on Friday, the ball is now in the SEC's court. If those forms are approved, trading can begin once the S-1 forms become \"effective\" in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270765\/heres-how-to-know-if-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-has-been-approved\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">parallel process<\/a>.&nbsp;","A decision is broadly expected in the coming days, in part because of the Jan. 10 deadline for the SEC to respond to the first in the pack of the latest wave of applications, Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Investment and 21Shares. However, some analysts have noted that the SEC has wide-ranging authority in the process and could possibly try and delay a decision again.","Gensler didn't appear to hint one way or another about what he might be thinking.
