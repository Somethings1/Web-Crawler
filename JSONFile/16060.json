(Even Snap, a smaller fish in the pond, is valued at $20 billion, a figure that dwarfs all but the largest cryptocurrency networks.)","The analogy offers a sharp retort to the criticisms that bitcoin and other blockchains can\u2019t possibly sustain or justify their current valuations, or achieve market capitalizations that exceed what we observe today in more \"rational\" times.","A useful question here is, if all social networks are created equal, using pretty much the same combination of technologies, how can they produce so much value?","After all, according to crypto critics, there\u2019s no reason to have so many coins when they\u2019re all using the same basic building blocks. Here in the market, however, we have an example of an almost wholly contrary outcome.","What might be most remarkable is that these naysayers, if they were to look closely at their phones, would uncover a swath of apps \u2013 SMS, Telegram, Signal, Slack, Skype, etc \u2013 all of which offer, in the grand scheme of things, what amount to slight variations on the same communications experience.","Put simply, it would seem, there\u2019s a big market for \u201Cfeatures,\u201D or slight variations on popular tools, at least when the primary product is a mode of expression.","It follows that all of these social networks have different valuations for at least two reasons \u2013 the unique and different make-ups of their user bases and the variety of specific ways they offer users to communicate across the globe.","You might use Snapchat if you want to send a picture, WeChat if you wanted to talk to someone in Asia, or Signal if you wanted a truly encrypted, private experience.","In this case, you can think of the end user base as a form of liquidity and the features as the rules by which those interactions are governed. Some, like Twitter, might produce more casual relationships, while others, like Facebook, could be more familial.","Still, each network unlocks value in offering unique access to a certain kind of contact. The message is the same in each, the same mix of characters, emoticons and images.","What\u2019s different is the network, how it\u2019s valued by the users, and how they use it.","It would seem, then, that a similar argument could be applied to money and asset ownership by virtue of the new protocols that enable their expression \u2013 blockchains and cryptocurrencies.","Here, it\u2019s helpful to think of what a starkly different environment today\u2019s messaging protocols offer when compared to say, Bell Atlantic, or another long-forgotten phone company. Cherry-picking a somewhat random and self-serving example from a Google search, Bell Atlantic was valued at $125 billion at the time it was the largest local phone company the U.S.","My hunch is if you examined that data, you'd find all the market capitalizations of large telecos don't add up directly to those of communications companies today.","The implication is that internet protocols didn\u2019t merely shift the value already created by communication, they unlocked more of it than was ever thought possible. Armed with the ability to communicate in infinitesimally small interactions (poke Zuck, anyone?) users appear to want to exercise that power and create new value streams.","Applied to blockchains, why couldn\u2019t similar variations unlock similarly massive amounts of value?","I\u2019d say the Telegram ICO is starting to make a bit more sense."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bell Atlantic","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Telegram ICO","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zuck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mark Zuckerberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Telegram","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Cambridge Analytica","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$125 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Pete Rizzo","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$20 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$500 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"China","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Skype","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Bubble","Facebook","WhatsApp","Bitcoin","Snapchat","Markets","cryptocurrencies","Features","Markets News"],"authors":["Pete Rizzo"]}
