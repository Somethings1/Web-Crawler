Future FIFA digital collectible launches will also utilize Polygon, the statement said.","When FIFA first announced \"FIFA+ Collect\" last year, it was billed as offering \"football fans around the world with the chance to affordably own unique digital collectibles.\" The NFT drop comes as the FIFA Club World Cup 2023 is set to kick off tomorrow in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;","While NFT trading volumes have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/265883\/blur-dominates-almost-80-of-nft-trading-volume-as-market-activity-spikes\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rebounded<\/a> recently, levels are still far below where they were during the last bull run when PFP non-fungible tokens from top-tier collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club sometimes sold for millions of dollars. Big brands, however, have continued to pursue opportunities to service and monetize super fans with digital collectible initiatives.","FIFA also announced that Modex will be taking over \"strategic management\" of its digital collectible platform, which has already dropped several football-branded collections. \"Digital collectibles increase the ways in which fans can interact with their favorite players, teams, and the game they love, and we're honored to support FIFA on realizing this goal,\" Modex CEO Francesco Abbate said in a statement.","Using professional sports as an avenue to connect with consumers has been employed by various companies operating in the blockchain and crypto space.
