Toomey claims that he owned 135 XRP in November 2020 (worth about $100 at the time) and sold it in two transactions in December 2020 at a loss of about 50%.","To be sure, that is a negligible amount, but since the lawsuit is class-action, other similarly situated XRP investors in Florida could join Toomey in the case. \"Plaintiff seeks to represent a class defined as all persons or entities in the State of Florida who purchased XRP,\" the lawsuit states.","The Block has reached out to Ripple for comments and will update this story should we hear back.","This is not the first time the defendants are facing a class-action lawsuit. In 2018, investor Vladi Zakinov <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/another-investor-lawsuit-claims-xrp-security\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> a case in California alleging that XRP is a security controlled by Ripple.

The agency said it views XRP as a security and alleged that the defendants engaged in unregistered securities sales.&nbsp;","Ripple has maintained that XRP is not a security and has vowed to fight the SEC charges. Ripple and the SEC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/90437\/ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-questions-sec-lawsuit-twitter\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">are set to meet<\/a> for a pretrial conference on February 22.
