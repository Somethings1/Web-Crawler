The queue represents more than 510,000 ether ($1.1 billion), with a maximum validator stake of 32 ether per validator.","The processing time for completing the exit queue will be five days, with a total withdrawal length of more than 14 days.","This comes as Celsius, going through restructuring after filing for bankruptcy protection last year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231051\/celsius-moves-to-unstake-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-eth\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shared<\/a> its plans to cancel its stake in the Ethereum network \u2014 intending to distribute assets to its creditors.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/ethereum\/ethereum-validator-queue\/embed\" title=\"Ethereum Validator Queue\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Celsius\u2019 withdrawal request of more than 200,000 ETH ($450 million) has contributed to the heightened validator exit queue.

Earlier in June, when Celsius redeemed 428k stETH from Lido, it re-staked 197k ETH via Figment,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tomwanhh\/status\/1743219185986023839\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wan said<\/a>.
