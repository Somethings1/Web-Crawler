Meta's dominance is followed by ByteDance's Pico, which operates within China. Pico captures 4.5% of the overall VR headset market, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.idc.com\/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS49422922\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a>.&nbsp;","\"Meta continues to pour dollars into developing the metaverse but the strategy of promoting low-cost hardware at the expense of profitability isn't sustainable in the long run,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC's mobility and consumer device trackers, in the report.&nbsp;&nbsp;","In June, Meta's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg showcased VR prototypes during a demonstration, all of which are not yet available for sale. Meta, which has made a $10 billion bet on virtual and augmented reality, is developing technology so realistic that users feel like they're in the same room as other virtual people, said Zuckerberg in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IMpWH6vDZ8E\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the presentation<\/a>.
