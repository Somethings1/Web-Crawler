The court has also asked Vauld to form a creditors committee, they added.","Vauld had been seeking a six-month extension under a moratorium application <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/158647\/crypto-lender-vauld-owes-363-million-to-retail-investors-after-halting-withdrawals\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> on July 8. The three-month extension means disgruntled creditors of Vauld cannot commence or continue any legal proceedings against the company while it explores its restructuring options. Client funds remain stuck until Vauld reaches a restructuring deal, including its potential acquisition by rival Nexo.","Vauld did not respond to The Block's request for comment by press time.","Vauld halted client withdrawals on July 4 after facing financial difficulties caused by TerraUSD's (UST's) implosion and the broader crypto market downturn. The firm, based in Singapore with most of its team in India, owes a total of $402 million to its creditors. Of that sum, $363 million \u2014 or 90% \u2014 comes from individual retail investors' deposits.","The moratorium extension had support from many of Vauld's creditors. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/159802\/vauld-crypto-second-affidavit-hostile-action-creditors\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As The Block reported last week<\/a>, from the total of around 147,000 creditors, 2,910 responded to its moratorium application, with 2,280 (approximately 78%) indicating that they are in support of the extension.","London-based Nexo is currently exclusively conducting due diligence on Vauld. It started the process on July 5 and has until September 5 to reach a decision on whether to bail out Vauld.","If Nexo decides to not make a deal with Vauld, the latter could take other paths it has previously highlighted. These include raising more venture capital, converting debt to equity, issuing its own token and developing a payment plan tied to future revenue."],"hashtag":[]}
