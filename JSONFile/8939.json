Momentum appears to be building towards the launch of Worldcoin\u2019s token, which it has said previously will go live in the first half of this year. Users can claim their share of the coin by getting scanned by a Worldcoin orb.","Even in testing, the app has accrued 1.5 million users and logs 60,000 transactions on a typical day, the company said. Users can deposit and withdraw funds using bank accounts or local payment tools and can send money to phone contacts or crypto addresses.","\u201CIt\u2019s already the fastest growing wallet in the world. Today every 14 seconds a person signs up to app,\u201D said Tiago Sada, Head of Product, Engineering and Design at Tools For Humanity.","The World app, which had been in testing in a small number of locations, is now available for download in over 80 countries. It employs a minimalist design \u201Cwith only the essential functionalities of the Worldcoin and Ethereum ecosystems,\u201D according to the announcement.","TFH has also tried to simplify the product by offering \u201Cgas-free transactions,\u201D which it can do by covering the gas fees. The company said the app is \u201Cengineered to maximize inclusivity.\u201D It is available on iOS and Android, is around 18MB in size, is localized to multiple languages and can be supported by phones over 10 years old. &nbsp;","\u201CEverything at Worldcoin is about inclusivity,\u201D Sada said, adding there is \u201Cpotential\u201D to introduce fees in the form of a few basis points for each transaction down the line.","A who\u2019s who of crypto firms, projects and tools power the app\u2019s back end \u2014 including Uniswap for exchange tokens, ENS usernames that can be used to direct transfers, and Ramp and MoonPay for on and off-ramps. The beta version ran on Polygon, but the full version will be based on an Ethereum rollup, per the announcement.","\u201CThe other super interesting thing about the app is just thinking about what all of these financial and identity primitives together allow you to do,\u201D Sada said.","Worldcoin is valued at $3 billion after reportedly raising $100 million from Khosla Ventures and a16z in March 2022. The Block revealed in February that the company is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210014\/sam-altman-worldcoin-fundraise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">seeking another round of funding<\/a> at the same valuation.","Â© 2023 The Block.
