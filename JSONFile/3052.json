That fundamental shift reshaped US equity markets, ushering in an era dominated by Wall Street Bets, meme stocks, and cryptocurrency. Indeed, retail trading has yet to subside even as economies reopen. Monthly net purchases of US equities by individual investors have stabilized at around $20 billion\u2014a surge from the pre-pandemic norm of about $5 billion.&nbsp;","On this episode of The Scoop, eToro's newly-appointed US lead Lule Demmissie explained why she doesn't see retail's newfound presence in the market subsiding anytime soon, and how eToro plans to capitalize on growing its business related to cryptocurrencies and stock trading.","\"What you're seeing is the sustainability of that user base staying engaged, waiting for dips, getting in the markets when necessary,\" said Demmissie, former Ally Invest president and TD Ameritrade managing director.","\"Ultimately they're sticking around and they're engaging every time there's volatility,\" she added.&nbsp;","Demmissie said that the collective mind of the retail crowd could have more insight than institutions previously may have thought.","\"<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I'm originally from Ethiopia, right?
