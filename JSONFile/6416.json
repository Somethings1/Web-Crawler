This is bizarre,\" <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/laurashin\/status\/1516036447849046016\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> journalist Laura Shin, who appears to be just one of the dozens of users on the receiving end of the spam messages.","Justin Mezzell, a co-founder of Proof Collective, the group behind the Moonbirds collection, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JustinMezzell\/status\/1516036459626696715\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> Monday morning that \u201Cthese are scammers who purchase verified accounts\" and pretend to be involved with the Moonbirds project.","It\u2019s unclear if all the scam accounts are hacked accounts of actual verified users or if the verification status is purchased. Twitter did not address this question when contacted by The Block.","In one instance, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s son <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Celentra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Levi Sanders\u2019s account<\/a> appeared to be hijacked, with the account name changed to \u201CMoonbirds.\u201D The hijackers of the account then tweeted a link encouraging people to enter a giveaway. What followed were dozens of other tweets from the account that tagged Twitter users.&nbsp;","&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Screenshot of Levi Sanders's hacked Twitter account<\/span>","Sanders' account appears to have been re-controlled, with the handle changed back to \"Levi Sanders\" and some of the offending messages removed. However, numerous posts tagging numerous users are still available as of the time of writing.&nbsp;","The scams follow the same pattern as other recent NFT-related scams on Twitter. Just last week, Twitter users were <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Yennkhai\/status\/1514274909664395267\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raising alarms<\/a> about verified accounts that were tagging users to click on a fake free NFT airdrop link for Azuki, an NFT collection of 10,000 avatars.","Last month, scammers used verified Twitter accounts to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/takenstheorem\/status\/1507183344915816453\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">steal a reported $1 million<\/a> in a fake ApeCoin airdrop.
