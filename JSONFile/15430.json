Such a database mitigates the risk of a thinly distributed network of nodes, which can result in a network attack such as a 51% attack.","\u201CWe are delighted to support the work of Professor Alvisi\u2019s students as they not only research novel blockchain systems but also develop real-world, scalable use cases and applications to benefit the future of the industry,\" said Aptos Labs Chief Technology Officer and co-founder Avery Ching.","The company also said Stanford University Professor of Computer Science Dr. Dan Boneh has joined as an adviser. Stanford ranked third in the U.S. in the CoinDesk study; the top spot was taken by University of California-Berkeley.","Aptos' grant follows in the footsteps of Cardano, which funded a $4.5 million research hub at Edinburgh University in November.","The aptos token (APT), which was airdropped to early users in October, was one of the top performing crypto assets in January, surging from a low of $3.52 to a high of $20.32. It currently trades at $16.36, according to CoinDesk data. Whilst sentiment remains positive on the whole, concerns have been raised over tokenomics and the lack of activity on the network in comparison to layer 1 competitors such as Ethereum.","Currently, Aptos has $61.45 million in total value locked (TVL) on its network comparec to its market cap of $2.6 billion.","Aptos CEO Mo Shaikh defended the project's token distribution in November, claiming that it is \"much fairer\" than its competitors.","UPDATE (Feb. 1, 16:03 UTC): Adds CoinDesk university rankings in second, fourth paragraphs."],"entity":[{"type":"Mo Shaikh","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Feb. 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$50,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$3.52","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Edinburgh University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alvisi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Aptos","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Lorenzo Alvisi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$16.36","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Dan Boneh","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Berkeley","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"University of California","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$20.32","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Stanford University Professor of Computer Science","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$4.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Cornell University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"51%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Cardano","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aptos Labs Chief Technology Officer","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Avery Ching","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$2.6 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$61.45 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Aptos","Aptos Labs","Education","grant"],"authors":["Oliver Knight"]}
