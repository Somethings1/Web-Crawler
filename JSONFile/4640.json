Since then, it has eliminated about $250 million in secured debt through the sale of assets, including all of its operating sites.","For instance, it sold its 50% share in a 280-megawatt wind power facility in Texas to US Bitcoin Corp, which recently announced a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/209265\/bitcoin-miners-hut-8-and-us-bitcoin-merge-to-form-new-us-based-entity\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">merger with miner Hut 8<\/a>.

The company agreed to a settlement, stipulating it would \"be allowed as a single general unsecured claim of Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. against debtor Compute North LLC in the amount of $40,000,000.00.\"","Core Scientific, the largest company in the mining space by hashrate, also filed for bankruptcy in December but has essentially gone the opposite route, securing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/207253\/judge-approves-core-scientifics-70-million-loan-from-b-riley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">additional financing<\/a> to keep operations going.","However, it did recently agree to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/208323\/core-scientific-cuts-deal-with-lender-nydig-to-extinguish-38-6-million-in-debt\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hand over 27,403 machines<\/a> to lender NYDIG in order to pay down its outstanding debt of $38.6 million, while also stating it was \"considering opportunities to sell certain of their mining facilities,\" according to a filling from Feb. 2.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
