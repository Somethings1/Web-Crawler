Miners use sophisticated computers, known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), to solve complex computational math problems as part of Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus algorithm.","With frequent electricity blackouts, Venezuelan authorities have been cracking down on such facilities, with the country's temporary ban on mining cryptocurrencies effectively killing the industry that had once been promoted in the country, Bloomberg Línea <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberglinea.com\/english\/with-a-ban-on-crypto-mining-venezuela-is-killing-an-industry-it-once-promoted\/#:~:text=The%20intelligence%20police%2C%20known%20as,asked%20not%20to%20be%20named.\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> in June.","Venezuelan regulators initially imposed a ban on cryptocurrency mining in March, following a probe into an alleged corruption scheme where crypto wallets were reportedly used to divert funds from state-owned oil firm PDVSA.","In 2019, President Nicolas Maduro <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/47913\/venezuela-to-back-its-petro-crypto-with-30m-barrels-of-oil-as-opposed-to-5b-barrels-planned-earlier\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> plans to back its national cryptocurrency, the petro, with barrels of oil.","Interior and Justice Minister Remigio Ceballos said four prison guards were arrested, suspected of aiding the gang members who enjoyed a lavish lifestyle behind bars. The government evacuated its 1,600 inmates to other locations, though some managed to escape during the raid, AFP said.&nbsp;","The prison's facilities, installed by the gang, included a restaurant, pool, gambling rooms, disco, baseball field and even a zoo. Some inmates\u2019 partners also lived there and were evicted during the operation.","It wasn\u2019t all fun and games, however, with gang leaders keeping other prisoners in \"a kind of slavery,\" Ceballos said.","The hoard of seized goods also included sniper rifles, explosives, rocket launchers, bullets, machine gun ammunition belts and grenades, Ceballos added.","© 2023 The Block.
