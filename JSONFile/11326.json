The move sent two related tokens crashing.&nbsp;","\"We recently made the decision to sunset the Community Points beta, including Special Memberships, by Nov. 8. At that point, you'll also no longer see Points in your Reddit Vault nor earn any more Points in your communities. Though we saw some future opportunities for Community Points, there was no path to scale it broadly across the platform,\" Reddit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/17a33ql\/serious_sunsetting_community_points_beta_and\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a> in a message on its platform yesterday.","The decision was also attributed to regulatory issues. \"The regulatory environment has added to scalability limitations. Though the moderators and communities that supported Community Points have been incredible partners, as it's evolved, the product is no longer set up to scale,\" Reddit added.","In August, Kraken <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrencyMoons\/comments\/15krl28\/reddit_moons_and_bricks_soar_after_kraken_listing\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">listed<\/a> two Reddit community reward tokens, MOON and BRICK, causing them to soar in price.

It shouldn't just be that Reddit destroys the value of the holdings while offering nothing in return.\"","Launched in 2020, Community Points were introduced to reward Reddit users for activity on the platform, such as receiving significant upvotes on comments or posts. The aim was to boost user engagement and strengthen communities.","The points users earned were Ethereum-compatible ERC-20 tokens stored in Reddit's crypto wallet, Reddit Vault, which could be spent on perks like emojis or badges.
