Unlike proof of work, which relies on miners to validate transactions and secure the network, proof of stake involves validators holding a stake in the network and earning yield in ether for their support.","CoinFund, a crypto investment firm, is attempting to standardize the yield model to create a new benchmark yield rate for Web3.","In this episode, CoinFund President Chris Perkins explains how CoinFund's new Composite Ethereum Staking Rate ('CESR') aims to provide investors with a clear and comparable metric that can serve as the foundation for new financial products for the crypto space such as basis swaps and the development of a forward curve tied to Ethereum's interest rate.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsor <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cleanspark.com\/theblock\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CleanSpark<\/a>.<\/i><\/b><\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">About CleanSpark<\/strong>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner™.
