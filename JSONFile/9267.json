This is separate from the $400 million that the Securities Commission of the Bahamas ordered to be transferred, though the two events happened around the same time.","The FTX hacking incident first became public knowledge in November when the exchange\u2019s official Telegram admins <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186289\/ftx-claims-it-has-been-hacked-of-all-of-its-funds-website-and-mobile-app-compromised\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that there had been \u201Cunauthorized access.\u201D The amount lost is estimated at over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186279\/over-400m-worth-of-tokens-ftx-funds-drained-from-company-accounts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$400 million<\/a>, per on-chain data cited by analytics firm Chainalysis.","The Justice Department is now investigating the case to uncover who was responsible for the breach.

It is unclear at this time if any suspects have yet been identified.","At one point, the wallet address connected with the hacker held the stolen funds in ether alone belonging to FTX reserves, some of which were sold off for bitcoin and could not be recovered.","There was some confusion regarding the FTX hack and another transfer of $400 million in crypto assets from the exchange to The Bahamian regulators. The two events happened close to each other, leading media outlets to mistakenly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/supposed-477-million-ftx-hack-was-actually-a-bahamian-government-asset-seizure-11668782216\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a> that the hack was an asset seizure. That wasn't the case.","What actually happened is that the Securities Commission of the Bahamas ordered a transfer of $400 million from FTX as part of a safekeeping procedure, and while this did occur shortly after the hack took place, it was not connected in any way.","New FTX CEO John J. Ray III <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=J1JPc9Fjf9k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">testified<\/a> that the hack and another large asset transfer ordered by the Bahamian regulators were separate. This is verified by analytics firm Chainalysis.","\u201CThe $400 million stolen and hacked from FTX is completely separate from the $400 million held by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas. It's totally understandable that people were confused by this, though,\u201D a spokesperson from Chainalysis told The Block.","Ray also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194706\/ftx-stored-private-keys-without-encryption-the-exchanges-new-chief-said\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">revealed<\/a> in a prepared testimony <a href=\"https:\/\/financialservices.house.gov\/uploadedfiles\/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-rayj-20221213.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">document<\/a> that FTX stored private keys to its wallets in an unencrypted manner, and had adopted very poor security controls \u2014 factors that could have easily allowed the hack to have taken place.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
