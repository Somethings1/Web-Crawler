The president said that the amount of funds in this trust, known as FIDEBITCOIN, is established in dollars by law. The trust\u2019s balance sheet includes both dollars and bitcoin. Chivo, the state company that operates the trust, must settle that amount in dollars to El Salvador\u2019s development bank Bandesal. Chivo is also the name of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/118348\/a-whos-who-behind-el-salvadors-chivo-bitcoin-wallet-project\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">commission-free wallet app<\/a> that Salvadorans are using to send remittances and make digital payments to businesses, both in dollars and bitcoin.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Bukele, the trust now has a $4 million surplus. Chivo can get rid of those millions without affecting the total amount in the trust, which keeps the same quantity of bitcoin even when the U.S. dollar amount goes down.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CBy the way, we\u2019re not selling any BTC, [we are] using the USD part of the trust, since the BTC part is now worth more than when the trust was established,\u201D Bukele followed up in an English-language tweet.
