This cryptocurrency is an evolution of MATIC and aims to align with the architecture of the upcoming Polygon 2.0 upgrade.","Several key proposals were on the table: PIP-17, which initiates the POL cryptocurrency upgrade, and PIP-19, which recommends the adoption of POL as Polygon\u2019s proof-of-stake native gas and staking coin. As a result, POL will serve as the main cryptocurrency for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/237088\/polygon-2-0-to-leverage-matic-re-staking-and-new-interoperability-layer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polygon 2.0 ecosystem<\/a>, supporting an ecosystem of zero-knowledge-based Layer 2 chains and incorporating features such as staking, community ownership and governance.","\u201CPOL, a next-generation hyperproductive token, will power a vast ecosystem of zero knowledge-based Layer 2 chains via a native re-staking protocol that allows POL holders to validate multiple chains and perform multiple roles on each of those chains,\u201D said Polygon Labs in a statement.","Although the POL token has been deployed on the mainnet, it will not immediately replace MATIC. Such a replacement requires governance approval and will be synchronized with the rollout of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade.","The final upgrade involves several steps: launching a new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/237088\/polygon-2-0-to-leverage-matic-re-staking-and-new-interoperability-layer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">staking layer<\/a> to fuel Polygon Layer 2 chains, transitioning Polygon proof-of-stake to zkRollup, and implementing a ZK-powered interoperability and shared liquidity protocol for all the Layer 2s, according to Polygon Labs.","Â© 2023 The Block.
