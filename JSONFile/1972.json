Indeed, the governance token tied to the protocol, YFI, has surged beyond $30,000 since its inception at the beginning of the summer.&nbsp;","If it was up to Andre, however, he wouldn't be affiliated with the protocol as much as he is. Cronje is currently trying to expand the number of folks responsible for shepherding the protocol.","In the most recent episode of The Scoop, he explained why a proper decentralized protocol doesn't need a decision-maker or figurehead, and discussed yearn's planned transition to a more decentralized model in which multi-sig holders would approve strategies.&nbsp;","\"We haven't fully transitioned yet,\" he said. Still, he said: \"I disagree with this idea that people have that I am yearn because it doesn't need me. If I were to have a heart attack on this call now, it's going to continue without me.\"","We also discuss:&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
