The Department added an Ethereum address to its sanctions list, allegedly tied to the Ronin exploit, and Tornado Cash has now blocked this address.","Chainalysis <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x40c57923924b5c5c5455c48d93317139addac8fb\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">created<\/a> a contract to block sanctioned addresses over a month ago. Thus far, the contract has created three transactions to block a total of 24 addresses. The Ronin exploit-tied address was added on Thursday. Tornado Cash uses this contract to check whether an address is sanctioned.","Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Semenov said that the changes are made only at the frontend, i.e., at its decentralized application (dapp) level. \"The smart contracts are immutable,\" Semenov said in a tweet on Friday. \"The protocol (onchain smart contracts) and the frontend (dapp) are different things.\"","In other words, he meant Tornado Cash itself cannot be shut by sanctions.","Last year, decentralized protocols Uniswap and 1inch also blocked some services from their frontend.

All they have to do is send their crypto to other non-sanctioned addresses and still use Tornado Cash, according to them.&nbsp;","Tornado Cash declined to comment on The Block's queries for this story.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This report's headline has been updated for clarity.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
