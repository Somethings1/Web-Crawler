OKX didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the deal's valuation.","\u201CWe are very proud to have OKX represented on the sleeve of the Manchester City shirt,\" City Football Group CEO Ferran Soriano said in the statement. \u201CWe have already seen great web3 experiences designed by OKX for Manchester City\u2019s global fan base and there will be many more to come.\u201D&nbsp;","City Football Group (CFG) is a British-based holding company that owns Manchester City and other soccer teams including New York City FC and Melbourne City FC. CFG is majority owned by Newton Investment and Development LLC, a company registered in Abu Dhabi, wholly owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan.","The Premier League side pulled off a treble-winning season in 2022\/2023 for the first time in its history, emulating the feat of city rivals Manchester United in 1998\/1999. Under coach Pep Guardiola, the club picked up the English Premier League and FA Cup titles, as well as the European Champions League trophy.","OKX was first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.okx.com\/learn\/man-city-okx-partnership\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> as Manchester City\u2019s official cryptocurrency exchange partner in March 2022. Then, in July of that year, OKX <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/156841\/okx-inks-training-kit-sponsorship-deal-with-manchester-city\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">inked<\/a> a sponsorship deal with the club to emblazon its logo on the front of Manchester City\u2019s training kit during the 2022\/2023 season. City AM <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cityam.com\/manchester-city-sign-up-crypto-app-okx-as-training-kit-partner-in-eight-figure-deal\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> that deal was worth more than $12 million at the time.&nbsp;","Last year\u2019s deal also saw OKX become a presenting partner for City\u2019s 2022 trophy tour. OKX commissioned street artist Akse P19 and Global Street Art Agency to create murals featuring Manchester City players Erling Haaland, Jack Grealish, Joao Cancelo and John Stones across the city.","In February, OKX and Manchester City players Jack Grealish, Rúben Dias, Ilkay Gündoğan and Alex Greenwood <a href=\"https:\/\/www.okx.com\/learn\/manchester-city-okx-collective\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> the \u201COKX Collective,\u201D an \u201Cimmersive metaverse fan experience\u201D offering fans access to exclusive content and rewards.","\u201CManchester City was our first official global brand partnership and in just a year and a half we have come a long way,\u201D OKX CMO Haider Rafique said. \u201CWe always intended to integrate with the sport and help the club lead on leaning into web3. Fast forward fifteen months, we now have a metaverse, an NFT initiative and a number of other new projects that we are excited about. The sleeve partnership brings us closer to City fans across the globe.\u201D","OKX also has partnerships with other sports brands and athletes including McLaren Formula 1, The Tribeca Festival, Olympian Scotty James and F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo.","The sale of crypto derivatives, a product offered by OKX, was effectively <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/article\/80943\/crypto-derivatives-uk-ban-defi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">banned<\/a> by the UK\u2019s financial regulator in January 2021. OKX and other crypto exchanges comply with the rules by not advertising such services in the country. OKX said it considers the partnership with Manchester City for its global fanbase.","Following a collective agreement by Premier League clubs to restrict gambling sponsorships on team shirts, there are also concerns the same thing could happen to deals with crypto companies. The Football Supporters' Association wants the game's authorities to introduce regulatory standards on crypto in football, the UK media outlet Sky Sports <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skysports.com\/football\/news\/11095\/12856367\/premier-league-clubs-agree-to-withdraw-gambling-sponsorships-on-front-of-shirts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> in April. However, with the new gambling sponsorship changes not coming in until the 2026\/2027 soccer season, any similar move for crypto sponsorships could be some years away.","© 2023 The Block.
