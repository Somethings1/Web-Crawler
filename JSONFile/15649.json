Those holding over 100 ETH balances will earn just 0.2 percent APY.","Some BTC balances, on the other hand, will see a slight interest rate increase \u2013 up to 2.15 percent from the current 2 percent \u2013 for deposits of over 25 BTC. Those holding 0.5\u201325 BTC will continue to earn 6.2 percent APY, BlockFi said.","The firm cited the reason for the increased interest rate on larger BTC deposits as being because borrowing and lending markets for the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization \u201Chave developed into a vibrant and growing field.\u201D","On the contrary, the ether lending market has become \"stagnant\" over the last couple quarters, BlockFi said. The firm's terms and conditions state that it can change interest rates at its discretion.","The company launched the BIA in March, offering an annual interest rate of 6 percent, paid on a monthly basis in cryptocurrency. That monthly interest is then compounded to produce a 6.2 percent APY.","BIA crypto holdings are custodied at the Gemini Trust Company, which is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services and also offers insurance coverage for the digital assets it holds in custody.","In Tuesday\u2019s update, BlockFi further updated that the BIA now has over $100 million in assets under management \u2013 almost double the $53 million it had as of last month.","BlockFi is backed by notable investors including Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital Ventures and Anthony Pompliano\u2019s Morgan Creek Digital. The firm raised $4 million last December, and previously raised $52.5 million last July.","BlockFi image via CoinDesk archives"],"entity":[{"type":"June 1","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Anthony Pompliano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York Department of Financial Services","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Morgan Creek Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$100 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$4 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"3.25 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$52.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$53 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"6 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"last month","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Mike Novogratz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"0.2 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2.15 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Gemini Trust Company","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Galaxy Digital Ventures","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"6.2 percent","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BIA","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Bitcoin","News","BlockFi","Interest-Bearing Accounts","business news"],"authors":["Yogita Khatri"]}
