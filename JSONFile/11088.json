The team has disabled deposits to all public DeFi vaults while ensuring that withdrawals remain active for users needing to access their funds.","\"Our vaults will continue to be managed normally for now, but deposits are currently shut down until we identify and mitigate the problem,\" the team <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GammaStrategies\/status\/1742839968240980408\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>.&nbsp;","Security firms PeckShield and BlockSec both told The Block the incident resulted in estimated losses of $3.4 million, with the hacker taking over 1500 ether. BlockSec\u2019s analysis points to a critical vulnerability in the protocol's \"accounting mechanism.\"","The attacker manipulated the prices of specific liquid staking tokens and stablecoin vaults, enabling the creation of an excessive amount of LP tokens.","\u201CThe root cause stems from the inconsistency between the accounting mechanisms for depositing and withdrawing used by Gamma Strategies, which results in a discrepancy between the liquidity and the shares,\u201D BlockSec founder Yajin Zhou told The Block. \u201CExploiting this, the attacker could withdraw an excessive amount of tokens.\u201D","Gamma Strategies is a decentralized asset management protocol built on Ethereum and other blockchains.
