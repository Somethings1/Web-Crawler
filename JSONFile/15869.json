But there\u2019s no slowing down in the race among technologists to position for the future. In the past week MakerDAO\u2019s Rune Christensen, a pioneer of decentralized finance, signaled his openness to abandon the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem for rival technology from Solana or Cosmos, as the project searches for its own dedicated blockchain. Separately, a debate broke out over whether Ethereum should have its own \u201CSupreme Court\u201D to arbitrate disputes.","This week\u2019s feature focuses on blockchain \u201Csequencers\u201D \u2013 a crucial element of the fast-growing infrastructure for \u201Clayer-2\u201D networks atop Ethereum. Sequencers have been in the headlines recently, partly because they\u2019re sometimes cast as single points of failure that could undermine the design principle of decentralization. Our Sam Kessler explains.","You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk\u2019s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.","SOLANA SEDUCTION: MakerDAO, one of the oldest and biggest decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols on the Ethereum blockchain, is considering moving to its own dedicated blockchain. And rather than simply start a new layer-2 network within the dominant Ethereum ecosystem \u2013 as crypto-friendly firms like Coinbase and Consensys have chosen to do \u2013 MakerDAO might be looking to decamp altogether. Rune Christensen, MakerDAO\u2019s founder, suggested last week that the project\u2019s best bet might be to clone or \u201Cfork\u201D the Solana blockchain \u2013 since it has the \u201Cmost promising codebase.\u201D In a governance forum post, he said Solana had demonstrated \u201Ctechnical quality\u201D as well as \u201Cresilience by having gone through the FTX blowup.\u201D (Solana was famously promoted by the collapsed FTX crypto exchange\u2019s now-jailed founder, Sam Bankman-Fried.) Christensen went so far as to suggest the Cosmos blockchain\u2019s technology as the \u201Cother main contender.\u201D Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was apparently none too pleased, reportedly raising the question \u2013 in a post on a rival stablecoin project\u2019s Discord channel \u2013 of whether \u201CMakerDAO is torpedoing itself in weird directions\u201D and then selling some 500 of the project\u2019s MKR tokens (worth $579,000) that he had held since 2020. (Separately, in what might be a salt-in-the-wound moment, the credit-card network Visa announced Tuesday that it had expanded its stablecoin settlement capabilities to Solana, in addition to Ethereum.) On Wednesday, Solana Labs co-founder Raj Gokal told CoinDesk TV that the network was \u201Cbattle-tested\u201D and \u201Cready for prime time.\u201D","CODE VS. HUMANS: There\u2019s an oft-repeated mantra in blockchain ideology that \u201Ccode is law\u201D \u2013 the idea that a network\u2019s underlying programming should be sacrosanct, providing the ultimate authority to settle disputes even when serious emergencies or existential threats arise. Now, a top executive in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem is explicitly embracing the idea that, in certain extreme scenarios, humans rather than hard-coding might be the superior arbiters of justice. Alex Gluchowski, CEO of Matter Labs, the developer of a top layer 2 network on Ethereum, has floated the idea of an \u201CEthereum Supreme Court\u201D to arbitrate disputes that escalate to the point of threatening the main blockchain\u2019s integrity. The system, which Gluchowski described on X (formerly Twitter) as \u201Ca hierarchical system of on-chain courts similar to the real-world judiciary,\u201D would allow apps built atop Ethereum to appeal for a chain \u201Cfork\u201D in the event that they are hacked or face some other sort of security crisis. \u201CCode is law, bug = death,\u201D Gluchowski wrote in a follow-up comment to his Sept. 2 post.","BASE\u2019S NEW FANBASE: Just as the Friend.tech fad faded, sapping some of the post-launch adoration of Coinbase\u2019s new Base layer-2 blockchain (as chronicled in last week\u2019s The Protocol), there\u2019s a new kid in town: Aerodrome Finance. The platform, which markets itself as the Base ecosystem\u2019s \u201Cpremiere liquidity engine and hub,\u201D has quickly attracted more than $170 million of TVL or \u201Ctotal value locked,\u201D helping to push the overall TVL of protocols on Base to more than $400 million. The secret? According to the newsletter Wu Blockchain, the project\u2019s \u201Cnative token, $AERO, offers liquidity mining rewards with an annualized yield close to 1,000% without compounding.\u201D That\u2019s a lot, even in crypto. Aerodrome\u2019s TVL has now exceeded \u2013 \u201Cflippened\u201D in crypto jargon \u2013 the $158 million on Velodrome, Aerodome\u2019s predecessor project, which sits on the older layer-2 chain Optimism. Is it sustainable? \u201CMoney doesn\u2019t materialize out of thin air,\u201D Wu Blockchain noted dryly, so \u201Cit\u2019s worth considering when this spiral might come to an end.\u201D (A Base zit: On Tuesday, the network suffered a \u201Cmajor outage\u201D that lasted a little over three hours, its biggest glitch since the launch last month.)","Also:","FIRST ON COINDESK: Coinbase has quietly created a crypto lending service geared toward large investors, helping to fill the void left by last year\u2019s blowups of firms like Genesis and BlockFi.","X, the Elon Musk-owned social media platform formerly called Twitter, has obtained payments licenses from several U.S. states in recent months \u2013 including a currency transmitter license in Rhode Island last week.","MetaMask, the popular crypto wallet, unveiled a new \u201CSell\u201D feature that \u201Callows you to cash out your crypto for fiat currency easily,\u201D in a post on X. The feature is available in the U.S., UK and parts of Europe, \u201Cinitially supporting ETH on Ethereum mainnet, with plans to expand to native gas tokens on layer 2 networks soon,\u201D according to the company. Funds can be sent to a bank account or PayPal balance.","Highlighting blockchain tech upgrades and developments.","Fundraisings","Deals and grants","Data and tokens","Regulatory, Policy and Legal","At least four Ethereum liquid staking providers have agreed to a self-imposed limit where they would never own more than 22% of the Ethereum staking market, Cointelegraph reported, citing the X account superphiz.eth.
