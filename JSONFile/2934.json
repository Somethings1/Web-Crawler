He wanted to sell 90 units of SD8 tokens. The scheme would have allowed him to instantly collect up to $13.5 million off of his $34 million guaranteed three-year contract. Token holders would have then received monthly payments in the next three years with a 4.95% base interest rate. But the NBA was not thrilled with Dinwiddie\u2019s proposal, claiming that the tokenization platform would constitute a breach of the NBA players\u2019 collective-bargaining agreement.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe SD8 offering did not take place at the time.
