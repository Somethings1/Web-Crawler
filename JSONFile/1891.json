Al Green (D-TX), Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee; and U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-MA), Chairman of the Task Force on Financial Technology all addressed their concerns to Zuckerberg, as well as COO Sheryl Sandberg and Calibra CEO David Marcus in an open <a href=\"https:\/\/financialservices.house.gov\/uploadedfiles\/07.02.2019_-_fb_ltr.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter<\/a>.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The letter alleges the Libra system, which set up shop in Switzerland a few months ago, is intended to rival U.S. monetary policy and the dollar.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"This raises serious privacy, trading, national security, and monetary policy concerns for not only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/30333\/india-not-keen-on-allowing-facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook's<\/a> over 2 billion users, but also for investors, consumers, and the broader global economy,\" the lawmakers wrote.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The letter also claims the system could become \"an under-regulated platform for illicit activity and money laundering.\" These concerns arise from the lack of information contained in Libra's white paper, according to the signatories.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As justification for the concerns expressed, the letter makes reference to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the political consulting firm accessed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/32512\/analysis-democrats-more-negative-than-republicans-at-house-hearing-on-facebooks-libra\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Facebook<\/a> user data to influence voting behavior in the 2016 election.
