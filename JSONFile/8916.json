There are now over 1,600 unique addresses who own a set, the company\u2019s CEO Felix Feng told The Block, and around $2 million in its system.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The new social trading platform builds on Set\u2019s existing system. Professional traders can apply to join the platform and charge an entry fee from everyday users who wish to purchase their \u201Csets\u201D.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The platform currently has 10 professional traders \u2013 including Turkish trader Fidelitas Lex, prominent DEX trader CryptoCat, and Wyre CEO Michael Dunworth \u2013 with 20 unique strategies. Feng revealed that the company's goal is to bring on hundreds of professional traders by the end of 2020.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In making these onboarding decisions, Set tries to consider both their trading expertise and their online influence, Feng said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt's really important to onboard really skilled traders,\u201D he said. \u201CWe also try to get an understanding of their following and how big is the community that they can onboard onto Set.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The platform, in essence, is built on the concept of trend trading, which Feng argued will work for at least the next couple years due to the nascent nature of the crypto market. After that, however, the system will have to employ much more sophisticated trading techniques.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C[Crypto] doesn\u2019t have a clear valuation model and there aren\u2019t a large number of institutions who have committed capital into crypto. You can have large whales manipulate the price at the moment,\" he said. \"So I think trend trading is still something that will work for the next few years...But people will get smarter and smarter.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the same time, Feng believes that cryptocurrency trading has always had a social element to it.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCrypto is an inherently social phenomenon that is fragmented across Telegram, Reddit, and Twitter,\u201D he said. \u201CWe\u2019re just formalizing this into a protocol.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In Oct. 2019, Etoro <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/45017\/social-trading-giant-etoro-launches-copytrader-feature-for-crypto-traders-in-us\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> a similar \u201CCopyTrader\u201D feature for amateur traders to copy professionals\u2019 trading strategies.&nbsp;<\/span>","But according to Feng, the U.S. is still relatively behind when it comes to social trading while European countries like Germany and the U.K are leading the field. In fact, the U.K. already has regulations in place to issue licenses to social trading platforms, he said.<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b>\"Social trading taps into a value prop for traders that's really global, which allow them to garner a following without doing all the work of setting up the legal infrastructure,\" he said. \"This is something that we haven't really fully appreciated in the US, but has actually been a budding field in finance for the past decade in places outside of the US, particularly Europe.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
