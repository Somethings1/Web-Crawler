It promised users attractive daily payouts but would require them to deposit at least $500 worth of crypto assets in order to participate.&nbsp;","Between April 6, 2018 and June 27, 2019, the pyramid scheme lured in over 2.6 million members across 3,293 layers, the court said.","During this period, the scheme absorbed more than 314,000 BTC, 117,450 BCH, 96,023 DASH, 11 billion DOGE, 1.84 million LTC, 9 million ETH, 51 million EOS, and 928 million XRP.","At the lowest prices between May 1, 2018 and June 27, 2019, these crypto assets were worth at least more than 14.8 billion yuan, or $2.2 billion, the court said. They would be worth over $11 billion at today's prices.","A total of 15 people have been convicted so far, according to the ruling. They are sentenced to between two to 11 years behind bars with fines between $100,000 to $1 million.","The seized crypto assets aside, the court said one convict had successfully laundered more than 145 million yuan, or $22 million, worth of cryptocurrencies into Chinese yuan.","The police identified the trails of about $19 million of those laundered funds, which were spent by the convicts or their families on purchasing luxury cars, two dozens of real estate properties in China as well as insurance policies in Hong Kong.","The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/85186\/money-laundering-crackdown-china-crypto-otc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> previously that Chinese police have ramped up efforts in recent years cracking down internet-based criminal activities, some of which may have also used cryptocurrency to defraud victims or launder proceeds.","These events have therefore led to a wide bank account freeze issue since this year for China's over-the-counter trading desks and users who are taking collateral damage.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Read the full judgment below:<\/em>","<a title=\"View PlusToken case on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/486033788\/PlusToken-case#from_embed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">PlusToken case<\/a> by <a title=\"View Wolfie Zhao's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/user\/533299069\/Wolfie-Zhao#from_embed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wolfie Zhao<\/a> on Scribd","<iframe id=\"doc_35221\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"PlusToken case\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/486033788\/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-umAAgV9iFvFPum74foBF\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7729220222793488\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>"],"hashtag":[]}
