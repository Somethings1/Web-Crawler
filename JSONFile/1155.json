The current <a href=\"https:\/\/goldprice.org\/gold-price.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">price<\/a> of gold per ounce is around $1,500.","Synthetic trading allows traders to take a short or long position without actually buying or selling an underlying asset. \u201CThe benefit of trading gold (or bitcoin) in a derivative form (synthetically) is that it\u2019s simpler to trade than the cash underlier for a variety of operational reasons, and typically represents the majority of activity in the product\/asset,\u201D said Boonen.","The gold-bitcoin derivative is a result of demand from its clients, said B2C2. \u201CThe clients we are seeing demand from are those who have their own user base of traders and macro hedge funds,\u201D Boonen told The Block, adding that the product is available to \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/www.handbook.fca.org.uk\/handbook\/COBS\/3\/6.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">eligible counterparties<\/a>\u201D and \u201C<a href=\"https:\/\/www.handbook.fca.org.uk\/handbook\/COBS\/3\/5.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">professional clients<\/a>\u201D as defined by the FCA.","Gold has soared in 2019, as investors fear recession and are anxious about the impact of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/38196\/investors-up-their-gold-holdings-for-3rd-consecutive-month-amid-trade-war-risks\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">U.S.-China trade war<\/a>, among other macroeconomic factors such as central bank rate cuts.","\u201CThe current macro environment, dominated by uncertainty over economic growth and inflation, is prompting central banks to rethink monetary policy and market participants to reassess the likely path of interest rates. Conflicting narratives abound, fuelling market activity, and we expect demand to only grow for ways to gain and manage exposure to deflationary assets such as gold and bitcoin,\u201D said Boonen.","Notably, not only bitcoin but the derivative product also allows clients to settle trades in other tokens, including recently-launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/38553\/paxos-embraces-gold-pegged-crypto-as-sea-change-in-gold-trading\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">PAX Gold<\/a> (PAXG), a gold-pegged token by stablecoin issuer Paxos. \u201CWe are agnostic as to which of the major tokens our clients choose to use to settle their trades with us, be it Paxos Gold or another. These tokens will give them access to the underlying metal since they correspond to ownership of physical gold in vaults,\u201D Boonen told The Block.","Looking ahead, B2C2 is planning to launch more products, but only where it has a \u201Cclear edge,\u201D to do, Boonen told The Block, adding: \u201CWe are an electronic market-making firm first and foremost. We expect to continue expanding our offering beyond cryptocurrencies.\u201D B2C2 currently also offers trading in six \u201Clarge-cap\u201D cryptocurrencies - bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP, litecoin (LTC), EOS and bitcoin cash (BCH)."],"hashtag":["DERIVATIVES","XRP"]}
