Bitcoin mining revenue accounted for $189 million (67%) of the total revenue \u2014 up 20% from 2022 \u2014 driven by higher Bitcoin production and the rising price of Bitcoin, the company said.","Riot, which runs North America\u2019s largest Bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas, grew its Bitcoin production by 19% year-over-year from 5,554 BTC in 2022 to 6,626 BTC in 2023, despite <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/249674\/texas-riot-30-million-bitcoin-miners\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">curtailing its power usage<\/a> by over 95% during peak periods of energy demand.","Riot also generated $64.3 million in engineering revenue, $27.3 million from data center hosting revenue and $0.1 million from other services. The revenue was not enough to offset higher expenses in 2023, including an increase in Riot\u2019s mining capacity, headcount and power costs \u2014 leading to a net loss of $49.5 million. Net losses significantly reduced from $509.6 million in 2022, however.","Riot was compensated with $71.2 million in power credits through the support of the ERCOT grid in the state during several weather-related demand surges last year \u2014 equivalent to around 2,497 BTC at average prices.

It also plans to bring additional capacity online at its new Corsicana facility in Texas throughout 2024.
