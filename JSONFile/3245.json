Since then, individual items, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/assets\/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270\/173000647\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Skulptuur #647<\/a>, have been sold on NFT marketplace OpenSea for as much as 90 ether ($261,400).","Yet some buyers were left puzzled when pieces that they believed they had secured during a frenzied mint failed to appear in their wallets.","One would-be buyer pointed out, on Art Blocks\u2019 Discord server, that <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/assets\/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270\/173000445\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Skulptuur #445<\/a> seemed to have been minted by two separate accounts, according to OpenSea\u2019s records. Another said they had spent over $1,400 in gas fees \u2014 costs linked with verifying transactions on the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 only to see someone else claim the piece they believed they had bought.","\u201CI never got the money back but that\u2019s not I want. I want to receive the artwork that I paid for!\u201D they said.","Roughly an hour after the mint, an Art Blocks representative confirmed via Discord that the platform had fallen victim to a \u201Cblock-reorg\u201D \u2014 meaning a temporarily confirmed block of Ethereum transactions had later been replaced by a different block.","This kind of thing may have been just due to how blockchains work (small reorgs happen all the time) or it could have been a user collaborating with a miner to put the transactions in their favor.","\u201CThis is not something that Art Blocks has any control over, this re-org happened at the level of the state of the Ethereum Virtual Machine as a whole,\u201D they said. The representative provided Etherscan links to the affected blocks \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/block\/13308900\/f\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">13308900<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/txs?block=13308901\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">13308901<\/a>. They also suggested that a recently upgraded version of the Art Blocks site should solve this issue in the future.","\u201COn the <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.artblocks.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">new site<\/a> we should be waiting for multiple block confirmations before showing you a success to avoid this bad UX [user experience] of seeing a success that isn\u2019t ultimately true once chain-state finality is achieved. We definitely understand the frustration here and are sorry that the issue exists on the old site,\u201D they added.","Some Art Blocks observers saw the episode as an example of miners on the Ethereum network \u2014 who earn fees in exchange for verifying transactions \u2014 exploiting their position for profit.","EthereumDegen <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ethereumdegen\/status\/1442548323483717637\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> that the reorganization of transaction blocks allow miners to \u201Cget their mints in and earn free money by flipping.\u201D","\u201CIf you aren\u2019t mining blocks your chance to get an Art Blocks mint are reduced and those miners are scalping us,\u201D they added.","Art Blocks was contacted for comment but did not respond by press time.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":[]}
