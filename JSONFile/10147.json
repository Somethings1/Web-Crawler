This blockchain representation works as a certificate that is unique and protected from duplication. What makes NFT unique is the distinguishing information stored within them, and they are indivisible, indestructible, and verifiable.","Generally, NFTs are unrepeated tokens representing art, objects, or even digital content such as a CryptoKitty. Another example of NFTs includes collectibles like baseball cards, pictures, or tweets, among other things.","Non-fungibility is the most crucial element of NFT. When something is fungible, it means that you can exchange an item for one another. For example, if I have a banknote of $100, I can easily trade my original $100 banknote for another as they are not unique. We can also exchange this banknote for a hundred coins, with each coin worth $1.","But, since NFTs are unique and non-fungible, it will not be possible for you to exchange an object with another identical counterpart. That\u2019s because it is impossible to have identical NFTs \u2014 even those that exist on the same platform.","There is no clear answer to that question. However, a possible explanation could relate to being the \u201CFOMO\u201D buying behavior for missing out on the opportunity to be among the first individuals to purchase the world\u2019s most wanted NFTs.","For example, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, sold his first tweet (Twitter\u2019s first tweet) for $2.9 million. The individual who purchased this NFT expects to sell it at a higher price or keep it as a collection.","Everything has an expiry date. While no one can predict what\u2019s in demand in the future, it may still be a good idea to buy and sell NFTs before they explode in value. Just like how Bitcoin was only a decade ago mere pennies in worth, today it has become one of the world\u2019s most demanded digital assets.","However, you should be cautious when purchasing highly-priced NFTs, considering this could be just a part of a bubble.","NFTs became one of the latest trends in the blockchain and crypto markets. Although we might be facing a period of hype, these NFTs could turn out to be something more revolutionary than we expected.","Learn everything about crypto and trading with <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.bybit.com?medium=organic_SEO&amp;source=Learn&amp;channel=org_&amp;campaign=Channel&amp;stage=1&amp;content=theblockcrypto&amp;dtpid=1617103941040&amp;utm_campaign=channel&amp;utm_medium=organic_SEO&amp;utm_source=learn&amp;utm_content=homepage\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Learn.bybit<\/a>","Connect on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/bybit-fintech-limited\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LinkedIn<\/a>","Follow Bybit on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/bybit-fintech-limited\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/a>"],"entity":[{"type":"$2.9 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$60 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$100","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$1","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jack Dorsey","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":[],"authors":["Sponsored","The Block"]}
