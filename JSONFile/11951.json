KuCoin announced an $8.95 million <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kucoin.com\/announcement\/Compensation-for-Withdrawal-Congestion-and-Gratitude-for-Loyalty-Users?utm_campaign=Research%20newsletter&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">airdrop program<\/a> for users who experienced this withdrawal congestion, as well as a larger planned airdrop for users who didn\u2019t withdraw any assets during the period. However, the incentive was not enough to stop KuCoin\u2019s market share more than halving from 6.5% to 3%, per Kaiko data.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KuCoin trade volume and market share.

Some of the outflows may also be attributed to market makers leaving the exchange, the analysts noted.","Outflows from KuCoin-labeled wallets amounted to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284916\/kucoin-sees-nearly-800-million-in-net-outflow-following-doj-indictment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$600 million<\/a> on March 26 alone, significantly outpacing inflows and consisting of mainly ether and USDT. However, the analysts said it was important to note that the flows only included onchain transactions between Kucoin and other exchanges or wallets and not those made between Kucoin addresses.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KuCoin wallet flows.

The indictment claimed KuCoin deliberately avoided U.S. AML and KYC regulations by \"falsely representing that it had no U.S. customers when, in truth, KuCoin had a substantial U.S. customer base.\"","For example, from August 2022 to November 2023, about 197 KuCoin deposit addresses indirectly or directly received $3.2 million worth of crypto from virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash, which has been placed on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247049\/tornado-cashs-semenov-added-to-us-government-sanctions-list\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sanctions<\/a> list, the DOJ said at the time.","\"KuCoin is operating well, and the assets of our users are absolutely safe,\" the exchange responded. \"We are aware of the related reports and are currently investigating the details through our lawyers. KuCoin respects the laws and regulations of various countries and strictly adheres to compliance standards.\"","The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed a parallel civil action on March 26 against KuCoin, alleging it illegally operated a digital asset derivatives exchange. The CFTC is seeking disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans as well as a permanent injunction against future violations.","Despite the DOJ\u2019s claims, Kaiko found no direct interaction between KuCoin and Tornado Cash on the Ethereum blockchain.","However, funds stolen from the exchange following a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/84248\/kucoin-280m-stolen-recovered\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$280 million hack<\/a> in 2020 were subsequently \u201Cprivatized\u201D using the crypto mixer, involving a significant amount of ether, the analysts noted.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stolen ether from KuCoin transferred to Tornado Cash.
