The deal was to create a wealth management behemoth that would administer $1 billion in crypto, superannuation and direct equities investments, for up to one million customers in Australia.","Now, the deal is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.afr.com\/technology\/superhero-and-swyftx-walk-away-from-1-5b-merger-20221220-p5c7nv\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">off<\/a> and the regulatory climate for crypto in Australia is reportedly to blame. AFR quoted Superhero co-founder John Winters as saying that investor sentiment for crypto products had declined in the country. Winters also linked the failure of the merger to the fallout of the recent FTX collapse. The Superhero co-founder added that the firm was turning its attention to \u201Clong-term traditional investments\u201D that had \u201Cmore transparency.\u201D","AFR also quoted sources close to Superhero who offered more context for the collapse of the merger. These sources say Superhero was concerned about Swyftx\u2019s exposure to the Binance crypto exchange. Binance continues to come under scrutiny from regulators, especially in the U.S. where the platform is being investigated for alleged money laundering.","The Block contacted Swyftx, Superhero and Binance for comment but did not hear back before publication time.&nbsp;","The demerger news is the latest business failure for Swyftx.
