And while it tests these murky waters, it may also help establish whether the SEC intends to view ETH as a security.\u201D\n\nPrometheum is able to offer both custody and trading in those digital assets because, unusually, it has licenses to do both. That means it can \u201Clegally sling Ethereum as a security,\u201D in the words of Fortune\u2019s Jeff John Roberts and hope that \u201Cregulators have no choice but to recognize the designation.\u201D In this scenario, Prometheum would then be the only platform for legally trading ether, the security \u2014 a pretty nice natural monopoly if you can get it.\n\nThe question, then, is whether the SEC, witnessing this anomaly, would step in to finally designate ether a security, or not. Mike Selig, a fintech lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, says that\u2019s unlikely, given the SEC\u2019s preference the last few years for not saying anything very definite when it comes to crypto. \u201CThe SEC is likely to remain neutral on Ethereum,\u201D he says. They have done no favors for ether. I wouldn\u2019t expect it makes one now.\u201D Under the terms of the SEC\u2019s special-purpose broker-dealer, Prometheum has broad latitude to designate assets as securities to list on its platform (for instance, by showing that an asset meets the all-important Howey Test).","See also: Coinbase vs. the SEC Debates the Difference Between Securities and Beanie Babies | Opinion\n\nHow this plays out is anyone\u2019s guess. Jeff John Roberts thinks Prometheum will struggle for clients and that Coinbase and others will fight SEC chair on this as it\u2019s fighting on a host of related issues. But the Prometheum Test shows one thing very clearly once again: the SEC has failed to provide any legal certainty for the crypto industry and as a result has enabled a backdoor actor to come within spitting distance of a legal monopoly. Nature abhors a vacuum, and the crypto industry abhors Gary Gensler\u2019s SEC.","Edited by Daniel Kuhn and Jesse Hamilton."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Daniel Kuhn","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mike Selig","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"fintech","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Prometheum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hamilton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gary Gensler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC Debates the Difference Between Securities","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"John Roberts","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jesse Hamilton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Jeff John Roberts","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Willkie Farr & Gallagher","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"the U.S.","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","The Node","Newsletters","Ether","Prometheum","SEC","Securities"],"authors":["Ben Schiller"]}
