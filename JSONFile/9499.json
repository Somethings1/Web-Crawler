Three Arrows Capital's liquidation event resulted in an $80 million loss for BlockFi, which the company described as a small fraction of losses reported by other lending firms.","BlockFi said that the firm has \"no further exposure and the limited losses we did experience will be absorbed by BlockFi.\"","To weather the storm, BlockFi inked a $250 million credit deal with FTX to manage through the crisis on June 22. The firm has also been fielding interest for acquisition from FTX and other market participants.&nbsp;","BlockFi said that the current deal with FTX will allow it to protect customer assets on the platform.&nbsp;","BlockFi's Zac Prince said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BlockFiZac\/status\/1542934038469640192\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/a>.","\"We were presented with various unattractive options where client funds would take a haircut or be behind a lender in the capital stack.
