This system introduces risks and the problem of trust, IGWT Block President Flavio Mansi told The Block, as buyers have to count on the intermediary to correctly judge a phone\u2019s condition and return their money if a quality issue arises.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhy do you necessarily have to trust Amazon?\u201D Mansi asked.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IGWT Block\u2019s proposed platform, on the other hand, will make use of smart contracts to directly connect buyers and sellers, eliminating the need for any middleman.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After a purchase is made, Mansi explained, the money will be stored in a smart contract until the buyer receives the phone, evaluates it using IGWT Block\u2019s diagnosis tool, and makes sure that the product received matches the advertisement.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf anyone is being deceitful in any way, the money reverts back,\u201D Mansi said. \u201CThe smart contract is governing the transaction as opposed to us having to put ourselves in the middle and mediate disputes amongst them,\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As the technology evolves, Manisi said, customers will eventually be able to see images of the exact phone they wish to purchase. This will make information more symmetric and create a more educated buying force.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The model took inspiration from the secondhand car market, Mansi said.
