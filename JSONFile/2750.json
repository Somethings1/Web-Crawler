The President\u2019s Working Group is a joint effort involving the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. However, the Treasury Secretary \u2014 currently Janet Yellen \u2014 chairs the President's Working Group (PWG).&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Given that the PWG\u2019s stablecoin concerns focused on prudential risk \u2014 specifically, whether these tokens are verifiably backed by appropriate funding \u2014 Yellen delegated the report to Liang.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Beyond summarizing the stablecoin market for policymakers, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/122890\/us-treasury-releases-long-awaited-report-on-stablecoin-risk-features-request-for-new-laws\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report made recommendations<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> for more transparency in stablecoin reserves and redemption practices. Most controversially, the PWG report advised Congress to pass new law limiting stablecoin issuance to insured depository institutions. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That effectively limits the field to banks, though stablecoin issuer Circle has said it is seeking that registration while also denying that it should be required of future issuers.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Limiting issuance has proved controversial with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, as it seems to lock in incumbents, whether they be established crypto firms like Circle or traditional giants of finance like JPMorgan Chase, and lock out potential newcomers. The Treasury has, however, seemed to maintain its support for the restriction, a push that Liang is still spearheading.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The report subsequently leveled the threat of action by the Financial Stability Oversight Council in the absence of new legislation on stablecoins.
