Yes, we are. And we are actively investigating that.\u201D","Cronje confirmed that if Fantom adopts optimistic rollups and provides a full transaction history on Ethereum, then Fantom would need to pay transaction fees to write these snapshots to Ethereum.","Fantom Foundation CEO Michael Kong added that implementing Layer 2 technology in this way will allow the Fantom network to access more liquidity from the Ethereum ecosystem.","Cronje, however, doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s any such thing as a Layer 2 network. He prefers to see what\u2019s typically referred to as a Layer 2 network as a sidechain and sees the optimistic rollup technology that combines them as a bridge between the two. He acknowledged it\u2019s a semantic difference, but one he said he\u2019s quite passionate about.","\u201CShould we adopt \u2014 or rather, when we adopt \u2014 that bridge, does that make us a Layer 2? No, because a Layer 2 is just a sidechain,\" he said.","Cronje argued that such Layer 2 technology, like optimistic rollups, is a bridging technology that allows for native assets to move to another blockchain in a slightly more secure way. But he argued that the security this technology provides is invalidated once there are other bridges connected to the blockchains in question.","\u201CIt does make the canonical assets safer, which is awesome and that's why we're investigating it. But at the same time, if something goes wrong and people try and get their assets out, they're not really going to be able to because it's likely that those assets were already bridged out by other mechanisms. The only times it would really work is if there is a complete chain halt,\u201D he said.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
