Now, the firm is interested in acquiring assets of other bankrupt companies.&nbsp;","\"We have a crypto venture team that has been investing off our balance sheet for five years,\" Kurz told the FT. Potential targets could be FTX's VC portfolio of real estate and technology companies that includes a stake in AI start-up Anthropic.","\"The record that we have on that side of our asset management business means we\u2019d be a good candidate for something like that,\" Kurz continued.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
