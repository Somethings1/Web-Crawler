If there are some that don\u2019t want to deal with us, then they don\u2019t have to.\"","\"And also this is entirely separate from the liquidation,\" he added. \"Teneo is the liquidator. They will sell the firm\u2019s assets and distribute it to creditors separately. But we have a number of creditors who were early that are whole or more already. And we have this process where we will donate over time. Again, entirely voluntary. This is something that we want to do. And it\u2019s only for people who wanted to participate. If they don\u2019t want to, they don\u2019t have to. But if they do, and they want to get involved, and the supported us before and the want to support us in the future, then by all means...\"","\"Are you trying to get people to buy a security?\" Bitcoiner Simon Dixon chimed in asking.","\"No no no,\" Davis insisted. \"Su and I are donating future earnings to this process. There's no token here.\"","\"There's no tradable asset here?\" crypto trader Ran Neuer asked.","\"No, not at all. There's no token here.\" Davies said. \"When thinking about life philosophies with Mark and Su, one of the things we really believe in is karma and something greater than all of us. For some people, that can be religion, philosophy, but we have this in common that there's something greater. And so we very much believe that if we do good and we say, to creditors who lost money, they have a way to make more back. If we do bad and they do well, then that's great. And that's good karma, or whatever you want to call it.\"&nbsp;","Three Arrows Capital filed for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/155578\/three-arrows-capital-files-for-chapter-15-bankruptcy-in-new-york\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chapter 15<\/a> bankruptcy protection on July 1, 2022.
