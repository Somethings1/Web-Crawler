While FTX later reported losses surpassing $450 million, the efforts of Ramanathan and the FTX team preserved a significant portion of the assets.","Ramanathan, associated with the consulting and restructuring firm Alvarez &amp; Marsall, volunteered to relocate a major portion of the company\u2019s assets to his device, thereby protecting between $400 and $500 million of FTX\u2019s cryptocurrency. The transactions, initiated by former CTO Gary Wang, helped mitigate further losses.","The assets were housed on Ramanathan\u2019s device until FTX\u2019s crypto custodian provider, BitGo, had cold storage wallets ready. Subsequently, the exchange collaborated with BitGo, safeguarding over $1.1 billion in total, Wired found.","Another $400 million was relayed to the Securities Commission of the Bahamas for protective purposes. This episode transpired shortly after former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/185083\/ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.","During the hack, FTX staff voiced concerns about potential delays in initializing BitGo\u2019s cold storage wallets, emphasizing the necessity for a prompt solution. As a result, Ramanathan volunteered to provide his Ledger wallet as a temporary security measure during an emergency meeting, as per the Wired report.","Nearly 11 months later, the identity of the hacker remains undetermined. In a later interview, Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/finance\/news\/sam-bankman-fried-says-ftx-203431501.html?guccounter=1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">alluded<\/a> to the possibility that an insider, potentially a \u201Cformer employee,\u201D might have accessed FTX\u2019s crypto wallet keys.
