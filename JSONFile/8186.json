The SEC is reportedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/159593\/the-sec-is-investigating-coinbase-over-its-coin-listings-bloomberg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">investigating<\/a> major U.S. exchange Coinbase for listing unregistered securities, and has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2022-26\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">already fined<\/a> BlockFi $100 million for securities violations.&nbsp;","For the past five years the SEC has signaled that most digital currencies are securities under U.S. law, and conducted dozens of enforcement actions against various projects for failing to register and follow other securities guidelines, as companies issuing stocks or bonds do. The commission currently carves bitcoin and ether out from securities laws because they are held by broad, decentralized networks of people.","Because of that distinction, cryptocurrency developers, investors, and advocates have complained that the regulatory agency has not provided enough guidance on what would qualify as a sufficiently decentralized project.","Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee that Gensler appeared before today, echoed that criticism and pressed the SEC chair for more specifics on what qualifies as decentralized enough to be exempted from standard disclosures.","\u201CIt is not reasonable to fail to provide clarity,\u201D said Toomey. \u201CWhat is it about bitcoin that causes you to think it\u2019s not a security?,\u201D Toomey asked.","Gensler responded: \u201CThe investment public\u2019s not betting on people in the middle.\u201D","Gensler expanded that he is following multiple past rulings by the Supreme Court on the definition of a security, in which a common enterprise seeks to raise capital, but directed his staff to, \u201Cuse everything in our regulatory toolkit, whether it\u2019s exemptive orders and others,\u201D to allow for some flexibility in the still-nascent space.","\u201CWe\u2019re in conversations with a number of these intermediaries across the exchange, the broker-dealer, the custody space,\u201D added Gensler. \u201CWe actually believe it\u2019s worthwhile to talk to the industry, talk to the market participants, and get them registered.\u201D","\u201CPeople will not have trust in this space unless it comes into investor protection,\u201D warned Gensler.","Â© 2023 The Block.
