It estimates it has lost $27,000 to 0% royalty marketplaces and is now taking measures to block anyone avoiding royalties from its Discord channels.","Magic Eden\u2019s defection was a blow to royalty supporters in the Solana network. The company accounts for 86% of the sales volume on Solana NFT marketplaces over the past month, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/solana-nft-marketplace-volume\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a> from Hello Moon. The second, third and fourth most popular marketplaces on Solana by sales volume (Solanart, YAWWW and Hadeswap) are also 0% royalty. Together they account for 99% of NFT sales on Solana.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/solana-nft-marketplace-volume\/embed\" title=\"Solana NFT Marketplace Volume\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\" data-v-f87c67ca>﻿<\/span><\/iframe>","Despite its decision, Magic Eden still supports creator royalties and it is committed to finding ways to make royalties enforceable, co-founder and COO Zhuoxun \u201CZedd\u201D Yin told The Block in an interview.","Creator royalties have long been touted as one of the top use cases for NFTs, allowing creators to make money on secondary sales. But there\u2019s no way to make people cough up on the protocol level. Instead, collecting royalties has traditionally been left to NFT marketplaces themselves. If markets don\u2019t collect, creators don\u2019t get paid. &nbsp;","Several royalty-free marketplaces have emerged over the last few months on both Ethereum and Solana. The most prominent is X2Y2 on Ethereum. In the last few months, it has taken around half of the share of marketplace volume on the chain, although it's not clear how much of this is wash trading, which is the practice of buying and selling the same NFT over and over to create a false impression of greater marketplace activity. By some <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/punk9059\/status\/1581136542726164480\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">calculations<\/a>&nbsp;X2Y2 and another marketplace, Sudoswap, have less than 20% of the market share when adjusted for wash trading.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/share-of-nft-marketplace-volume\/embed\" title=\"Share of NFT Marketplace Volume\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\" data-v-f87c67ca>﻿<\/span><\/iframe>","Nevertheless, they proved popular, taking market share from giants like Magic Eden and OpenSea. \u201CIn my view, this is sort of a classic prisoner's dilemma situation\u2026 We felt that in the absence of technically enforceable solution at the protocol level things would continue to trend basically toward optional royalties anyway,\u201D Yin said.&nbsp;","Not everyone agrees. Some believe that the move toward 0% royalties could even be a chain-specific issue. Despite X2Y2\u2019s gains on Ethereum, Fidenza artist Tyler Hobbs recently told <a href=\"https:\/\/decrypt.co\/112333\/ethereum-nft-market-more-serious-solana-fidenza-artist-tyler-hobbs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Decrypt<\/a> that \u201Cthe Ethereum space is really much more serious\u201D and that \u201Ccreators will put up much more of a fight.\u201D&nbsp;","\u201CWe did not want to go down this path. We tried to avoid this as long as possible because we knew that this decision is something that would be fairly controversial,\" Yin added.","Part of the fight is finding a way to enforce royalties or penalize those that don\u2019t pay them through technology that can track whether royalties have been paid on NFT trades. One such tool was created by Magic Eden itself. It launched Metashield last month as a tool for creators to track traders circumventing royalties and blur the NFT images of holders who didn\u2019t pay their dues.&nbsp;","Now it could be used to blur NFTs sold on Magic Eden's own platform. Unsurprisingly, Yin seems to regret the blurring feature and says Metashield in its current form isn\u2019t going to be developed any further by Magic Eden. But he\u2019s encouraging developers to tinker with it \u2014 and some have already reached out to take him up on the offer.","\u201COne of the lessons that we took away from the whole Metashield experience was that, as a marketplace, we should not be in the business of anything that really touches someone's NFT,\u201D said Yin. &nbsp;","But that doesn't mean it isn't open to funding projects that do. Magic Eden is planning to offer $1 million as prize money for a hackathon focused on the development of royalty protection tools and exploration of different ways for creators to monetize. Solana's co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko is among the judges.","Yet the fact remains that 0% marketplaces dominate the Solana ecosystem and have captured a large share of the market on Ethereum. In a bear market, not having to pay a premium on NFTs is simply too appealing to customers. Non-royalty trades are already <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/queries\/1428583?d=1&amp;category=abstraction&amp;namespace=magiceden&amp;table=events&amp;blockchains=solana\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">surpassing royalty trades<\/a> on Magic Eden. In addition, it has managed to claw back some market share from 0% competitors.","The data for Oct. 20 represents the number of sales as of 12pm UTC, not for the full 24-hour period.

Either the whole ecosystem has to come to the table to effectively figure out what is the right solution\u2026 Or this just regresses into a slow, slow burn toward basically 0% royalties,\u201D Yin said.&nbsp;","When asked whether it was thinking about following suit, a Rarible representative said that it was still discussing internally.","Solana NFT creation platform Metaplex was not immediately available for comment but directed The Block to documents stating that it believes 0% royalty trades create \u201Ca structural risk to the NFT economy at-large because it breaks the incentive alignment between creators and buyers.\u201D&nbsp;","OpenSea did not respond to multiple requests for comment.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
