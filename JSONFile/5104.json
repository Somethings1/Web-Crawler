He compared crypto to online gambling.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The FSMB gives more power to UK regulators, like the Financial Conduct Authority, to supervise crypto assets. The bill also regulates stablecoins used for payments, and sets restrictions on advertising crypto to UK citizens. The second reading session on Tuesday evening gave the upper house lawmakers the opportunity to flag concerns on the bill, and draft amendments.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Some members noted that crypto will need a whole new regulatory approach. \u201CThe constant evolution of digital assets represents not just a financial revolution, but also a technological and conceptual revolution that will not fit simply into existing regulatory categories and approaches,\u201D said Jonathan Hill, a member of the upper chamber.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CManaging emerging innovation opportunities while preventing abuse is going to pose some really serious capacity and structural challenges to the regulator.
