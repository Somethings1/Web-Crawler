Other changes to the bill under discussion include adding a required report on decentralized cryptocurrency protocols that would guide future regulation.&nbsp;","Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., co-author of the bill, told The Block last month that she hoped to hold a committee vote on the bipartisan bill before the end of this Congress, though little time remains to advance the bill after midterm elections. The Agriculture Commitee holds jurisdiction over the CFTC because a majority of commodities are agricultural products, like corn, soy, and other crops.&nbsp;","\u201CWe have no updates at this time and continue working with our Republican counterparts to find a time to advance our bipartisan crypto legislation,\u201D a Democratic committee spokesperson wrote in response to an inquiry. Patrick Creamer, a spokesperson for Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., Stabenow\u2019s Republican counterpart on the committee and bill co-author, stressed that talks around the bill remain \u201Cfluid.\u201D","In a public interview on Friday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler indicated support for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177224\/gensler-supports-granting-cftc-more-power-over-spot-markets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">greater CFTC crypto market authority<\/a>, and CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, a former Stabenow staffer, testified in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/170439\/cftc-chair-asks-senators-for-more-authority-in-crypto-markets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">favor<\/a> of the bill last month. Both sit on the super committee of regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174527\/senior-u-s-regulators-propose-new-legislation-increased-rules-around-digital-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">voted<\/a> to ask Congress to grant regulators more direct authority over digital commodities earlier this month. The SEC regulates securities, a rubric most digital assets fall under, but bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, are currently seen as commodities. The CFTC can enforce against fraud and market manipulation, as well as regulate derivatives and futures of those digital assets, but this bill would grant them the ability to regulate the actual bitcoin and ether markets.&nbsp;","Despite a narrow window to the bill becoming law before the end of this Congress, it has high profile support. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and CEO of crypto exchange FTX, has praised the legislation.
