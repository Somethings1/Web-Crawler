This unique level of transparency with DeFi is appealing to investors for many obvious reasons. <\/span>&nbsp;","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, just like CeFi, upsides come with downsides.

Both play for the same team and are after the same goals; fighting the weight of traditional banks cannot be accomplished by one without the other. Therefore, I believe this is not the end for CeFi, and for true mass adoption of crypto finance to occur, CeFi and DeFi must grow in harmony.\u202F<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by Haru Invest and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
