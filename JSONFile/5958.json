That means its bitcoin holdings are only valued at $2 billion on its balance sheet, half its fair market value.&nbsp;","\"Reporting crypto asset holdings under a fair value model, as proposed by the FASB, would enable us to provide investors with a more relevant view of our financial position and the economic value of our bitcoin holdings, which in turn would facilitate the ability of investors to make informed investment and capital allocation decisions,\" the company said.&nbsp;","The FASB voted on the proposal last year, and the changes are currently in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/saylor\/status\/1660630865100021761\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">public comment period<\/a>.","MicroStrategy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/131229\/sec-rebuffs-microstrategys-non-gaap-bitcoin-accounting-approach-report\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">faced pushback<\/a> from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2022 when it used non-GAAP measures to try and adjust bitcoin impairment charges. The company has long pushed for U.S. accounting standards to be updated to better account for crypto assets.","The company encourages interested parties to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fafsurveys.org\/se\/4CA36E922648D7BC\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">provide feedback<\/a> on the accounting rules proposal, which the FASB is accepting through June 6. In its letter, MicroStrategy submitted answers to eighteen separate questions.","\"Fair value is a more useful and balanced accounting model for investors than the current model, whereby only decreases in fair value are recognized, and subsequent increases are not,\" the company wrote. \"While the current model offers a distorted picture of an entity\u2019s crypto asset holdings that may confuse investors unfamiliar with the accounting standard it reflects, fair value accounting provides investors with the ability to make clear \u201Creturn on investment\u201D calculations, thereby providing the basis for economic reality-driven investment decisions.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
