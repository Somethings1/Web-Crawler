In the case of Europe, this is the Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regime being implemented this year. UAE has already stolen a march on other jurisdictions with its Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).","Bitpanda\u2019s deputy CEO Lukas Konrad says the European Union\u2019s promise of regulatory clarity is translating into adoption: the Raiffeisen partnership, which kicked off several months ago for customers in the capital city Vienna, has seen an adoption rate of 10%, with new investors buying mainly large-cap cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum tokens, he said.","\u201CEurope has a big benefit when it comes to crypto and that\u2019s a clear regulatory framework, which comes into force from January 2025 onwards,\u201D Konrad said in an interview. \u201CThe same regulatory clarity exists in the Dubai and Abu Dhabi regions. But in the U.S., this is not happening, making entities like banks hesitant. That\u2019s not the case in the UAE.\u201D","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January 2025","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Union","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vienna","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Konrad","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Dubai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Abu Dhabi","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA)","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitpanda","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Lukas Konrad","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Raiffeisen","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UAE","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Bitpanda","Austria","Raiffeisen Bank","UAE"],"authors":["Ian Allison"]}
