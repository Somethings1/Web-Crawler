These accounting tools \u2014 which include things like pausing contributions to government workers\u2019 retirement funds \u2014 are currently forecast to tide the U.S. over until June, the so-called X-date after which the government may have to resort to missing payments on its bonds.&nbsp;","While the U.S. has never defaulted on its a debt and a last-minute deal to salvage the situation is considered likely, Circle isn't alone in shunning Treasurys that mature after the X-date. The yield on the Treasury bill maturing May 23 has declined to about 4.2% while the yield for the bill maturing June 13 has risen to nearly 5.5%, according to data from Bloomberg. The two notes yielded roughly the same at the end of March.&nbsp;","Circle's USDC is the second-largest stablecoin, after tether, with about $29 billion worth in circulation, according to data compiled by The Block.&nbsp;&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/total-stablecoin-supply\/embed\" title=\"Total Stablecoin Supply\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","In a statement accompanying its quarterly results yesterday, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230241\/tether-attestation-report-q1-2023\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tether said about 85% or its reserves are held in cash<\/a>, cash equivalents and other short-term deposits.","© 2023 The Block.
