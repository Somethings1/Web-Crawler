Before the deal with Binance US, the crypto had a deal to sell itself to FTX \u2013 a transaction that fell apart when FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November.","According to the filing, Voyager\u2019s customers will receive an initial recovery of 36% of their crypto holdings \u2013 an abysmally low recovery rate compared to both estimates of their recovery rate of 72-73% if either of the acquisition plans were successful, as well as recovery estimates for creditors of other bankrupt crypto platforms. Celsius\u2019 creditors, for example, will receive an estimated 70% of their holdings.","The recovery rate could rise, according to the filing, if defunct crypto trading firm Alameda Research\u2019s attempt to claw back $446 million from Voyager\u2019s estate fails. In addition to reserving $446 million of the estate\u2019s holdings for the Alameda suit, Voyager\u2019s lawyers are also withholding an additional $259.6 million for litigation costs, administrative claims and assorted other \u201Choldbacks.\u201D","Creditors who have any of the 67 \u201Csupported\u201D tokens, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), stuck on the platform will be able to withdraw the allowable percent of their crypto directly. For those with any of the 38 \u201Cunsupported tokens,\u201D including Solana's SOL and Algorand's ALGO, Voyager will liquidate everything and pay customers back with USD coin (USDC), a stablecoin.","Objections to the planned liquidation process must be submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) by May 15 at 4 p.m. ET (20:00 UTC).","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"May 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York (SDNY","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"4 p.m.","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Voyager","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"73%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Alameda","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"36%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$446 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$259.6 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Voyager Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alameda Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Solana","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Binance US","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Algorand","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Voyager","Voyager Digital","Bankruptcy"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
