Before that, in late May, it had fallen 4.33%.","Mining difficulty refers to the complexity of the mathematical process behind mining, during which miners are repeatedly trying to find a hash below a set level. Miners that \"discover\" this hash win the reward for the next transaction block. Mining difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks) in sync with the network's hash rate.","Meanwhile, the network's hash rate has decreased by about 2.6% since June 8, the date of the last update, according to data compiled by The Block Research.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/bitcoins-hash-rate-daily\/embed\" title=\"Bitcoin's Hash Rate (EH\/s, 7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
