Mike Dudas, co-founder of LinksDAO and 6th Man Ventures, recently discussed the current landscape in an interview on The Scoop.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As Dudas explained during the interview:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CToday we're in this in-between world where many things that call themselves DAOs are really corporations but have a participatory governance mechanism. So it looks different than a corporation, but it's not truly decentralized and autonomous in the spirit of what I believe these organizations can become over the coming decade.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Indeed, LinksDAO perhaps illustrates the diversity among DAOs today.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dudas cited <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/124288\/a-dao-is-trying-to-buy-a-rare-print-of-the-us-constitution\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ConstitutionDAO<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> as an example of a \"legitimate DAO\" since fundraising was both decentralized and anonymous. While ConstitutionDAO was formed to raise funds for a specific auction, not all DAOs\u2019 missions are as straightforward.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the case of LinksDAO, a corporation named LinksDAO Inc. is responsible for fundraising and business development. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nWhile owners of LinksDAO NFTs are given membership rights to LinksDAO, they do not receive ownership rights to LinksDAO Inc.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe community is more of an advisory board, so we wouldn't be definitionally a DAO. We would be like a group of members who act as an advisory board to a C-corp.\u201D This division is a necessary reality because, as Dudas puts it, \u201Cin America in 2022 you can't sell an NFT to the public using Ethereum self-custody wallets without KYC that gives somebody ownership of an asset.<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, regardless of the structure of a DAO, projects are cropping up to serve them with tools, Dudas noted.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CRight now there are a number of what are called \u2018point solutions.\u2019 Early on in the evolution of any ecosystem, what happens is you have solutions that service the most important and critical functions for a DAO.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Funds like Bain Capital Crypto are eyeing this opportunity, with DAO service providers being one of the focus points of their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/137103\/bain-capital-crypto-execs-explain-why-theyre-setting-their-sights-on-dao-services\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recently announced $560 million fund.<\/span><\/a>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro and Dudas also discuss:<\/span><\/i>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fireblocks.com\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/coinbase.com\/prime\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase Prime<\/a> &amp; <a href=\"http:\/\/Chainalysis.com\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.
