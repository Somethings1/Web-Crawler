It is a secondary layer that performs off-chain computations with the goal of facilitating faster and cheaper transactions, while maintaining the security advantages of the Ethereum mainnet.&nbsp;","As part of the preparatory process for the mainnet launch, the Base core team carried out comprehensive internal and external security <a href=\"https:\/\/base.mirror.xyz\/_SiAx8dQRYJJ4lygkJc0QvBKvf16VVm7_-mdWMdFv20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">audits<\/a> to bolster the network's safety as well as that of the Optimism Protocol Stack (OP Stack). These reviews involved Coinbase protocol experts and over 100 external security researchers, the team noted in a statement.","Several tools for developers are now live on the Base mainnet. These include node providers Blockdaemon, QuickNode, and Blast, the Safe Wallet, block explorers Etherscan and Blockscout, and data indexers The Graph and Covalent, according to the team.","The team clarified that, as previously stated, there are no plans to issue a native token for Base. The official public launch of the Base mainnet is expected in August. The Base team previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233722\/1-million-wallets-use-coinbase-backed-bases-smart-contracts-during-testing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> its testnet drew interest from over a million wallet addresses deploying on the network.","Â© 2023 The Block.
