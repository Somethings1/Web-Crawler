Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein led the conversation.","Dorsey is said to be considering whether to add bitcoin to social media giant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/94459\/twitter-cfo-bitcoin-btc-balance-sheet-comments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter\u2019s balance sheet<\/a>, and his payments firm <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/80196\/square-bitcoin-purchase-details-paper\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Square<\/a> already holds bitcoin on its balance sheet. While other firms like Michael Saylor\u2019s MicroStrategy have touted bitcoin as an inflation hedge and a store of value for companies, Dorsey said Square integrated crypto payments and holds crypto itself as part of a larger mission to make bitcoin a widely used means of payment for all.","\u201CThe only reason Square got into bitcoin was to that end,\u201D he said.","Dorsey said he doesn\u2019t see central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a viable solution given its centralization and lack of privacy. Bitcoin replaces any need for a CBDC, according to Dorsey.","\u201CThe more we and our governments realize that and get in the boat sooner, the better off we all are,\u201D he said.","But regulators aren\u2019t overly concerned with bitcoin\u2019s \u201Cbad actor\u201D narrative, according to Dorsey. Though some claim that bitcoin\u2019s privacy-focused nature makes it a breeding ground for crime, such as repeated comments from Rep. Brad Sherman and other lawmakers, Dorsey said Square hasn\u2019t heard that line much from its regulators.","\u201CSquare was one of the first companies that was a public company that talked with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] about bitcoin \u2014 that never came up,\u201D he said.","At one point during the fireside chat, far-right activist and former Congressional candidate Laura Loomer interrupted Dorsey by shouting from the crowd, calling Dorsey the \u201Cking of censorship,\u201D and accusing him of inconsistency in his stance towards decentralization in finance but not in speech. Twitter has moved to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/97835\/twitter-suspension-crypto-influencers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suspend<\/a> the accounts of those it views as spreading misinformation or violating other terms of service on its platform, including Loomer.","\u201CHow can you say that this is a currency for everyone in the world when you are the king of censorship?\u201D asked Loomer.","Loomer has been banned for her commentary on Twitter as well as Clubhouse, Facebook and other major platforms.","Dorsey sought to address Loomer\u2019s comments by committing to integrating decentralization into his social media efforts, and pointed to Twitter\u2019s forthcoming decentralized project BlueSky. BlueSky is a team of five open-source architects creating a decentralized standard for social media, according to Dorsey. Though in 2019 Dorsey <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jack\/status\/1204766095246118912?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> the system wouldn\u2019t be ready for \u201Cmany years,\u201D Dorsey doubled down on his commitment to see it through.","\u201CI know you don\u2019t believe me, I know you\u2019re saying \u2018liar,\u2019\u201D said Dorsey. \u201CI\u2019m going to prove it to you and then we can have another conversation later.\u201D","Part of realizing a decentralized world is building noncustodial infrastructure, according to Dorsey. That\u2019s why he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/107250\/jack-dorsey-says-square-is-weighing-a-possible-bitcoin-hardware-wallet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> Square\u2019s interest in building a noncustodial hardware wallet just minutes before he took the stage. The purpose, he said, was to solicit industry feedback on the design.","\u201CWe don\u2019t want to compete with the hardware wallets out there, we just want to take it to the next level and get to a hundred more million people who have noncustodial solutions,\u201D he said."],"hashtag":["BITCOIN"]}
