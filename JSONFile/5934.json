This rate has been chosen to promote long-term sustainability and is algorithmically fixed by the SOV blockchain, so the supply cannot be manipulated,\" per the foundation.","The SOV will be introduced through a token pre-sale, and rights to future SOV will be sold in a series of auctions as part of a time-release monetary issuance (TRMI), which is expected to \"begin soon and will last for 18 months,\" according to the foundation.","Â© 2023 The Block.
