Ballard explained how the synergies between these groups will expand:","\"There's a variety of areas where oil and gas companies have megawatts of excess capacity that they've so capital into building out, but they're not utilizing on a daily basis. And we've had some success showing them those areas and where it's like, look, you can go build a very nice bitcoin mine on this facility.\"","Ballard also explained how the business models of oil and gas firms and bitcoin mining companies are nearly identical, with the main difference being the change in difficulty built into the bitcoin network.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro and Ballard also discuss:<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
