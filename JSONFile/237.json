But he noted that the ECB, which exists in part to ensure a stable euro, is wary of the fact that major blockchain networks primarily exist in areas outside of Europe, \"which raises concerns about strategic autonomy,\" Panetta said. &nbsp;","\"But despite the uncertainties surrounding DLT\u2019s potential, we want to be prepared for a scenario where market players adopt DLT for wholesale payments and securities settlement,\" said Panetta.<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> \"<\/strong>We must ensure that, in such a scenario, central bank money would still retain its role as the settlement asset for wholesale transactions.\"","Panetta implied that the ECB's path forward will largely depend on how prominently stablecoins or central bank digital currencies figure into payments. The central bank's current research efforts are more focused around continuing to \"anchor\" the euro as a stable currency by being poised to build infrastructure better connecting existing payments rails to stablecoins, CBDCs, or more decentralized networks if needed.&nbsp;","Panetta noted that the European financial system already has real-time payments, a major selling point of stablecoins, and that blockchain-based payments will need to \u201Cprove\u201D that they are superior to other existing technologies. Furthermore, \u201Cimplications for governance, settlement efficiency and liquidity management need to be carefully assessed.\u201D","The ECB is amping up resources towards digital currencies and its use cases. It kick-started a two-year investigation into the digital euro in July 2021, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/170734\/amazon-among-five-companies-to-develop-digital-euro-prototype-for-the-ecb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> the partners in the prototype development earlier in September.
