These companies can help route transactions and support merchant and P2P acceptance, e.g. last-mile transfer to personal wallets and merchants.","There are online payment processors such as Stripe and PayU, who help to assure smooth online merchant acceptance.","There are crypto native companies such as Coinbase, Xapo, Anchorage and Bison Trails.","There are telecom companies include Iliad and Verifone.","There are major merchants including eBay, Booking.com, Mercado Libre and Farfetch.","But there are no banks.","","","JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi and more are conspicuously absent. Each reaps billions in fees annually by issuing credit cards, acting as merchant processors\/acquirers and providing other commercial and retail payment services in a <a href=\"https:\/\/wallethub.com\/edu\/cc\/credit-card-transaction\/25511\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">complex payments system<\/a>. This business could very well be up for grabs in a world of frictionless global merchant and P2P payments with dramatically lower fees.","Furthermore, banks are heavily regulated in the U.S. and in other countries. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jpmorgan.com\/country\/PE\/EN\/disclosures\/investment-bank-legal-entity-disclosures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A partial list of the regulators<\/a> that JPMorgan answers to will make the head spin. As a result, banks are understandably hesitant to dabble even in established cryptocurrencies. They certainly are not prepared to be founding members of a pre-launch \"stablecoin\" project set to be released in 2020 by the earliest with many details still to be worked out.","Now some banks, such as JPMorgan, are pursuing \"cryptocurrency\" efforts such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/02\/14\/jp-morgan-launches-its-own-cryptocurrency-the-first-for-a-major-us-bank\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JPM Coin,<\/a> while specialty banks like Silvergate provide banking services to cryptocurrency-related companies.&nbsp;","However, Facebook and the Libra Association are proposing something extremely powerful: a non-state currency backed by a basket of assets. They are proposing something that would challenge smaller government central banks if it were to be widely adopted.","Surely, Facebook and the Libra Association are working hard behind the scenes to appease regulators in the U.S., UK and elsewhere. In fact they recently hired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/uk-standard-chartered-lobbyist-has-reportedly-joined-facebook-to-help-with-cryptocurrency-launch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a senior lobbyist in the UK<\/a> for this purpose.","But the facts remain: these governments and central banks are deeply intertwined with the largest banks in nearly every country in the world, from a regulatory and dependency perspective.
