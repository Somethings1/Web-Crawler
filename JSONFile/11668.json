She declined to comment on the valuation but said it was an up round, meaning it was more than Cega's last valuation of $60 million.","The latest round brings Cega's total funding to date to $9.3 million. It raised $4.3 million last March.","Cega is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/solana\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Solana<\/a>-based derivatives protocol focused on exotic options structured products. While regular options allow users to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price and time, exotic options, on the other hand, are more customized and have additional conditions attached to them.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nToyosaki said Cega's exotic options are carefully designed that help traders earn \"safer yields in volatile market environments.\" The company offers principal protection against severe market movements of up to a 90%, she added.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\"A very popular strategy on Cega is you are betting that in the next 27 days that neither bitcoin nor ether will fall more than 50%. And if you are right, which like 90% of the time you are, you would be able to get 12% APY,\" Toyosaki said.","Cega's protocol went live last June and has seen a peak total value locked of around $50 million, Toyosaki said, adding that the collapse of the FTX exchange saw massive withdrawals. Cega's current <a href=\"https:\/\/app.cega.fi\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TVL<\/a> stands at $6.3 million, according to its website.","The main reason for the fundraise was to expand its protocol on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum<\/a>, Toyosaki said, adding it will launch new products there including leveraged options. The launch on Ethereum is scheduled for next week.","As part of the expansion, Cega will keep its Solana-based products in \"maintenance mode,\" meaning its existing products will continue to be available on Solana. The availability of new products on Solana, however, will depend on factors including volume.&nbsp;","Cega will also launch a new market-making entity called&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.trasmobian.xyz\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tras Mobian<\/a>&nbsp;next week that will focus on both vanilla and exotic crypto derivatives.","\"The new, separate entity is so far funded by proprietary trades as I had quite a successful last year,\" Toyosaki said. Cega currently employs 15 people, and the new entity has already hired a small team, she added.","Given its expertise in exotic options, Cega also plans to launch white-label services in the future to develop strategies for other centralized and decentralized platforms, said Toyosaki.","Cega also has plans to launch a token in the future, Toyosaki said, declining to comment on the timeline.","\"We do look to compensate early users,\" she said, adding that&nbsp;Cega also plans to support other blockchains, especially DeFi-native chains.","Â© 2023 The Block.
