The company attributed this recovery to a 467% surge in bitcoin production coupled with a 32% increase in average bitcoin prices during the period.","Marathon sold 66% of the bitcoin it produced in Q3 to cover operational costs, realizing gains of $31.7 million, partially offset by impairment costs of $11.9 million. \u201CThis quarter also uniquely benefited from a $82.6 million gain from the extinguishment of debt while the year-ago period included a $29.8 million gain on sale of equipment, a $25 million legal reserve and a $39 million impairment due to vendor bankruptcy, all of which did not reoccur in 2023, \u201C the company noted.","\u201CWe made significant progress on our 2023 strategic priorities in the third quarter,\u201D Marathon Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel added. \u201CFirst, we grew our energized hash rate 8% quarter-over-quarter to 19.1 exahashes. In addition, our new facility in Garden City started energizing last week and is expected to be fully operational later this month. Second, we experienced significantly higher uptime as optimization efforts helped increase our U.S. average operational hash rate 18% from last quarter to 14.2 exahashes. Third, we energized our first joint venture and our first international location in the UAE.\u201D&nbsp;","\u201CThis initial success has helped open new opportunities, and we recently entered into a new joint venture in Paraguay powered by hydroelectricity,\u201D he said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Thiel said Marathon took proactive measures to strengthen its financial position during the quarter, achieving a significant debt reduction and cash savings for shareholders in preparation for next year's bitcoin halving event \u2014 expected in April.
