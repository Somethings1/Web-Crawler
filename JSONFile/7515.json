Specifically, it is hoping to capitalize off of the \"land\" it owns in virtual worlds built by Decentraland and The Sandbox.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Atari's Head of Blockchain Manfred Mantschev told host Frank Chaparro on The Scoop: \u201CWhen these plots came up the value of the adjacent plots would go up because people recognized the Atari brand, and that image would basically drive people, drive interest to the whole project. So that's kind of how we got started.\u201D Real estate in the metaverse continues to sell for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/108940\/an-estate-in-virtual-world-decentraland-just-sold-for-nearly-a-million-dollars\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">record breaking<\/a> amounts.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With early hits such as <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Pac Man, Pong, and Centipede,<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Atari is known as a landmark maker of arcade games of the 70s and 80s. Today, Atari\u2019s familiar brand is often seen in nostalgia plays for consumers. By appearing in productions like Stranger Things, Ready Player One and Blade Runner the company has found new relevance.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Atari is hoping to onboard a wider audience into the metaverse in the same way that big brand storefronts attract shoppers to enter a shopping mall. Its mission now, Mantschev explained, is to convince users to enter the metaverse, where Atari hopes to be a familiar face in a new virtual world. <\/span>\"The same way a mall wants to have a flagship store in the mall and smaller stores next to it are prepared to pay higher rents just because there is a sought-after anchor tenant in the mall.\"&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">How exactly Atari plans to incorporate its established games and brand is unclear, but the company is exploring numerous on-chain product offerings including gamified NFTs that can unlock special user privileges in a game. Mantschev, who collects NFTs himself, believes that NFTs are \u201Cfront and center\u201D for Atari. <\/span>In this way, Atari sees <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the metaverse as a means of enabling people to own their IP and views <\/span>their early entrance into the metaverse as a functionally important builder of this new gaming ecosystem.","© 2023 The Block.
