Once the voting is finalized, all votes will be revealed, along with their respective addresses as well as automatic calculation of results.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Snapshot's shielded voting uses a cryptographic solution that leverages threshold encryption, and was developed in partnership with Shutter Network.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Snapshot<\/a> is one of the most widely-used governance tools among crypto projects. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The off-chain voting system is used by hundreds of DAOs to democratically make decisions on topics such as roadmap and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/150847\/frax-co-founders-propose-spending-20-million-to-buyback-fxs-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">treasury spending<\/a> via multiple-choice or a simple \"yes or no\" voting scheme.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whenever there is a governance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/152690\/decentraland-dao-votes-to-give-decentral-games-1-million-grant\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">vote<\/a> on Snapshot, anyone can check data on who is voting and for which voting option.

Knowing how others voted has an influence on our own voting behavior.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Any DAO using Snapshot will be able to enable shielded voting in their admin view. The feature is currently at the end of its closed beta and will be released this week for everyone to test.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
