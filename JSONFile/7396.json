As a result, they may be subject to slippage costs, making them ideal targets for MEV bots to exploit through sandwich attacks.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During a sandwich event, a bot identifies a pending user transaction and submits a transaction with a higher gas price to buy or sell the same cryptocurrency just before the user's transaction, thereby causing a price change. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Afterward, the bot quickly executes another transaction to buy or sell the cryptocurrency, taking advantage of the change.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While this form of front-running can yield substantial profits for malicious actors, it adversely affects the trading experience for regular investors who are<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> often urged to use tools that can provide protection from the threat. The adoption of these resources, however, remains limited within the crypto community.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The growing interest in memecoins, combined with an increase in MEV activities, has been cited as a contributing factor to the recent spike in Ethereum gas fees, which are currently hovering around <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/gastracker#gassender\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">70 gwei<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.
