Most of the world still doesn\u2019t own any crypto, or even really understand what it is. An interesting thing about Bitcoin is that unlike other technologies (VR, e.g.) where someone who was directionally correct (VR in some form will almost certainly be incredible) but had the timing wrong gets completely wrecked. With Bitcoin, early adopters are rewarded, and as adoption continues, the price continues to climb. Even if massive adoption doesn\u2019t happen as fast as people want it to, a patient HODLer is likely to be rewarded, especially if BTC continues to adopt provably good new tech (like e.g. Schnorr).","I\u2019ve noticed this kind of slow, creeping adoption a lot more over the past few months. More and more people know what Bitcoin is, or have a rough idea. A much smaller percentage of them maybe bought some on Coinbase or Cash.app. Today I went to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csail.mit.edu\/event\/lcs35-time-capsule-event\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">really cool event at MIT<\/a> where a time capsule was unveiled 15 years early\u2014the story being that Ron Rivest (the R in RSA) designed a tricky puzzle that involved an intrinsically sequential computation (in order to resist efforts at leveraging massively parallel computation) that was intended to take around 35 years to solve based on Moore\u2019s Law estimations. Two teams managed to solve it faster (one slightly after the other, one with pure software and commodity hardware, one with an FPGA) and the winning guy immediately stamped his proof of solution on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain in an OP_RETURN, and then again on the BTC blockchain (this time in an actual block header, <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">swag<\/em>, with the help of a big mining pool).","No one seemed to bat an eye at this. Of course you stamp things on the Bitcoin blockchain when you want to have a time-based proof that something happened. As one does! This type of thing seems to fall in line with the idea that Bitcoin blockspace will remain a valuable commodity even in the post-coinbase reward era.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jimmy on Bitcoin<\/strong>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinops.org\/en\/newsletters\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Optech<\/a>&nbsp;on Bitcoin [ed: sign up for their newsletter too! it\u2019s great!]<\/strong>","Taproot proposal soft fork discussion:&nbsp;several replies were posted to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list in response to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sipa\/bips\/blob\/bip-schnorr\/bip-taproot.mediawiki\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bip-taproot<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sipa\/bips\/blob\/bip-schnorr\/bip-tapscript.mediawiki\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bip-tapscript<\/a>.","Addition of derivation paths to BIP174 PSBTs:&nbsp;Stepan Snigirev&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/lists.linuxfoundation.org\/pipermail\/bitcoin-dev\/2019-April\/016894.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">posted<\/a>&nbsp;a suggestion to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list to allow PSBTs to include the BIP32 derivation path for the public keys used to generate the change output\u2019s address.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aviv from Spacemesh<\/strong>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Spacemesh is a programmable cryptocurrency powered by a novel proof-of-space-time consensus protocol.<\/em>","<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/spacemeshos\/go-spacemesh\/pull\/875\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mining flow automation tests<\/a>","<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/spacemeshos\/go-spacemesh\/pull\/867\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Added automation tests for sync<\/a>","<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/spacemeshos\/go-spacemesh\/pull\/886\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sync automation sanity<\/a>","<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/spacemeshos\/go-spacemesh\/pull\/881\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated PoET and PoST to more efficient merkle tree<\/a>","<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/spacemeshos\/smapp\/pull\/93\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Network screen - initial commit<\/a>","<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/spacemeshos\/go-spacemesh\/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+review%3Aapproved\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Merged PRs<\/a>","Full update at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/spacemesh.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">https:\/\/spacemesh.io<\/a>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JZ from Decred<\/strong>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Decred&nbsp;is an autonomous digital currency with a hybrid consensus system.
