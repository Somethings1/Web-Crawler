When he was the same age, Buterin recalled being praised as a wunderkind, transforming the world. \u201CWatching all of these people go further than I did, younger than I did, made me clearly realize that if that was ever my role, it is no longer,\u201D Buterin wrote.","Buterin explained his thinking has changed over the last ten years, as has the world around him, involving less crypto-focused economics than it used to and exploring other areas like longevity research.","Following the demise of FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried, a social media <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/venturefounder\/status\/1590072787020165121\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">post<\/a> also got Buterin thinking about the casualty rate of crypto\u2019s \u201Cmain characters,\u201D saying it was the moment he realized that most of the people he\u2019d looked up to in the space and could follow in the footsteps of were \u201Cno more.\u201D","After U.S. Visa complications prevented an internship at Ripple in 2013, Buterin focused on his work at Bitcoin Magazine before introducing Ethereum at BTC Miami in 2014. The \u201Csocial proof\u201D of the reception at his presentation solidified his choice to leave University.","However, most of Buterin's decisions in Ethereum responded to pressure and requests from other people, he said, reflecting on accepting an invite to meet Vladimir Putin in 2017, which he subsequently regretted, realizing that he \u201Cno longer had the luxury of sitting back and letting mystical \u2018other people\u2019 run the show.\u201D He had responsibilities and needed to be intentional about how he operated.","\u201CI was one of the mystical other people, and it was up to me to play the part. If I do not, and the crypto space either stagnates or becomes dominated by opportunistic money-grabbers more than it otherwise would have as a result, I have only myself to blame,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd so I decided to become careful in which of others' plans I go along with, and more high-agency in what plans I craft myself.\u201D","But ultimately, Buterin now believes it\u2019s time to support the next wave of developers and thinkers, \u201CI am now in some different kind of role, and it is time for the next generation to take up the mantle that used to be mine,\u201D he said.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
