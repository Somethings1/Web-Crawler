The three competed in a hotly contested final with Uniswap emerging as the eventual winner.","Developers competed in a Mario Kart-style racing game rewarding technical abilities where each team\u2019s cars are a smart contract. MatchboxDAO described it as a web3 version of \"chess and poker.\"","\"I've been in the Ethereum ecosystem since 2016. This is actually my first experience with a web3 game like this,\" said Daniel Gretzke, technical lead of smart contracts at Polygon Labs.","While there is a trend towards web3 games only having assets on-chain rather than the gameplay itself, 0xMonaco is a fully on-chain game.","Teams need to create a strategy for each car before the race that involves properly managing resources for accelerating, firing shells, super shells or buying a shield, each of which costs coins. Players are allocated 17,500 coins at the beginning of the game.","In addition to coding skills, competitors also need to anticipate what other players are planning.","\"I enjoy this type of competition because it allows you to show your skills,\u201D said Jonathan Giamporcaro, a blockchain research and development engineer at Ledger.","It\u2019s not the only web3 game that allows devs to flex their coding muscles though. Giamporcaro told The Block he\u2019s also a fan of Node Guardians, a platform for web3 builders which offers a range of coding challenges.","Uniswap's team said it would open-source its winning code for 0xMonaco.","Â© 2023 The Block.
