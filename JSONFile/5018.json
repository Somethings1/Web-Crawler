Keys to hot wallets holding tens of millions of dollars-worth of assets weren\u2019t securely stored, and the reliance on hot wallets themselves goes against standard industry practice, the report says.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C[T]he FTX Group kept virtually all crypto assets in hot wallets, which are far more susceptible to hacking, theft, misappropriation, and inadvertent loss than cold wallets because hot wallets are internet-connected,\u201D the report said. \u201CPrudently-operated crypto exchanges keep the vast majority of crypto assets in cold wallets, which are not connected to the internet, and maintain in hot wallets only the limited amount necessary for daily operation, trading, and anticipated customer withdrawals.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the report, Ray alleges that Bankman-Fried and others \u201Clied\u201D when asked about their security practices by customers and counterparties.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Those wallets did not require multisignature capabilities to transfer assets, meaning any one employee could remove millions of dollars-worth of assets, and keys to wallets weren\u2019t well-protected.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX\u2019s current management identified private keys for different wallets, including one with over $100 million in \u201CEthereum assets\u201D, stored in plain text without encryption and easily accessible. Separately, private keys to billions of dollars-worth of additional digital assets were stored within an Amazon Web Services password manager that \u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">many FTX Group employees\u201D had access to and could transfer those assets by themselves, whenever they wanted to.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alameda Research, the sister hedge fund owned by Bankman-Fried, had similar security issues.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CFor example, a key for $600 million dollars\u2019 worth of crypto assets was titled with four non-descriptive words, and stored with no information about what the key was for, or who might have relevant information about it. [Bankman-Fried companies] identified other keys to millions of dollars in crypto assets that were simply titled \u2018use this\u2019 or \u2018do not use,\u2019 with no further context.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To punctuate its point, the report notes that $432 million worth of digital assets were stolen from FTX by a malicious actor the night the majority of the crypto empire was placed into bankruptcy by Bankman-Fried. The report says that $1.4 billion of digital assets have been recovered and secured in cold wallet storage, but have identified an additional $1.7 billion in digital assets that still need to be recovered.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blockchain analysis firms TRM and Chainalysis have been contracted to assist in tracking down those assets.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aside from being highly vulnerable to theft or hacking, a number of wallet keys weren\u2019t backed up.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMany FTX Group private keys were stored without appropriate backup procedures such that if the key was lost, the associated crypto assets would likely be permanently lost,\u201D putting the world\u2019s then-second largest digital asset firm in the same position as individual crypto owners who forgot to transfer their private key over from an old laptop.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CBecause the FTX Group failed to maintain appropriate records of access to private keys, employees or others could potentially copy those keys to their own electronic devices and transfer the associated crypto assets without detection,\u201D the report continues.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alameda Research, the investment firm co-founded by Bankman-Fried and Wang prior to FTX, had no idea how much money it had, or didn\u2019t have. But the firm kept operating through money it took from FTX in return for IOUs, if anything at all.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAlameda often had difficulty understanding what its positions were, let alone hedging or accounting for them,\u201D the report reads. \u201CFor the vast majority of assets, Alameda\u2019s recordkeeping was so poor that it is difficult to determine how positions were marked.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bankman-Fried highlighted Alameda\u2019s black box nature in an internal communication included in the report submitted to court.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C\u2018Alameda is unauditable,\u2019\u201D Bankman-Fried wrote. \u201C\u2018I don\u2019t mean this in the sense of \u2018a major accounting firm will have reservations about auditing it\u2019; I mean this in the sense of \u2018<\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">we <\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">are only able to ballpark what its balances are, let alone something like a comprehensive transaction history.\u2019\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To emphasize this, he added, \u201CWe sometimes find $50m of assets lying around that we lost track of; such is life.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The former FTX CEO used Alameda as his personal piggybank, transferring tens of millions to a personal bank account in 2021 and 2022 but listing the transactions as \u201Cinvestments-cryptocurrency.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But funds from FTX.com, which was the primary retail investment platform owned by Bankman-Fried, kept his investment firm afloat.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C[T]he FTX Group configured the codebase of FTX.com and associated customer databases to grant Alameda an effectively limitless ability to trade and withdraw assets from the exchange regardless of the size of Alameda\u2019s account balance, and to exempt Alameda from the auto-liquidation process that applied to other customers,\u201D the report reads. It notes that existing controls by \u201Cfinancial institutions and exchanges in established financial markets\u201D would have prevented the withdrawals.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The backdoor from FTX.com to Alameda existed since July 31, 2019, but Bankman-Fried tweeted that \u201C\u2018just like everyone else\u2019s\u2019\u201D and \u201C\u2018Alameda\u2019s incentive is just for FTX to do as well as possible.\u2019\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The backdoor inserted into FTX.com\u2019s operational code allowed Alameda a line of credit with FTX of up to $65 billion.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An investigation by caretaker FTX group leadership into Alameda remains ongoing, the report notes.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Decision-making at FTX was so tightly-controlled by a small group of executives, the report says, that an executive said if either co-founder Gary Wang or engineering head Nishad Singh were incapacitated then the whole multi-billion dollar operation would effectively end, due to the lack of technical know-how among other members of leadership, including Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The court-submitted document quotes an anonymous FTX executive saying, \u201Cif Nishad [Singh] got hit by a bus, the whole company would be done.
