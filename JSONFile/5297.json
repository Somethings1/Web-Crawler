The strategy involves purchases of Cosmos\u2019 native token, as well as investments in projects developing in the Cosmos ecosystem.&nbsp;","North Island co-founder Travis Scher said developers have started to gravitate toward Cosmos \u201Cpretty heavily\u201D over the last six months.","\u201CThe momentum around Cosmos is now very real,\u201D Scher said in an interview. \u201CThe traction with end users is still fairly limited, but I think that Cosmos is building ahead of where the market is going.\u201D","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172998\/cosmos-contributors-release-new-whitepaper-showcasing-two-big-ideas\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cosmos<\/a> is a blockchain network consisting of interoperable, application-specific blockchains. These chains can interact with one another using the Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. The Cosmos Hub is an independent blockchain and is secured by validators who stake Cosmos\u2019 native token called ATOM.","North Island\u2019s second fund is nearly double the size of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/93784\/paul-tudor-jones-ll-cool-j-and-more-back-new-72-million-crypto-vc-fund\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">predecessor<\/a>, which closed in 2020 with a total of $70 million, and has made around 30 investments. The new fund is expected to be invested in 30 to 40 firms primarily in seed-stages.","\u201CThe fund is a bit bigger than the last fund primarily because the opportunity set in crypto is meaningfully larger than it was in 2020,\u201D Scher said. \u201CBack in 2020 there were only really two blockchains that had any usage or momentum at all. There was no interest or momentum in NFTs whatsoever. There was just budding momentum in the DeFi space.\u201D","While crypto investment opportunities have multiplied since the firm\u2019s first fund, Scher acknowledges that now isn\u2019t exactly the best time to deploy the newly raised cash.","\u201CWe just experienced a bubble in crypto, so I think we are most certainly seeing a pullback in terms of investment dollars getting put to work,\u201D Scher said. \u201CVenture investing in crypto over the next 12 months will be meaningfully less than it was over the previous 12 months.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
