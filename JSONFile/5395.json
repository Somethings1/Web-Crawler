Normal people come on if there are killer applications for them to use,\u201D said Sei Labs co-founder Jayendra Jog. \u201CAnd killer applications only come once you set up the right guardrails for developers to come, and Plaid is one example of these guardrails.\u201D","Sei Foundation is responsible for creating and launching the Sei blockchain while Sei Labs, which operates separately, is creating software that uses the blockchain. Sei Labs is led by a team of people who previously worked at high-profile organizations like Goldman Sachs, Google, and Nvidia, the company said in a statement.","For Jog and his team, using trusted web2 companies that provide effective infrastructure like payment rails, is paramount if blockchain-powered applications hope to attract average consumers.","\u201CThere\u2019s this really strong misconception from people in crypto that crypto is just going to completely replace everything that exists in traditional finance,\u201D said Jog. \u201CThat might happen 50 years from now, but I think it\u2019s going to be a much more gradual process. And the most clear way to get more on-chain adoption is rather than trying to replace everything, by collaborating with the systems that already exist.\u201D","Jog also said his company is particularly focused on scaling so it can attract talented developers keen to build web3 applications. He's confident the Sei blockchain is made of the right stuff.","\u201CSei is currently the fastest blockchain in existence,\u201D he said. \u201CSo it\u2019s faster than Solana. It\u2019s faster than Aptos.\u201D","Earlier this year Sei Labs raised $30 million from investors including Jump and Distributed Global.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Update: Sei Labs initally claimed in a press release that it had partnered with Plaid.
