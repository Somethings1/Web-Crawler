Notably, Cusack revealed that the firm also received a small grant of less than $50,000 from MakerDAO to pay for its first security audit.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Second, a part of the new fund will be put into the interest pool as \u201Csponsored Dai,\u201D which will contribute to the weekly yield but will not be eligible to win the lottery. The pool currently features approximately $250,000 worth of sponsored Dai, the company said, and the new addition is set to raise the system\u2019s expected value.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Third, PoolTogether initially planned to keep 10 percent of the yield earned for itself but has since then implemented a zero-fee model. The new investment will support the firm as it provides no-fee services.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Beyond the above immediate enhancements, the investment will also finance PoolTogether as it launches new pools and features.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Cusack, the firm is planning on releasing<\/span> a new USDC-based pool with daily prizes. <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIncreasing the frequency of the prizes improves the probability for small depositors,\u201D he said. \u201CThis new daily prize pool uses USDC, so we're also expanding the token types people can use.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moreover, the firm is developing a new feature, \u201Cpods,\u201D which enables users to link their tickets together and share the prize if they win. This ticket-pooling feature will allow users with small deposits to compete with those holding much larger funds, Cusack said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">PoolTogether has seen rapid growth since its launch, with a recent pool amassing over <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$195,000 from 1,187 unique players, The Block previously <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/pooltogether-no-loss-lottery-54004\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cusack believes that the platform\u2019s growth is spurred by the \u201Cflywheel effect\u201D that has started to emerge in Jan., where more deposits lead to larger prizes and larger prizes, in turn, lead to more deposits.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAs people have seen this trend in action, I think that generates a lot of interest,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Moreover, according to <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cusack, while platforms linking savings products to prizes are prevalent in traditional finance, they are still lacking in the Ethereum ecosystem.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CPrize linked savings products have been massively popular in traditional finance.
