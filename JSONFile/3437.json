However, the activities described in the indictment seem more related to software provision and communication services than money transmission, Coin Center\u2019s Research Director Peter Van Valkenburgh said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coincenter.org\/new-tornado-cash-indictments-seem-to-run-counter-to-fincen-guidance\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">post<\/a> yesterday.","The Bank Secrecy Act defines money transmitter services as \u201Cthe acceptance of currency, funds or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means.\u201D","According to the 2019 FinCEN Virtual Currency Guidance, anonymizing software providers are not considered money transmitters, Van Valkenburgh said. The guidance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2019-05\/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">states<\/a>, \u201CFinCEN regulations exempt from the definition of money transmitter those persons providing 'the delivery, communication, or network access services used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services.' This is because suppliers of tools (communications, hardware or software) that may be utilized in money transmission, like anonymizing software, are engaged in trade and not money transmission.\u201D","Tornado Cash's tools were provided in a manner consistent with this guidance, Van Valkenburgh argued.","The indictment's allegations, including the defendants' control over UI and smart contract software hosting, their design and advertising of the Tornado Cash tool, and profiting from a governance token, do not necessarily equate to the \"acceptance and transmission\" of money, Van Valkenburgh said. \u201CAdvertising or profiting from the creation of mere software, that fact alone doesn\u2019t change the provision of software into the provision of regulated financial services,\u201D he added.","Tornado Cash is open-source software that can be used to anonymize transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.","The DOJ charged Storm and Semenov with \"conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business,\" according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/news\/press-releases\/jy1702\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/a> yesterday.","The charges relate to the pair\u2019s alleged creation, operation and promotion of Tornado Cash \u2014 \u201Ca cryptocurrency mixer that facilitated more than $1 billion in money laundering transactions and laundered hundreds of millions of dollars for the Lazarus Group, the sanctioned North Korean cybercrime organization,\u201D the DOJ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-sdny\/pr\/tornado-cash-founders-charged-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>.","The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control also announced Wednesday that Roman Semenov had been added to its <a href=\"https:\/\/ofac.treasury.gov\/recent-actions\/20230823\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Specially Designated Nationals<\/a> list of sanctioned companies and individuals subject to having their assets blocked and prohibited from doing business with U.S. persons.
