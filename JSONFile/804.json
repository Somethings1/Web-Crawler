Islim noted the firm \"intends to establish a customary claims process for clients.\" The Chapter 11 process means there's an automatic stay that prevents Genesis from paying out on any claims to its lending customers.","The firm took a financial hit following the collapses of the crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and the FTX exchange last year \u2014 which Islim highlighted in his letter.","The firm halted withdrawals and new loan originations from its lending affiliate on Nov. 16. Genesis told clients on Jan. 4 that it was continuing to work toward finding a solution for the troubled borrowing and lending unit and that it needed more time to do so."],"hashtag":["BANKRUPTCY FILINGS","CAMERON &AMP; TYLER WINKELVOSS","CRYPTO BANKS AND LENDERS"]}
