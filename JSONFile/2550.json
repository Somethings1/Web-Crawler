It said it had been \u201Cblindsided\u201D by the announcement from Minecraft makers Mojang Studios \u2014 which Microsoft acquired in 2014.","In a blog published on Wednesday, Mojang Studios said NFT integrations were \"generally not something we will support or allow.\u201D The post raised concerns that NFTs create a culture of unequal access.","In a Discord update on Wednesday night, the team at NFT Worlds said it was looking at several options for how to continue the project, including trying to get in touch with \u201Cthe right decision makers within the Minecraft policy enforcement team\u201D to understand the change and see if there are any possibilities for continuing operations using Minecraft.","It also laid out several options should this fail, including transitioning into their own Minecraft-like game engine and games platform, and collaborating with other projects.","The effects of the announcement are already hitting NFT Worlds, however. OpenSea data for July 21 shows the sale of 555 NFTs from the NFT Worlds collection compared with 16 the day before. The average price has dropped too, from 3.33ETH to 1.06ETH.","Mojang Studios is not alone in its dislike for blockchain technology among the gaming community.

Steam prohibited crypto, NFT and blockchain games in mid-October last year.","Mojang's move has drawn some harsh criticism. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ysiu\/status\/1550068515188535296\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter thread<\/a> on Thursday, Yat Siu, executive chairman of Animoca Brands \u2014<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> the company behind metaverse project The Sandbox and which has no stake in NFT Worlds <\/span>\u2014 likened Microsoft and Minecraft to a \u201Cdigital dictatorship.\u201D&nbsp;","Siu colorfully accused the two of causing \u201Cpain and suffering to an innocent [and] blameless minority who was purged and cleansed without regard to their circumstances and without advance notice,\u201D and said the companies had provided no proof that NFTs are harmful to their community.","\u201CBlockchain and NFTs are not a threat to Minecraft or the gaming community, it is a threat to closed platforms\/monopolies who control every aspect of our digital lives and wish to continue extracting every ounce of value from our time and attention,\u201D he said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
