So do customers with multiple accounts who make transactions to self-hosted wallets that aren\u2019t operated by a regulated CASP, or are located in supposedly under-regulated overseas jurisdictions.","Banks looking to take on crypto clients will also need to check their regulatory license and ownership, the guidance said.","In recent months and years, the European Union has sought to tackle money laundering risks from secretive crypto transactions. New money laundering rules could curb trades with self-hosted wallets where the owner can\u2019t be identified, and may even ban anonymous coins such as zcash, monero and dash outright. In a March proposal, the EBA also highlighted extra risks for businesses that use crypto-style distributed ledger technology.","Meanwhile, U.S. authorities have sanctioned Tornado Cash, a privacy tool on the Ethereum blockchain that they say has been used to discreetly raise funds for North Korean regime. Some lawmakers and former regulators have suggested U.S. regulators\u2019 actions amount to a deliberate attempt to isolate crypto from the traditional banking system, mirroring a previous \u201CChoke Point\u201D crackdown on gun businesses.","Read more: European Banking Regulator Calls Attention to Digital Ledger Technology","Edited by Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"European Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"European Banking Authority","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"EBA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"August 31","content":"DATE"},{"type":"European Banking Regulator Calls Attention to Digital Ledger Technology","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Money Laundering","EU Commission","European Banking Authority"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
