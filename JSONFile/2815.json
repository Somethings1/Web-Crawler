One investor in BAYC creator Yuga Labs, the $4 billion startup, blames traders.","BAYC\u2019s floor price \u2014&nbsp;the price of the cheapest item in an NFT collection \u2014&nbsp;dropped below 34 ETH ($64,000) for the first time since November 2021, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/art-collectibles\/floor-price-of-art-and-collectibles-nfts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to The Block Research data<\/a>. That coincided with a period of heavy selling.","Some attributed the crash to the actions of rapper-turned-NFT enthusiast Jeffrey Huang, otherwise known as Machi Big Brother, <a href=\"https:\/\/nftevening.com\/bored-ape-yacht-club-faces-wild-ride-as-machi-big-brother-initiates-massive-sell-off\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">who suddenly offloaded 50 apes<\/a>. Huang has recently drawn the ire of crypto Twitter over <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/machibigbrother\/status\/1670819142050652160?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suing blockchain sleuth ZachXBT<\/a> for defamation.","But Lior Messika, who runs crypto venture firm and Yuga Labs-backer Eden Block, sees rife speculation as the bigger driver of the decline in BAYC prices.","\u201CThe NFT market of today rewards traders and speculators, not builders utilizing the underlying IP in creative and valuable ways,\u201D said Messika, whose fund <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234453\/crypto-vc-eden-block-hires-former-goldman-sachs-partner-orit-freedman-weissman\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recently hired<\/a> the former CEO of Goldman Sachs in Israel. He added that NFTs are highly risky assets and often \u201Cfirst to suffer\u201D in volatile markets.&nbsp;","A driving force behind that shift in dynamic is Blur, the Paradigm-backed platform built for pro traders. Since October last year, Blur has dominated an otherwise suppressed NFT market \u2014&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/marketplaces\/share-of-nft-marketplace-volume\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">today accounting for 66% of volumes<\/a>, compared with OpenSea\u2019s measly 10%, according to The Block Research data.","\u201CSome will blame Blur and some will blame the lack of royalties, but the situation is simple: a trader\u2019s market is repricing the cultural and utilitarian aspects of BAYC, and that situation won\u2019t change \u2014 not until new capital enters the NFT space (and the BAYC collection) for the right reasons,\u201D Messika said.","He added that where once NFT whales identified as \u201Ccollectors,\u201D they are increasingly branding themselves as traders or even \u201CBlur farmers\u201D \u2014 a reference to the rewards customers can earn in the platform\u2019s token.","\u201CSadly, the market is now dictated by the fear and greed of a few traders, and collectors across the space are struggling to find footing in this new reality,\u201D Messika added.","At its all-time high a little over a year ago, BAYC\u2019s floor price stood at 128 ETH ($240,000), with individual items selling for millions of dollars. Messika thinks Yuga is unlikely to do much in response to recent price pressure, however.","\u201CYuga\u2019s building a place for those collections and underlying communities to grow through utility and unique experiences. I believe that in the long term, this approach will lead to the best outcome for their collections as they expand their market. The best thing that Yuga can do to react to negative price movement is simply ship,\u201D he added.","Yuga Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/nft-non-fungible-tokens\/art-collectibles\/floor-price-of-art-and-collectibles-nfts\/embed\" title=\"Floor Price of Popular NFTs\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
