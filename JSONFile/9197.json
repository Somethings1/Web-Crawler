It argues that, if necessary, the community should possess the ability to migrate to a new network.","This comes at a time when the zkSync network is still centralized. Currently Matter Labs still runs the prover and sequencer on its network. It has said that it plans to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222596\/zksync-era-first-zkevm-goes-live-in-major-development-for-ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">decentralize<\/a> the sequencer. Yet the manifesto outlines that this broader journey will take some time.","\u201CRealizing these principles requires time and perseverance. A steady, pragmatic approach to decentralization is needed,\u201D it states.","Beyond this, the manifesto outlines eight principles that it deems crucial. These include basic decentralization tenets like censorship-resistance and trustlessness.&nbsp;","Yet it includes three principles that it argues are not met by Ethereum. These are privacy, accessibility and hyperscalability.&nbsp;","The manifesto claims that zero-knowledge technology, used by zkSync, can help it achieve all of these goals. Zero-knowledge proofs are able to increase privacy and throughputs on a blockchain network.","Matter Labs suggested that other networks could adopt the ZK Credo.","Â© 2023 The Block.
