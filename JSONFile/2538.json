Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison stepped in on Twitter, offering to purchase the tokens from Binance for $22. Markets reacted negatively, and the price of FTT plummeted. Shortly after, CZ confirmed Binance made a significant transfer of FTT.","In the days since, FTX's inability to operate without fresh capital has come to light. Binance stepped in ostensibly to acquire the exchange, but following initial due diligence, backed away from the deal.&nbsp;","Markets are wrought with uncertainty and prices continue to fall.
