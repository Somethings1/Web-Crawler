The funding was realized via a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) sale, they said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The project aims to allow users to stake tokens while providing liquidity to DeFi protocols in parallel. <\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Say, for example, if you had ether and all of that ETH was being used to secure the Ethereum network and was also being able to be used within DeFi protocols such as Uniswap and MakerDAO,\" Smokey the Bera said in an interview. \"That's really a powerful unlock.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Berachain has a tri-token system of bera (the native gas token), honey (a native stablecoin) and BGT (the \"non-transferrable\" Bera Governance Token). Users who stake bera or \"other permissioned tokens\" will earn BGT over time, allowing them to \"capture honey generated by the underlying chain architecture as a reward for their participation in governance,\" Berachain said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Berachain network is being built on the Cosmos SDK, using a \"proof of liquidity\" consensus mechanism, and will be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The Berachain ecosystem claims to have already had $250 million in committed total value locked.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Berachain is the pseudonymous co-founders' second project, after the NFT project Bong Bears, a collection of \"100 absolutely zooted NFT bears getting baked.\" Investors who purchased a JPEG of a bear for 0.069 ETH in August 2021 received the right to claim follow-on collections \u2014 called Bond Bears, Boo Bears, Baby Bears, Band Bears and Bit Bears \u2014 free of charge. These collections have exceeded $20 million in secondary volume across marketplaces, said Berachain.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Smokey the Bera said they and the other co-founders have known each other for several years and have previously worked in industries including health care, venture capital and tech.
