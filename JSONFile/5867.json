The Supreme Court explained in the ruling that the decision is in line with China\u2019s overall strategy of discouraging the energy-intensive crypto mining activities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But Streng declined to specify the current status of the equipment and whether the hardware is in transit to Genesis Mining\u2019s facilities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Genesis Mining was founded in 2013 by Streng and Marco Krohn as a cloud mining business with facilities in Iceland, selling their hash rate to global customers. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/why-we-launched-genesis-digital-assets-marco-streng\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In 2017<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, Streng and Krohn started a self-mining business together with new partners Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, Andrey Kim, and Rashit Makhat.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That self-mining business had no brand at the beginning and it was only until earlier this year that the five partners formally launched it as Genesis Digital Assets. This took place as the firm sought funding and later closed a $125 million round. The self-mining entity said on its website that it has 143 megawatts of capacity with a total bitcoin hashrate exceeding 2.6 EH\/s as of July 31.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Around the time when Streng and Krohn expanded into the self-mining business, they also entered into a hosting deal for Genesis Mining with a Chinese data center provider in the city of Fuzhou, Jiangxi province, called Chuangshiji Technology Limited.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Per the Supreme Court\u2019s description of the events, Chuangshiji abruptly suspended the payouts to its hosting client starting in September 2018 based on accusations that Genesis Mining failed to pay its power bills.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Genesis Mining filed a lawsuit in May 2019 to the Fuzhou Municipal Intermediate People's Court demanding the return of 560,000 units of its GPUs as well as 60,580 units of the AntMiner S9 bitcoin ASIC miners. The firm accused Chuangshiji of failing at its obligations and embezzling the miners. Genesis Mining said it had decided to terminate the hosting relationship but Chuangshi refused to return the miners while starting to sell some of the equipment.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The case was trialed in the Fuzhou Intermedia Court and Chuangshiji appealed it to the Jiangxi Provincial Higher People's Court, which issued a judgement in 2020.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The higher provincial court ordered Chuangshiji to return 100,000 GPUs to Genesis Mining\u2019s mainland Chinese subsidiary and to return 385,681 GPUs to Genesis Mining\u2019s Hong Kong entity.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But Chuangshiji petitioned the Supreme People\u2019s Court with what it claimed to be new evidence, asking the top judiciary body in China to review the case.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Supreme Court denied the review petition and sided with the Jiangxi Higher People\u2019s Court earlier this year.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Supreme Court said Chuangshiji failed to provide any new evidence that could support a claim that the relationship between it and Genesis Mining was an equity- and profit-sharing joint venture. Rather, the court believed it was clearly a contractual business relationship.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Therefore, the court said both Genesis Mining and Chuangshiji should have the right to terminate the relationship at any time. After the termination, Genesis Mining had the right to demand the return of its equipment, which are still operating and are in a good physical condition for the return, according to the decision.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe operation of the Fuzhou data center and the hosting and maintenance of the equipment involved in this case is essentially an activity of using high efficiency computers to win virtual currencies rewards. It\u2019s an energy intensive industry that is discouraged by the State. Thus the Jiangxi High Court\u2019s ruling in favor of terminating the business relationship is in line with the State\u2019s adjusted strategy over the industry involved in this case,\u201D the Supreme Court explained.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chuangshiji couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Read the full two rulings below:<\/em>","<a title=\"View Genesis Mining Limited v.s.
