A new bill proposes a voluntary path for that","category":["Regulation"],"content":["New legislation has been proposed that, if passed, would create an opt-in pathway to regulate U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges under a new, national-level framework.","The Digital Commodity Exchange Act (DCEA) endeavors to \u201Cregulate the trading venues which list emerging digital commodities, such as Bitcoin, Ether, their forks, and other similar digital assets, for trading.\u201D&nbsp;The wide-ranging legislation \u2014 introduced by Representative Michael Conaway \u2014 is the first of its kind to emerge from Congress, which to date has largely focused on adding definitions for digital assets to the federal code.","At the center of the bill is a proposed designation for crypto exchanges: a registered Digital Commodity Exchange, or DCE. Under the auspices of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), such a designation would exist alongside classifications for Swap Execution Facilities and Designation Contract Markets. What\u2019s more, the designation would offer an alternative to the state-by-state, money transmitter-centric approach that prevails today. The CFTC has considered cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to be commodities<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/cftc-ruling-defines-bitcoin-and-digital-currencies-as-commodities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> since 2015<\/a>.&nbsp;","Conaway told The Block in a statement:","As Peter Van Valkenburg, director of research for the D.C.-based Coin Center, highlighted in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coincenter.org\/two-new-bills-in-congress-would-clarify-agency-jurisdiction-over-cryptocurrency\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blog post<\/a> published Thursday, U.S.-based exchanges \u201Care free to continue relying on state money transmission licenses or state bank and trust charters; choosing CFTC regulation would be an optional alternative path.\u201D","\u201CIf an exchange applied and was approved, then it would no longer be subject to state-by-state money transmission licensing requirements,\u201D he continued.","Conaway\u2019s office framed the voluntary path as the one with a better approach compared to the current state of affairs. \u201CTrading venues will be incentivized to choose CFTC regulation in order to reduce their regulatory burdens by facing only one regulator, be eligible to offer leveraged trading, and be the point of entry for new digital commodities to the retail public.\u201D As noted in the actual legislative text, such exchanges would not be able to offer derivatives under the DCE registration alone.","That latter element \u2014 the introduction of new assets \u2014 also forms part of the DCEA. As before, the bill is trying to draw a line of demarcation between things that fall under the remit of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 that is, digital assets that are securities \u2014 and digital commodities akin to bitcoin and others.","The legislation lays out how a \u201Cdigital asset presale\u201D can be conducted, with such assets sold to accredited investors. Indeed, if the approved, DCEs would ultimately be able to offer trading for such presold tokens.","Another key facet of the bill: exchanges regulated in this fashion would only be allowed to list digital commodities that \u201Care not readily susceptible to manipulation.\u201D","As the text outlines:","The bill outlines how such exchanges would be required to have safeguard measures in place, shielding customers from potential harm and manipulation on their trading venues. It also includes language about information reporting requirements for DCEs and procedures for a potential wind-down, including how much financial resources a DCE must have on hand at a given time.","On the question of asset custody, the bill also provides for certain firms to be designated \u201CQualified Digital Commodity Custodians,\u201D for which the CFTC would \u201Cset minimum standards for supervision and regulation a regulator would have to impose for an entity regulated under the regime to be deemed \u2018qualified.\u201D","In sum, Conaway\u2019s bill attempts to cast a wide net and, if successful, would represent a novel framework and provide the kind of regulatory clarity that many U.S. crypto businesses have long sought.&nbsp;","\u201CThis one bill addresses all three of these policy issues: the need for a federal alternative to state licensing, the need for clarity over SEC jurisdiction, and the issue of cryptocurrency price manipulation and the need for spot-market supervision,\u201D Van Valkenburgh wrote.","It should be noted that the timing of the bill \u2014 coming at the end of a Congressional session amid a presidential election year \u2014 virtually assures that it won't be passed during the calendar year. But Conaway's office told The Block that industry businesses and stakeholders weighed in on the measure during its drafting, signifying that there's momentum behind it and that it may see success in the next Congress.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The draft text of the legislation can be found below:<\/em>","&nbsp;","<a title=\"View Draft Bill2 on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/477334244\/Draft-Bill2#from_embed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Draft Bill2<\/a> by <a title=\"View MichaelPatrickMcSweeney's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/user\/265494999\/MichaelPatrickMcSweeney#from_embed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MichaelPatrickMcSweeney<\/a> on Scribd","<iframe id=\"doc_94961\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Draft Bill2\" src=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/embeds\/477334244\/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-fqmwy6GZRccNLoOg8GC0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.75\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>"],"hashtag":["CFTC","CONGRESS"]}
