It uses orb devices to scan people\u2019s irises to help them prove they\u2019re real people online \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241074\/sam-altman-worldcoin-launches-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">and distributes its WLD token to those who sign up<\/a>.","In blog posts published this morning, the Worldcoin Foundation, a non-profit that aims to steer the network\u2019s future development, unveiled a grants program, a \u201CWorldcoin Tech Tree\u201D and a whitepaper on decentralization. \u201CTo become part of the global digital infrastructure Worldcoin must be as robust, widespread and neutral as the internet itself,\u201D the foundation said in the post. \u201CAny lesser standard is insufficient to effectively address the grand challenges. This has been a priority from day one, and much has already been achieved.\u201D","Tools for Humanity, a for-profit, San Francisco-based company that has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/232172\/worldcoin-developer-announces-115-million-fundraise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised hundreds of millions of dollars from venture capitalists<\/a>, has spearheaded most aspects of the Worldcoin project to date.&nbsp;","The news comes just a few weeks after Altman was ousted from his role at ChatGPT-creator OpenAI before being reinstated. OpenAI\u2019s status as a non-profit was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2023\/nov\/28\/artificial-intelligence-openai-non-profit-money\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reportedly a key sticking point<\/a> in the dispute. &nbsp;&nbsp;","TFH\u2019s CEO Alex Blania said in an interview with The Block that the timing of the foundation\u2019s announcement today was purely coincidental.","In its blog posts, Worldcoin said it hopes to achieve \u201Cdistributed robustness\u201D \u2014&nbsp;in the way that TCP\/IP, WiFi or the English language have. Three areas it will focus on for achieving that are the decentralization of orb production, meaning independent teams will begin manufacturing them; new forms of distributed governance; and balancing its emphasis on robustness with the need for privacy. &nbsp;","The foundation\u2019s first grant program has an initial pool of $5 million to award to developers, with grants denominated in WLD. They can be dished out in chunks of up to 5,000 for community grants, up to 25,000 for projects and there are also open-ended grants for the most ambitious initiatives.","\u201COne of the sexiest items in the grants program is to become a second manufacturer of orbs and spin up an entire factory,\u201D Remco Bloemen, head of blockchain at Worldcoin, told The Block. \u201COne step further would be that you actually design your own orbs in-house.\u201D&nbsp;","He added that scaling is another priority area for the grants program, after Worldcoin found itself considerably constrained during its token launch on OP Mainnet. \u201CWe broke the chain at launch. We had way too many users,\u201D Bloemen said. \u201CWe\u2019re already hitting the limits of what L2s have to offer.\u201D","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
