Both groups ended up paying high MEV rewards to ensure their transactions were accepted into new Ethereum blocks as soon as possible.","In an act of ethical hacking, an MEV bot operator, identified by the ENS name \u2018c0ffeebabe.eth\u2019, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/242136\/mev-bot-runner-c0ffeebabe-eth-returns-5-4-million-amid-curve-exploit?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">returned<\/a> 2,879 ETH ($5.4 million) back to Curve Finance.
