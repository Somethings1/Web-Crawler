Two of the largest, Core Scientific and Compute North, have filed for bankruptcy.","\u201CWe may see hosting providers push for pass through power contracts plus a spread, while also offering clients certain revenue curtailment benefits,\u201D Galaxy said.","Notably, Core Scientific and Celsius Mining were in dispute over the terms of their agreements relating to power cost surges, with the former ultimately getting the green light to turn off 37,000 Celsius mining rigs.","Network hash rate also will end the year up 23% at 325 EH\/s, the firm said in its year-end report on mining.","Miners have been forced to sell assets and turn to bankruptcy amid a drop in bitcoin prices and a surge in energy costs, which have squeezed margins.","\u201CThe bitcoin mining industry is currently going through a purge of all of the excess and misallocations of capital that supported weak business models during the bull market of 2021,\u201D the bank said. \u201CMiners ended 2022 in survival mode, setting the stage for more turbulent times ahead in 2023.\u201D","While over $1.1 billion in distressed mining funds has been announced, miners will still struggle to have the same access to funding that was available in 2021 and 2022. The structure of machine-backed loans is bound to change and going forward those loans will have to \u201Cinclude a better mechanism for determining monthly payment amounts based on market conditions.\u201D","In 2022, miners defaulted on $277mm of ASIC-backed loans, handing back over 11.59 EH of machines to lenders, Galaxy estimated.","\u201CGoing forward, it is essential that miners develop a treasury management strategy that aligns with their future cash needs,\u201D Galaxy said. However, it added, \u201CIn 2023, we do not anticipate the same level of sell pressure coming from miners.\u201D","The firm notes that more than 1 GW of hosting capacity entered bankruptcy in 2022.","Â© 2023 The Block.
