Users staking ether with StakeStone receive STONE, a \"yield-bearing ETH\" token, which can be further utilized for additional rewards, Charles said. StakeStone is also exploring opportunities within the Bitcoin restaking ecosystem to introduce \"yield-bearing BTC (STONE BTC),\" he added.","Charles noted that StakeStone is not merely a liquid restaking protocol, as restaking serves as one of the platform's underlying strategies, with plans to support bitcoin and other assets in the future.","In recent months, Binance Labs has increased its support for startups in the restaking space. This year, it invested in the Bitcoin staking protocol <a href=\"https:\/\/mta-sts.theblock.co\/post\/279344\/binance-labs-bitcoin-staking-protocol-babylon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Babylon<\/a> and Ethereum restaking protocols <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/278564\/binance-labs-renzo-ethereum-restaking\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Renzo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/275102\/binance-labs-puffer-investment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Puffer Finance<\/a>.

Binance Labs staff contracts are now separate from employees of the crypto exchange, similar to the structure of the Binance-backed BNB Chain project, with few operational changes.","Last year, Binance Labs accepted its first external capital when it closed a $500 million fund. However, over the summer, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264198\/binance-labs-repaid-external-investors-capital-over-summer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">began<\/a> returning undeployed capital to limited partners.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
