The platform leverages WebAssembly (WASM)\u2014a binary code format tailored for traditional web and blockchain integrations.","Stellar\u2019s introduction of smart contracts aims to broaden the network\u2019s use beyond crypto payments to include decentralized finance (DeFi) and other financial services.&nbsp;","SDF has also allocated $100 million to a Soroban adoption fund to support development on this new platform. The fund has funded over 160 projects, focusing on leveraging Stellar\u2019s smart contract capabilities for various applications. Projects building on Stellar include bridge projects, Axelar, Allbridge, the Band Protocol oracle, and DeFi newcomers including Sworoswap and Blend.","Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim co-founded Stellar in 2014. It is an open-source blockchain network focused on enabling cross-border transactions.","Initially, Stellar operated on a system akin to Ripple since it was conceptualized as a fork. However, facing challenges and driven by the aspiration for a unique solution, Stellar introduced a completely revamped codebase with a renewed consensus mechanism termed the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP).","Although Stellar has supported smart contracts in the past, the core team has progressively focused on developing Soroban as a general-purpose and developer-friendly platform to deploy WASM-based high-performance dapps.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
