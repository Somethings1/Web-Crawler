The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/226817\/pepe-memecoin-rally\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Pepe the Frog\"-themed token pepe<\/a>, for example, saw an extraordinary surge short-term, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/226817\/pepe-memecoin-rally\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">skyrocketing<\/a> by over 266 times in just four days. The team behind the coin seemed to have enticed users to forsake popular dog-themed tokens like dogecoin and shiba inu in favor of the popular internet frog meme.","\"A spectacular price increase made people rush into memecoins like pepe, wojak and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/chad-coin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">chad<\/a> \u2014 all having a daily volume of $10 million to $100 million,\" said Simon Cousaert, director of data at The Block.","The prices of said memecoins have severely decreased since then, creating a feast for MEV bots. Short for Maximal Extractable Value, MEV is a technique that involves manipulating transaction sequencing to capitalize on profitable on-chain trades \u2014 such as arbitrage and re-ordering of transactions. \"The activity of inexperienced traders caused hugely profitable opportunities for MEV bots,\" Cousaert said.","As The Block reported last week, an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227110\/mev-trading-bot-memecoins-subway\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MEV trading bot operator who goes by \"jaredfromsubway\" spent<\/a> over $1.1 million on Ethereum network fees and earned about $700,000 in profits front-running tokens and memecoins.","The increased DEX trading activity also led to a surge in Ethereum gas fees to around 73 gwei on April 19, now down to about 43 gwei. (A gwei is one-billionth of one ETH.)","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The median gas price on Ethereum also surged last week.
