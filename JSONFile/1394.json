Kemba Walden, a lawyer for Microsoft who testified, noted the role that bitcoin and its pseudonymity played in many ransomware attacks.","\u201CThis technology does not cause criminals to commit these crimes,\u201D continued Walden. \u201CCompliant stakeholders within the crypto industry are just as eager as victims to eliminate the threat of ransomware.\u201D","While Philip Reiner, CEO of the Institute for Security and Technology told the subcommittee that \u201Cthe cryptocurrency sector must be better understood and more closely regulated,\u201D he also noted the findings of a ransomware task force on which he served were \u201Cnot necessarily that cryptocurrency is a problem.\u201D","The necessary expanding regulation, according to Reiner, was likely \u201Cexpanding application of KYC and AML rules that are already available.\u201D","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCyber hygiene\u201D<\/span><\/strong>","But just because crypto itself didn\u2019t seem to be in the crosshairs doesn\u2019t mean that the subcommittee wasn\u2019t on a mission.","For starters, there was a lot of talk of so-called \u201Ccyber hygiene.\u201D","Broadly, witnesses defined the term as some combination of the basics: multifactor authentication, employee training on identifying phishing attempts and segmenting of networks. From a policy standpoint, this included the need to expand cybersecurity spending within the private sector \u2014 a proposal that emerged with seeming bipartisan favor was a requirement for firms receiving government grant funding to spend a certain percentage of their budgets on cybersecurity.","These concerns were especially concentrated on health care and energy. \u201CI\u2019m here to tell you that healthcare is not prepared to prevent or respond to cyberattacks,\u201D said Christian Dameff, a professor in medical cybersecurity.","In addition to highly public attacks like the one against Colonial Pipeline, hospitals routinely find their systems bound up by ransomware.","Beyond internal considerations, cybersecurity has become a major area of international concern.","The White House began this week by spotlighting China as a malicious actor in cyberspace. The administration and many throughout Congress have spent the past several months associating the Putin regime in Russia with many of the world\u2019s biggest ransomware gangs.","\u201CWhile the Russian president Putin may not be directly connected to these attacks, he refuses to crack down on them,\u201D said Cathy Rodgers, ranking member of the full committee. \u201CWe know the Chinese government engages in malicious cyber behavior too.\u201D"],"hashtag":["CONGRESS"]}
