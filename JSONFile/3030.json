Signature Bank said the drop in net income is due to an increase in the provision for credit losses of $60.5 million.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe provision for the losses \"was wholly attributable to COVID-19,\" said the bank.&nbsp;","Signature Bank\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) for Q1 2020 also came in lower at $1.88. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehour.com\/business\/article\/Signature-Bank-1Q-Earnings-Snapshot-15220362.php\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Analyst estimates<\/a> (Refinitiv Ibes Data) were at $2.18 EPS. The bank\u2019s Q1 2019 EPS was at $2.63.","On a positive side, Signature Bank\u2019s net interest income for Q1 2020 increased by 9.2% at $348.3 million, as compared to the first quarter of 2019. \u201CThis increase is primarily due to growth in average interest-earning assets,\" said the bank.","The New York-based bank\u2019s deposits also grew by 15% to $42.24 billion in Q1 2020 as compared to Q1 2019, while average deposits grew by $1.1 billion in Q1 2020.","\u201CThis was the second-best quarter of deposit growth we ever reported,\u201D Joseph DePaolo, president and CEO of Signature Bank, said in an <a href=\"https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4339507-signature-bank-sbny-ceo-joseph-depaolo-on-q1-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">earnings call<\/a> on Thursday. \u201CMoreover, this is now the third quarter in a row of over $1 billion in deposits in both total and average deposit growth. Since the end of the 2019 first quarter, deposits have increased $5.6 billion and average deposits increased $4.7 billion,\u201D DePaolo added.","Looking at the bank\u2019s lending businesses, loans during Q1 2020 increased 5% to $41 billion as compared to Q1 2019. <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CThe increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by new fund banking capital call facilities. This is the sixth consecutive quarter where C&amp;I [commercial and industrial] outpaced CRE [commercial real estate] growth furthering the rapid transformation of the balance sheet to include more floating-rate assets and diversifying our credit portfolio,\u201D DePaolo said in the earnings call.","Signature Bank\u2019s pre-tax, pre-provision earnings also increased by 5% at $218.5 million in Q1 2020 as compared to $207.9 million for Q1 2019.","\u201CThe increase was predominately driven by substantial asset growth of $4.5 billion offset by the investments we made in business initiatives including our West Coast expansion,\u201D said DePaolo.","Signature Bank hired new leadership in the West Coast in Q1 2020 and onboarded private client banking team, said DePaolo, adding: \"As go through the next several years I'd like to see the West Coast take over the East Coast.\u201D","Notably, the Q1 2020 results did not provide details on Signature Bank\u2019s blockchain-based payments platform Signet. It remains unclear how many clients the bank onboarded to Signet and what was the platform's transaction volume in the quarter. The Block has reached out to the bank and will update this story should we hear back."],"hashtag":[]}
