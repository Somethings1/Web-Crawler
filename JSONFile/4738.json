Blockvest, S.D. Cal., 8CV2287-GPB(BLM), February 14, 2019, \u201COrder Granting Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Partial Reconsideration\u201D [SDP]<\/strong><\/em>","It ain\u2019t over til the curtain falls\u200A\u2014\u200Athis is true on Broadway and in litigation. This case is a, um, case in point. The SEC had a bad day in enforcement litigation back in November, 2018, when a federal judge in California declined to enter a requested preliminary injunction, finding that there were fact questions at issue as to whether or not the token at issue was a security under the Howey test. [For more on this earlier opinion, see <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/crypto-caselaw-minute\/crypto-caselaw-minute-12-11-29-2018-b9c4308ee8c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">here<\/a>]. Today, the same judge reconsidered its prior order and granted SEC\u2019s Motion for Partial Reconsideration.","You can read a summary of the case in our prior post, but here\u2019s some quick context: the SEC sued defendants alleging that they were offering and selling unregistered securities in the form of something called BLV tokens. Defendants claimed that their ICO had been approved by the SEC, CFTC and National Futures Association, and had their logos on their site. They also made up an agency called the \u201CBEC\u201D and put that on their site for good measure.","While Federal Judges usually don\u2019t change their mind, you can ask, and that\u2019s what the SEC did here. A motion for reconsideration is granted if there\u2019s new evidence, the decision was clearly wrong\/manifestly unjust, or the law changed. The Court said here that reconsideration made sense based on a showing of the Defendants\u2019 prior securities violations and new evidence showing they might violate the law in the future.","Under the three-pronged Howey test, the Court concluded that promotional materials on Defendants\u2019 website, along with their whitepaper and social media accounts constituted an offer of unregistered securities, even if no sale was consummated.","First, the invitation to potential investors \u201Cto provide digital currency in return for BLV tokens satisfies the \u2018investment of money\u2019 prong of Howey. Second, the website promoted a \u201Ccommon enterprise\u201D because it said that funds raised would be pooled and a profit-sharing formula would be used for payouts. Third, and finally, promotional materials said investors would be \u201Cpassive\u201D and would receive \u201Cpassive income.\u201D Thus, under Howey, the Court said that this is a security","The Court also concluded that website and whitepaper materials made available to the general public were enough to show that there was an offer, even if performance wasn\u2019t necessarily possible. In short, this was, per the Court, enough to demonstrate a \u201Cprima facie\u201D violation of securities law\u200A\u2014\u200Aan offer to sell unregistered securities.","Defendants argued that, even if this were all true, an injunction wasn\u2019t necessary because it concluded it was unlikely the wrong would be repeated because Defendant had hired counsel, admitted that mistakes had been made, and promised not to do an ICO. The Court disagreed. It questioned Defendants\u2019 creation of a fake agency (\u201Cthe BEC\u201D) used to mark the token on their website and, further, noted that Defendants\u2019 lawyers had moved to withdraw from the case because they didn\u2019t like things their clients wanted them to file (Rule 11 concerns, to be precise). Also, the Court said Defendants had apparently tried to file things electronically under the pretense that they were doing so as defense counsel, but the filings were rejected. The Court said that it had \u201Cconcerns about whether Defendants will resume their prior alleged fraudulent conduct.\u201D It doesn\u2019t take a whole lot of tea leaf reading to conclude that the Court was particularly bothered by defense counsel\u2019s departure, and the reasons for it. (If you liked the prior opinion maybe you\u2019d take the position that bad defendants make bad law).","Bottom line\u200A\u2014\u200Athis decision was heralded by some as an important SEC loss. Turns out \u2026 not so much.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
