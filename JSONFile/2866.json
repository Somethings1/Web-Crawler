Users can also purchase virtual land and in-game apartments on-chain.&nbsp;","\"What I think is so powerful about Worldwide Webb is that you can just dive straight into the game with your wallet \u2014 you don't have to download anything,\" said Webb.&nbsp;","In the next few weeks, the project will also release an upcoming game, titled Blockbusterz, where users holding NFTs from different collections such as CryptoPunks, BAYC or Doodles can face off against each other in battles tournaments \u2014 Webb is personally vouching for CryptoPunks to win out.&nbsp;","Webb made his name as a multimedia artist producing artwork that relies on social media APIs and other real-time data sources. As an artist, he's worked with Hello Kitty creator Sanrio, fashion brand Valentino and luxury car maker Mercedes Benz.&nbsp;","Webb is hoping to use those connections he's made to create bespoke gaming experiences in Worldwide Webb that offer an alternative to the simple branded NFT drop, which has <a href=\"https:\/\/adage.com\/article\/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news\/porsches-failed-nft-drop-lesson-brands-web3\/2465986\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">varying degrees of success<\/a>.&nbsp;","\"People aren't just buying into the brand with an NFT but they're actually engaging in a branded game which is an experience within Worldwide Webb that they can earn a [branded] NFT from,\" he explained. \"It's less about trying to create things for people and more about creating and rewarding loyalty.\"","Aside from involving brands in Worldwide Webb, the funding will also be funneled into expanding its team and integrating other chains in addition to Ethereum. Webb said that it's also in the early stages of creating its own standard for ERC-1155 and 721 token standards that it hopes can help solve the issue of who is entitled to royalties of NFT secondary sales.&nbsp;","Worldwide Webb's backing follows a flurry of funding for projects in the NFTs and gaming subsector \u2014 the most <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/research\/january-blockchain-funding-recap-209442\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">popular subsector<\/a>&nbsp;in terms of percentage of total funding since August 2021, according to The Block Research. Last month, crypto gaming platform Oh Baby Games&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/206950\/oh-baby-games-comes-out-of-stealth-announcing-6-million-funding-round\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a>&nbsp;a $6 million seed round as it emerged from stealth.
