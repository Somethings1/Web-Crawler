Taking advantage of a faulty price oracle that Era Lend relied upon, the attacker used the reentrancy exploit to further drain assets from the protocol.","Typically, view functions labeled as read-only are considered safe, often lacking reentrancy protection since they don\u2019t change the contract\u2019s state. The term \u201Cread-only\u201D indicates that the function merely performs a view action, such as calculating a token balance based on a third-party pool\u2019s supply. In this incident, the third-party was another decentralized exchange called SyncSwap. However, as this case demonstrates, these functions can be manipulated to siphon off substantial funds.","\u201CThe attacker altered the LP\u2019s price during the burn\/mint actions of SyncSwap, using its reserves to determine the LP price [on Era Lend],\u201D Lei Wu, co-founder and CTO of BlockSec, told The Block. \u201CAll projects that utilize the SyncSwap code should remain alert.\u201D","\u201CWe have detected and confirmed a cyber attack on our platform. We want to assure you that the attack has been contained, and the threat actor can no longer continue their actions,\u201D Era Lend said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/channels\/936926364391604245\/936938589055500368\/1133380816387452958\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/a> on Discord.&nbsp;","It clarified that only the USDC pool was compromised, while the security of assets other than USDC remains intact.","As a precautionary measure, the team advised users to refrain from depositing USDC for the time being. Additionally, borrowing operations on the platform have been temporarily halted, the team added.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
