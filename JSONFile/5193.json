This post addressed a set of perceived criticisms and fraudulent claims around The DAO and software company Slock.it\u2019s part in it. It also went further into his disconnect with the current state of Ethereum.","\u201CAs of August 15th, 2022, the 'blockchain' (or should I use the hedge-fund coined terminology 'distributed ledger'?) has turned into a circus of centralized NFTs, endless Ponzi schemes, illegal securities or turncoat sycophants pledging loyalty to the nearest regulator. I do not recognize myself in that space, not even one bit,\u201D he said.","Tual added that he now intends to focus on other technologies including mesh networks and software-defined radio communication.&nbsp;","In January 2014, Tual joined the Ethereum project as chief communications officer. He worked there until September 2015, when he left to create Slock.it, which created a framework for building DAOs in 2016. That year, a large community of developers took the framework, in coordination with Slock.it, and used it to launch what became known as The DAO.","The DAO was the first major attempt at a truly decentralized autonomous organization focused on crowdfunding. It attracted a lot of investment \u2014 up to 15% of all ether (ETH) in circulation at the time \u2014 before a bug in its code was exploited. The issue was so severe that the Ethereum blockchain ended up forking, resulting in the Ethereum we know today and Ethereum Classic.","Following the collapse of The DAO, Tual faded from the limelight but remained active in the Ethereum community. He left Slock.it in 2017 to create a crypto-focused incubator and continued running Ethereum events in London.","As for who exploited the bug in The DAO, Tual didn\u2019t provide any details, but noted that, \u201C<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the truth WILL out,<\/i> eventually.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
