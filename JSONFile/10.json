The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a fourth day in a row, the S&amp;P 500 declined 1% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.1%. In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 index fell 0.7%, and London's FTSE fell 0.67%.","Bitcoin moved higher on Thursday despite a pullback in global markets. Image: The Block.","The eurozone\u2019s key interest rate remained unchanged at 4%, the main refinancing rate at 4.5% and the marginal lending facility at 4.75%.","Today's decision means that interest rates across the eurozone will stay at their highest level in over two decades.","The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecb.europa.eu\/press\/pr\/date\/2024\/html\/ecb.mp240411~1345644915.en.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ECB said<\/a> it would only be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction if the central bank receives further evidence that inflation is converging to the target in a sustained manner.","PIMCO Portfolio Manager Konstantin Veit suggested that if incoming data, particularly concerning wages and profits, aligns with the scenario outlined in the March projections, the ECB will likely implement rate cuts in June.","In an email sent to The Block, Veit anticipated that once the ECB begins reducing rates, it will do so cautiously, opting for conventional 25 basis point steps.","The analyst observed that market expectations have adjusted to reflect a significant reduction in anticipated rate cuts and highlighted that market risks now lean towards fewer cuts. \"Risks are probably towards less cuts, mainly on the back of sticky services inflation, a resilient labour market, loose financial conditions and ECB risk management considerations,\" Veit said.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
