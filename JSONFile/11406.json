Our injunction was successful and the name has been returned to us,\u201D ENS said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ensdomains\/status\/1571683432144711680\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweet<\/a> on Monday.","The company behind ENS had filed a suit against web domain registrar GoDaddy for selling the domain name to a third party, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/168579\/company-behind-ethereum-name-service-files-lawsuit-over-domain-sale\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">previously reported by The Block<\/a>. The suit accused GoDaddy of breaching a domain name registration contract. According to the complaint filed by True Names, GoDaddy wrongfully deemed the eth.link domain registered by the plaintiff as expired, and then sold it to a third party.","The court granted True Names' motion for a preliminary injunction in the matter. As such, the court ordered the return of the eth.link domain to True Names. GoDaddy had previously sold the domain to Dynadot who then <a href=\"https:\/\/domainnamewire.com\/2022\/09\/07\/eth-link-domain-sold-for-852k-in-unique-situation\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sold<\/a> it to DeFi aggregator Manifold Finance. The complaint also names both Dynadot and Manifold.","ENS founder Nick Johnson told The Block that the company was pleased with the outcome. \u201CWe have won the legal complaint against GoDaddy with the court granting our request for preliminary injunctive relief,\u201D said Johnson, adding that the ruling ordered the return of the domain to True Names.&nbsp;The court ruling itself states: \u201CTo the extent ownership interest in the Domain has been sold or transferred away from Plaintiffs as the registrants, Defendants shall immediately transfer ownership in the Domain back to Plaintiffs.\u201D","However, Manifold Finance founder Sam Bacha told The Block that the matter had not, in fact, been settled. \u201CDNS Services were restored to ensure the domain value remains. DNS is still held in escrow per the injunction and has not been transferred to True Names. Once the court opens in the morning more information will be available after the court opens,\u201D said Bacha. DNS stands for domain name service.","Johnson addressed this, saying: \u201CThe eth.link domain has been returned to us fully pending the outcome of the court case. Should the case not be pursued the return would effectively be permanent.\u201D","\u201CWhile we cannot rule out the possibility of future litigation from GoDaddy or others over the name, at this time it is truly returned to us and users can resume use of the service,\u201D Johnson added.","The ENS founder said users can resume using eth.link without disruption. ENS owners use eth.link as a gateway to access their \u201Cdot eth\u201D (.eth) ENS address as a typical browser website. They do this by adding a \u201Cdot link\u201D (.link) to their .eth ENS on a browser tab, which causes the link to open as a normal page on a web browser.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
