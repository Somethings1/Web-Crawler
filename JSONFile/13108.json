Our experience doing user-generated content for almost 15 years is that it doesn\u2019t just start with a blank page and saying \u2018use it,\u2019 you always have to seed a community of creators to see what the possibility is and then from there, people will be inspired,\u201D he said in an interview.","Last year, there were reports of dwindling users on metaverse platforms, which prompted leaders to set the record straight about how many users they actually have. In <a href=\"https:\/\/blockworks.co\/news\/metaverse-platforms-set-the-record-straight-about-daily-active-users\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">October<\/a>, The Sandbox said it has 201,000 monthly active users, 4.1 million total wallets, 128 million in staked SAND tokens and more than 22,200 land owners.","Borget thinks that through this audience the virtual world will start seeing an influx of individual creators releasing content \u2014 not attached to brands \u2014 in the next 12 to 24 months. This will be orchestrated through more community-focused curated events and through the creation of a DAO, which is expected to happen by the end of the year.","\u201CNo matter how good the technology is, without fun, storytelling and being relevant to the audience and creator friendly, the metaverse is less likely to succeed,\" he said.&nbsp;","So far, decentralization of the platform has come through its SAND token and the sale of virtual, blockchain-backed land via that token. Sand will dictate governance in the DAO. Centralized curation decisions and grants from the foundation will therefore be put in the hands of the community.","\u201CThe Sandbox will be at the service of the community, as just one holder of the token,\u201D he added.&nbsp;","Borget isn't just looking at growth online \u2014 he has IRL expansion on his mind, too. He wants to understand how the platform can fit into different cultures so it can attract different kinds of users.","A recent meeting with Saudi Arabian leaders sparked a rally in the price of SAND. The company also netted a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/144813\/dubais-crypto-regulator-to-launch-metaverse-headquarters-in-the-sandbox\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">partnership with Dubai<\/a>, which uses The Sandbox as its \"metaverse headquarters.\"","\u201CFive years ago, Saudi Arabia was still a country where music was forbidden. It\u2019s progressively opening to the rest of the world and has a very young population, which is interested in gaming and mobile gaming,\" explained Borget.&nbsp;","Borget is optimistic about the phase of education that is currently in progress in the region.","\u201CI don\u2019t see a world in 2030 or 2050 where the Middle East isn\u2019t playing a big part,\" he added.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
