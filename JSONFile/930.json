The network effects are undeniable, meaning expanded access to unified blockspace.\"","Manta Pacific aims to simplify ZK dapp development, eliminating the need for developers to grapple with complex cryptography. With its Universal Circuits library, Ethereum Solidity developers can enable ZK features in their privacy-centric DeFi and web3 applications with just a few lines of code.","Manta Pacific already hosts zero knowledge-circuit-enabled applications, including the on-chain game zkHoldEm, verified credential protocol zkMe and data verification protocol zkPass.","\"As core devs building ZK tech, it is important to align Manta Pacific\u2019s best-in-class ZK ecosystem with all the upsides of ZK infrastructure \u2014 and to do so in the EVM-equivalent environment of the Polygon CDK, which means existing dev tooling works out-of-the-box,\" p0x labs added.","Manta Pacific's transition to becoming a zkEVM validium is the first step toward its full mainnet, with an integration with Celestia's data availability layer to reduce transaction fees and information on the mainnet launch specification expected over the coming weeks.","Layer 2s already being developed using the Polygon CDK include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/221420\/polygon-to-help-develop-immutable-zkevm-secured-by-matic-stakers)\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Immutable zkEVM<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238140\/idex-unveils-a-zkevm-layer-2-chain-based-on-polygon-supernets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">IDEX<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241693\/palm-network-polygon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Palm Network<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/250505\/astar-network-zkevm-ethereum-layer-2-polygon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Astar zkEVM<\/a>.","Polygon Labs proposed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235698\/polygon-labs-proposes-to-upgrade-flagship-sidechain-to-zkevm-validium-layer-2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">upgrading<\/a> its own flagship Polygon PoS sidechain to become a zkEVM validium in June.","Clarifying the distinction between the validium and existing zkEVM technologies at the time, Nailwal told The Block that \u201Cthis is an upgrade of the Polygon PoS chain to a zkEVM 'Validium'.
