SBF&#x27;s prosecutors are not.","webName":"theblock.co","link":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255359\/sbfs-prosecutors-seek-to-forbid-any-mention-of-anthropic","publishDate":"2023-10-09T00:03:45","id":5341,"type":null,"title":"SBF\u2019s prosecutors seek to forbid any mention of Anthropic","category":["EXCHANGES"],"content":["Recent media reports that AI startup Anthropic will receive billions in fundraising from Google, just weeks after announcing a similar investment from Amazon, has led to <a href=\"http:\/\/for a substantial financial recovery\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">widespread optimism<\/a> from the creditors of FTX for a substantial financial recovery, given ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's investment in the company.&nbsp;","Yet one party is less than thrilled: the prosecutors in Bankman-Fried's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/tag\/sbf-trial\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ongoing fraud trial<\/a>. Late Sunday night, Assistant US Attorney Thane Rehn <a href=\"https:\/\/storage.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940\/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.315.0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> a motion asking Judge Lewis A. Kaplan to forbid Bankman-Fried from bringing up Anthropic in his trial.","Rehn cited an earlier circumstance in which Judge Kaplan ruled, \"It is immaterial as a matter of law whether [Bankman-Fried] intended to repay the misappropriated funds,\" and argued in his filing that \"such evidence would therefore be wholly irrelevant, and present a substantial danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, and waste of time.\"","Rehn also noted that venture capital investments are speculative, pointing to a familiar example. \"To take one salient example, FTX itself raised similar venture investments at valuations of around $18 billion in 2021 and around $32 billion in 2022 and yet today its shares are worth nothing,\" the filing stated.&nbsp;","The defense has yet to file a response. Bankman-Fried's trial will resume on Tuesday with the cross-examination of Alameda Research and FTX co-founder Gary Wang and potentially the first testimony of Alameda Research ex-CEO Caroline Ellison.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
