While many in the crypto community have cited BlackRock\u2019s record of just <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/EricBalchunas\/status\/1669691447996456963?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">one ETF denial<\/a> in its history as a positive indicator of a spot ether ETF approval, Chervinsky seemingly disagrees. \u201C\u2018BlackRock always wins\u2019 is a lazy bull take,\u201D the former Compound Labs General Counsel added.","In January, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WuBlockchain\/status\/1745312885298041012\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suggested<\/a> there was a 70% possibility for approval by May 23 \u2014 the final deadline for the SEC to rule on a spot ether ETF application from Ark and 21Shares, the first that was filed.","In response to Chervinsky\u2019s remarks, Balchunas <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/EricBalchunas\/status\/1763910750026793199?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> he and fellow ETF analyst James Seyffart would have new formal odds out soon. \u201CBut to be honest, and no offense to the Ethereum people but this is such small potatoes vs spot bitcoin ETFs. It's like the opening act coming on after the headliner. Using GenX bands it's like Sister Hazel trying to follow Nirvana,\u201D he added.","The ETF Store President, Nate Geraci, <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/NateGeraci\/status\/1764117615138496831?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">disagreed<\/a> with Balchunas. \u201CWill go out on a limb early and predict spot ether ETFs will be a bigger deal than everyone thinks,\u201D he said. \u201CSpot bitcoin ETF demand was also severely underestimated. Whether you like it or not, ether has 1\/3 market cap of bitcoin. The spot bitcoin ETF category is already approximately $50 billion. Basic math IMO.\u201D","\u201CYeah I\u2019ll stick with my Sister Hazel metaphor which is not saying ether and Hazel aren\u2019t popular but not in Nirvana\u2019s league. They sold 2 million albums to Nirvana's 75 million. [Bitcoin futures ETF] BITO has $2.5 billion. [Ether futures ETF] EETH has $25 million. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to get as into it\u2019s approval process vs bitcoin,\u201D Balchunas replied.","Ethereum educator and angel investor Anthony Sassano also <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/sassal0x\/status\/1764286627709616295?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">disagreed<\/a>. \u201CThis comparison makes no sense at all,\u201D he said. \u201CBITO launched at the pico top of the last cycle and EETH launched in the middle of the bitcoin spot ETF race (meaning that people assumed a spot ETH would be coming next).\u201D","Sassano suggested that a more appropriate comparison would be between Grayscale's products GBTC and ETHE, noting that prior to its ETF conversion on January 10, GBTC had $30 billion in assets under management, while ETHE stood at $7.3 billion.","Ikigai asset management founder Travis Kling <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/Travis_Kling\/status\/1764439769738510608?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">argued<\/a> that expectations were more concentrated around August than May, coinciding with BlackRock\u2019s deadline on August. 7. \u201CMakes sense and I agree that\u2019s the sophisticated take,\u201D Chervinsky replied. However, \u201CI just don\u2019t see anything changing in law, policy, or politics to make August more likely than May,\u201D he added.","Others <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/elliotrades\/status\/1764389561713721835?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suggested<\/a> that, as with the conversion of its GBTC fund to a spot bitcoin ETF, Grayscale may sue the agency if it denies a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/253885\/grayscale-ethereum-trust-spot-eth-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">similar application<\/a> for a spot ether ETF. \u201CMaybe. There\u2019s an argument for waiting to see who wins the election instead of spending time and money on litigation right away,\u201D Chervinsky wrote. \u201CRegardless, this SEC hasn\u2019t shown much fear of losing in court. Chair Gensler\u2019s view seems to be 'if we\u2019re not losing, we aren\u2019t aggressive enough.'\u201D","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
