It accepts assets such as ether, staked ether, and Dai as collateral.","Spark is expected to eventually become a subDAO, marking a significant step in MakerDAO\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.makerdao.com\/t\/the-5-phases-of-endgame\/20830\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">endgame plan.<\/a> A subDAO will be an independent decentralized autonomous organization within MakerDAO. As part of the endgame plan, several subDAOs, like Spark, are anticipated to be created \u2014 each governed by their own tokens.&nbsp;","The SubDAO tokens will be allocated to Spark borrowers, using various assets as collateral and distributed proportionately to the amounts and duration of borrowing. \u201CWe want to bootstrap a community of users and DAO participants that are aligned with the mission and potential of SparkDAO,\u201D Christensen wrote.","The goal is to incentivize Spark\u2019s active usage despite it offering a 5% yield \u2014 previously 8% \u2014 on Dai deposits, known as the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate, said Christensen.","The EDSR on Spark <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/243475\/makerdao-spark-dai-vpn\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">increased<\/a> to 8% earlier this week, leading to significant capital inflows as users leveraged borrowing arbitrage opportunities. Users borrowed Dai at lower rates and deployed it for higher yields in EDSR. Christensen later stated that the rate would come down to 5% as Dai deposits rapidly crossed the designated threshold on deposits.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
