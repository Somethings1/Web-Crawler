Token incentives will cause the Layer-2 (L2) ecosystems to amass a large TVL, and cross-L2 liquidity bridges will make the disadvantages over more centralized L1s more manageable. Optimistic rollups will be adopted much faster initially due to EVM compatibility. Still, eventually, composable ZK-rollups spearheaded by Starkware will be the winner due to better optimization, but adoption will be slow due to a new programming language.

With U.S. inflation at all-time highs of 6.8%, it does not remain viable to keep large Level I and\/or II securities on balance sheets that are generating negative yield. The first companies to implement DeFi and staking protocols will go down in history as adopters and champions of the future for how to properly optimize balance sheets. In 2021, we saw blue-chip household names like Visa buying NFTs and getting into digital assets. FinTech and payment services will also continue to shift towards digital asset adoption as on the retail side, digital assets lower the hurdle for access to lending, staking, payments, and traditional banking for the historically marginalized. While many institutions and TradFi participants remain skeptical, they can no longer ignore crypto as a legitimate asset class. In my opinion, many of them are neither bullish nor bearish, but simply want to adopt so as to \"not be left behind\" and for the inherent FX and inflation hedges. The largest hurdle to their entrance is driven by internal regulation, compliance and the necessary infrastructure they need to feel comfortable to either custody or hold on their own balance sheet.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While interest in other L1 blockchains continues, we will see a strong narrative being formed around Ethereum's ability to scale with further developed optimistic rollups as well as the proliferation of ZK-rollups (predominantly Starkware &amp; zkSync).&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum will also see increased institutional inflows compared to Bitcoin, primarily led by the shifting ESG narrative with the transition to PoS.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NFTs continually realize a utility scope outside of digital art, seeing a number of use cases that converge on traditional capital market instruments such as collateralized lending.

As a result, projects who bandwagon into \"gaming\" will struggle to match expectations.

As L2 scaling solutions like zkSync, Loopring, and Starknet launch, it will draw attention away from Ethereum mainnet.

In the process, capital will rotate back to \"blue chip\" NFT projects, such as Art Blocks or CryptoPunks. In addition, NFT trading activity will continue to proliferate across chains, bolstering the relative strength of burgeoning NFT ecosystems on other chains.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Notwithstanding their massive war chests, most blockchain gaming projects will underdeliver, shifting the narrative towards the notion that valuations have gotten ahead of fundamentals.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the battle for L2 scaling solutions, ZK-rollups will win out over optimistic rollups and gain more momentum.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin's hashrate reaches the 300 EH\/s level and over half of the Bitcoin network's hashing power will be located in North America.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There will be over 30 publicly listed Bitcoin mining companies by the end of 2022 and their equity or debt fundraise activities will continue to set new records in order to have additional working capital to pay for miner pre-orders. The dilution of their circulating stocks will hence continue. Some of the mining companies that have adopted a \"hold\" strategy so far will start to sell some of their bitcoin holdings or at least pledge them as collateral to borrow debts.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ETH2.0 will happen in 2022. Ethereum hashrate will continue setting new records after passing the 1 PH\/s threshold until a firm deadline for the proof-of-stake switch is decided. Before that actually happens, Ethereum will remain the top option for GPU mining. There will be a dump for graphic cards around the time of the switch on the secondhand market, but other proof-of-work coins could also see a big boost of hashrate. Ethash ASIC miners, on the other hand, will depreciate gradually and become obsolete unless the price of ETC surges in 2022 substantially to attract ETH ASIC miners.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Classic DeFi protocols will adopt the veToken model to attach greater use cases to their governance token. The basic premise is to lock the governance token to get advantages over people who don't lock up the token. This lock-up of tokens might cause these tokens to appreciate again after the relative DeFi bear market in the last few months. Projects like Convex have a chance to make use of this dynamic.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Infrastructure becomes increasingly important.

Of course, a decentralized NFT marketplace will take time to pick up volume and users, similar to how it took time for decentralized exchange like Uniswap to pick up traction and volume; however, usage will pick up once it does parabolically.<\/span>","Cross-chain bridges will continue to amass higher TVL as capital spreads to an increasing number of L1 and L2s. Bridge volumes will initially be fragmented across various bridges as users seek to move funds through the best liquidity sources, but volume will ultimately consolidate to a few bridges with the deepest cross-chain liquidity across the most popular chains. Alongside growing regulatory scrutiny and discussion, blockchains and applications with built-in privacy features will see increased usage and adoption. Protocols with a multi-chain focus like Cosmos and Polkadot will capture greater relative market share as the rollout of basic ecosystem infrastructure makes them more accessible to new and existing crypto users. Crypto becomes more mainstream than ever as NFTs see rapid adoption from the sports and entertainment industries. A crypto company buys the naming rights for an NFL stadium. NFT fractionalization will fade as a trend as no one wants to own a fraction of a rare NFT."],"hashtag":[]}
