ConstitutionDAO\u2019s shelf life is proving far shorter: just about one month.","The slapdash group of crypto investors that this month failed to buy a rare edition of the Constitution at Sotheby\u2019s will close its Discord server in 14 days.","\u201CWe have determined that building and maintaining an ongoing project is not something that we as a core team are able to support, given the technical and administrative requirements of doing it properly,\u201D a statement on ConstitutionDAO\u2019s website said. \u201CGiven this, we believe this project has run its course.\u201D","ConstitutionDAO is therefore shutting down, the post said, marking an end to the self-described \u201Cdecentralized autonomous organization\u2019s\u201D quixotic experiment in fundraising. Refunds of the group\u2019s $50 million war chest will continue in perpetuity; nearly 50% of funds have already been reclaimed.","Despite failing to meet its stated goal \u2013 the purchase of the U.S. Constitution at auction \u2013 the project\u2019s website administrated framed ConstitutionDAO as a \u201Clandmark\u201D achievement that showcased the power \u201Cinternet friends\u201D can have when they band together on super-tight deadlines.","Indeed, ConstitutionDAO drove unprecedented mainstream media interest in crypto-native governance concepts. And over 10% of wallets that donated to the project were first-timers, according to a dashboard on Dune Analytics. The median funding amount was 0.051 ETH.","But that minuscule figure now poses a problem for the masses who aped in, many expecting a token that was never delivered. Now they have nothing but a hefty gas bill to show for it."],"entity":[{"type":"Sotheby\u2019s","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Dune Analytics","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"$50 million","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Auction","NFTs","Sotheby\u2019s"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
