But it's missing key features of cash,\" said Elixxir president Jim Dolbear. \"What we are doing in supporting payments is much more like electronic cash in the same way that bitcoin is a store of value.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chaum is known as the father of the first digital currency, Ecash. His 1982 dissertation is also hailed as the inspiration of Satoshi\u2019s bitcoin white paper and the first known work that proposes a blockchain protocol. Chaum started a company in 1990 to implement Ecash. The company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/1998\/11\/digicash-outta-cash\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">went bankrupt in 1998<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although Ecash was short-lived, Chaum believes Praxxis will face a different fate. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Chaum, existing blockchain solutions are trapped in the so-called trilemma of blockchain where scalability, decentralization, and security cannot all be satisfied by a single protocol<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. Chaum said he believes it's time for people to break free from this old paradigm because blockchains designed under this model \"don't actually work.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf you want to create a religious war, then any deviation from the current paradigm would be considered unholy,\" said Chaum. \"But for years people have been promising scale, sidechains, sharding, but it's still not doing it.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The failure to address security, scalability, and speed at the same time has also been hindering cryptocurrencies from developing into a global transaction system, said Chaum. Praxxis, on the other hand, looks to break this deadlock and ensure user privacy by deploying the so-called \"denominated coin structure.\" The scheme breaks payments into smaller amounts and associates them with other payments, so only the user knows how much money he spends on each transaction.&nbsp;<\/span>","According to a Chaum, the Praxxis protocol is also quantum-resistant, meaning that the protocol can survive hacks generated by quantum computers. This means Praxxis could be bulletproof against regular cryptanalysis initiated by hackers and even government agencies. Chaum said the government standardized the encryption scheme that is widely adopted to secure digital information, including digital assets. However, this scheme is based on specific functions and could still be broken by the government. Instead, the Praxxis protocol <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201Cuses cryptography based on random function\u2026 then it is automatically quantum-resistant to a certain extent, and it's also resistant to conventional cryptanalysis.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To be sure, hash functions, which are the mathematical backbone of blockchains, are very difficult to reverse even with quantum computers. Although the private key encryption commonly adopted for cryptocurrency wallet solutions is prone to quantum attacks, hence the theoretical need for a quantum-resistant digital currency. <\/span>However, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crypto-textbook.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">perpetual tension<\/a> between computing power and cryptography dictates that a quantum-resistant solution may still be susceptible to future attacks as quantum computers advance.&nbsp;&nbsp;","For now, the technical details behind Praxxis are sparse, but the white paper is said to be released later this year.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chaum has been critical of, if not disappointed in the current development of blockchains in recently years.
