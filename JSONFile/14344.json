When will it end?","category":["CRYPTO ECOSYSTEMS"],"content":["If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s united members of the crypto community in recent months, it\u2019s the emergence of points.","Only they\u2019re not in favor of them, but dead set against them.","\u201CPoints are probably the stupidest detour crypto has taken in my time here. Also borderline scammy,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lex_node\/status\/1749910381928075379\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at Delphi Labs, on X.","This frustrated sentiment can be seen in the responses to new projects announcing their points programs. \u201CWow nice some points, how exciting. Imagine doing tokens when you could give points,\u201D sarcastically <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/0xG00gly\/status\/1749772190730391889\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">replied<\/a> one X user on Jan. 23 when crypto wallet Rabby revealed its new program \u2014 while others were <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gabrielhaines\/status\/1749780108519293245\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">even harsher<\/a> in their criticisms.","It\u2019s not hard to see why. Over the last few years, projects have rewarded loyal users and successful airdrop hunters with sudden issuances of tokens, often worth thousands of dollars \u2014 and sometimes in the regions of hundreds of thousands of dollars. For some, it can be life-changing money. Unsurprisingly, this phenomenon resulted in an entire ecosystem of airdrop hunters looking to cash in on the next big airdrop.","But points are antithetical to what the airdrop hunter is looking for. With airdrops, those who carried out some trades in the hope of an airdrop and got lucky when it arrived felt like they had beaten the system in some way \u2014 that their ingenuity, or sheer luck, had resulted in this unexpected windfall. Yet with points, users are obeying the system and being obedient, hoping that the system will look kindly upon them and reward their loyal actions with tokens some day. There's no edge to be gained and it\u2019s simply just not as fun.","Beyond this, points are more of an IOU that might never be delivered upon, just a number on a screen that harks back to the days of web2. They\u2019re not onchain, they can\u2019t be traded and they might not turn into any tokens. Most crucially, they\u2019re not worth anything \u2014 and maybe never will.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A visual take on the emergence of points.

But that's not true; in fact, it's the opposite. Users cannot be everywhere at once, and their attention gets diluted,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/long_solitude\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> Long Solitude, a pseudonymous investor at VC firm Zee Prime Capital, on X.","KVK, a pseudonymous investor director at VC firm HASH CIB, concurred that users have a short attention span and noted that most point programs lack a clear end date, making it worse.&nbsp;","\u201CIn a world where there is a protocol with a new point-based system every day, it is super hard to stay relevant over time,\u201D they said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/1n5734d0fu.substack.com\/p\/make-icos-great-again\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Substack post<\/a> devoted to points. \u201CAttention is one of the critical ingredients for success, and your quasi-infinite points program (from a user\u2019s perspective) does not help you capture it.\u201D","Out of curiosity, The Block tried to see how many points had been issued in total. As the points aren't on a blockchain, we had to download apps, check leaderboards and reach out to projects directly to get answers. In the end, we totaled up some 40.6 billion points across 12 projects \u2014 however meaningless that number is.","FriendTech is a clear example showing why users have been disaffected by points. The project was one of the first to implement a clear points system in its app in a bid to reward engagement. Each week it would drop points based on an unspecified allocation system to its users \u2014 something that worked brilliantly until it didn\u2019t.","During the project\u2019s first two months, it saw <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/tk-research\/friendtech\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$412 million of trading volume<\/a> as users bought keys that provide access to key influencers\u2019 group chats in the hope of reselling them at high enough valuations to offset the 10% tax on sales. Yet this quickly dwindled. Over the next three and a half months, it saw just a much slower $126 million of trading volume while the number of daily transactions collapsed.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The number of daily transactions on FriendTech has significantly reduced. Image: TK research via Dune Analytics.<\/span>","Part of the reason is that in the beginning, traders were optimistic that the points would lead to an imminent airdrop. At the time, a pseudonymous crypto influencer known as Dingaling \u2014&nbsp;who had one of the most expensive channels \u2014 said FriendTech would remain successful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252072\/friend-tech-users-have-earned-12-million-in-fees-but-is-it-sustainable\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">until the token airdrop<\/a>. When the project received investment from Paradigm, this spurred hopes that one was on the way.&nbsp;","Yet one has so far not taken place, and anyone who burned money hoping for a greater allocation has seemingly lost out.","While many retail investors complain about points, the one class of crypto investors that seem to like them is venture capitalists.","One key element is that points are more flexible than token issuance, which can\u2019t be changed on a whim. \u201CWhile points can't replace product-market fit, they provide the flexibility to test assumptions without the complexities and costs associated with launching tokens,\u201D Dmitriy Berenzon, partner at VC firm Archetype, told The Block.&nbsp;","Multicoin Capital Partner Tushar Jain agreed that points are useful for incentives prior to a token launch. \u201CLaunching a token is a lot of work, and it\u2019s much harder to change economics once the token is live,\u201D he said in the firm\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/multicoin.capital\/2024\/01\/16\/what-multicoin-is-excited-about-for-2024\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">outlook for 2024<\/a>.","A partner at VC firm Dragonfly, who goes by GM, said offering points enabled NFT marketplace Blur to fine-tune its incentives between seasons. Blur is currently on its third season of points. They added that Blur leaving some of the points criteria undisclosed helped it to avoid wash trading.&nbsp;","Edvin Memet, a researcher at The Block Pro Research, argued that airdrops with blind criteria tend to encourage more organic use, typically leading to larger allocations. \u201CAn airdrop with blind criteria may not attract as many users pre-airdrop, but it stands out as the fairest method for rewarding genuine users. Additionally, it is the most likely system to lead to substantial airdrop allocations, which can create a lot of publicity and attract new users post-airdrop,\u201D he said, pointing to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266735\/jito-token-witnesses-1-1-billion-of-trading-volume-in-first-day\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">liquid staking project Jito<\/a> as an example.","Memet noted that Manta\u2019s particular point-based system enabled it to attract a higher amount of value locked in its smart contracts than it would have received otherwise. The project also kept hold of the value by auto-staking ether that was bridged to it. He said he anticipates that other Layer 1 and Layer 2 projects will employ similar systems in the future.","Jain also noted that points help to avoid some of the regulatory risks seen with airdropping tokens because they don\u2019t have value. \u201CPoints have no units, no max supply, and less regulatory risk because they are not transferable,\u201D he said.","Some VCs are aware, though, that points may not have an infinite staying power.","\u201CI see it as a new narrative, a new thing, an exciting thing in crypto, but whether it is just a temporary fad is yet to be seen,\u201D Kavita Gupta, founder and general partner of Delta Blockchain Fund, told The Block. \u201CWe will definitely have everything continue to use point incentive systems, but I think it is more going to be about attracting customers than being able to retain them for a long time because everybody will end up giving some sort of features like this.\u201D","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
