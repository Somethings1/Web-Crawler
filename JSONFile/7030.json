The entire plan involves liquidating 20 million LDO tokens for dai stablecoin. Lido plans to sell half of this sum to Dragonfly Capital.","A previous vote last month was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/159521\/lido-dao-votes-no-to-selling-14-5-million-in-ldo-tokens-to-dragonfly-capital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blocked<\/a>&nbsp;by the community, with DAO members objecting to the terms of the token sale. These objections revolved around the quoted price for the token sale and the absence of any vesting requirement on the part of Dragonfly.","Lido Finance subsequently filed a revamped proposal that addressed these concerns, including two price ranges for the LDO token sale. The first price is based on the combination of a previous average spot price and a 50% premium that amounts to about $1.45 per coin while the second is based on a seven-day backward-looking average at the end of the vote. Dragonfly will buy the coins at the higher of the two prices. The venture capital firm can exit the deal if the higher of the two price benchmarks exceeds $2.25. Lido\u2019s revamped proposal also includes a one-year lock-up period for the tokens sold to Dragonfly.","<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hasufl\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hasu<\/a>, a pseudonymous advisor to Lido Finance and strategy lead at Flashbots, told The Block that the previous deal's structure was unpopular \u2014 and highlighted some of the unique problems associated with negotiating business deals with decentralized organizations like DAOs.","\u201CThe first proposal didn\u2019t have a contingency for the case that the LDO price increased after posting and that\u2019s why the vote predictably failed. The second proposal does have a contingency \u2014 the purchase price now moves up together with the spot price \u2014 and it also addresses another concern the community had around lockups,\u201D Hasu told The Block.","Â© 2023 The Block.
