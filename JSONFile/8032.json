In addition, the wallets Bitfy and Coins will also support the digital asset. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/analyzing-algorithmic-stablecoins-exploits-112840\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Algorithmic stablecoins<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> are designed to hold their peg to a currency automatically, instead of being backed by fiat money.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While Brazil already has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/115829\/brazils-public-instant-payment-system-pix-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">very popular<\/a> public instant payment system, called Pix, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/clabs.co\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CLabs<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> partner <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Markus Franke told The Block that the cREAL now provides a way to use complementary DeFi applications (CLabs is a \u201Cservice organization\u201D focused on developing and growing Celo projects). For example, Celo\u2019s DeFi applications could help enable new options for building up a credit history, he said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCelo is completely open-source, so there will be projects that will build a bridge from Pix to Celo transactions,\u201D Franke said. \u201DThere will be people who build lending and borrowing applications, so I think this is really, really nice.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Franke, Brazil\u2019s high penetration of smartphones and strong \u201Cgig economy\" make the country an interesting market for launching a stablecoin in local currency that is focused on mobile payments. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While most early stablecoins have been pegged to the U.S. dollar to help people avoid the volatility of their home currencies, Franke says there\u2019s now growth in those pegged to local currencies as well.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CNow, this is changing,\u201D Franke says, of stablecoins typically being pegged to the dollar. \u201CNow we see real end-users coming into the equation, using crypto not only for trading but also for transactions, for saving, for lending and borrowing, but also for payments for remittances. And now it makes a difference because people in these different countries actually have to maybe pay their merchants in local currencies, or pay taxes in local currencies.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Celo, the cREAL stablecoin can be used for both centralized finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on its blockchain, such as Moola Market for collateralized loans. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">People in Brazil can also load cREAL into their Bitfy wallet to pay for bills, food or merchants belonging to the network of leading Brazilian payment processor, Cielo.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
