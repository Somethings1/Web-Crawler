It now supports integrations with Binance, Huobi, OKEx, Bitfinex, Deribit, and Bitmex, with Coinbase on the pipeline.","\"The idea is, for instance, the spot bitcoin on OKEx can be directly used as margin for derivatives at Huobi without involving on-chain transactions,\" he said. \"When there's a significant market swing, you won't have to move around your collateral to meet margin calls on-chain, which can avoid potential network congestion.\"","CyberX was founded in 2016 by Wang, a former Goldman Sachs trader who co-founded crypto mobile wallet Bihang in 2013 together with Cobo Wallet's co-founder Jiang Changhao. Bihang was later acquired by OKEx.","The company began to offer prime brokerage services in 2019, and the existing core team boasts Wall Street and technology backgrounds, including Morgan Stanley, UBS,&nbsp; Merrill Lynch, Google, Baidu and Thomson Reuters.","Â© 2023 The Block.
