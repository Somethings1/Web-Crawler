It also sold 887 BTC in July, at an average price of $22,670 per coin.","The company used a majority of those revenues to reduce its bitcoin-backed loan with Galaxy Digital down to $6.72 million.

Argo held 1,295 BTC, of which 227 were BTC equivalents, as of 31 July.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/prices\/btc-price\/embed\" title=\"BTC Price\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Argo's quarterly results also revealed that the firm mined 22.4% more bitcoin in July (219 BTC), even though like other miners in Texas it curtailed power during periods of extreme heat.&nbsp;","The company did not disclose exactly how much power it had to curtail. But it claimed that miners in Texas had collectively reduced usage by over 1,000 megawatts at peak demand. Rival Riot said this week that curtailed power by 11,717 megawatt-hours (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/161226\/riot-mined-28-less-bitcoin-in-july-and-earned-9-5-million-in-power-credits\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">which earned it $9.5 million in power credits<\/a> from the state) in July.

It\u2019s like signing a mortgage when interest rates are really high. You have to wait for them to come down.\"","The CEO hopes the company will be able to negotiate a better PPA at a fixed price after power rates go down closer to the end of the summer, into September.","Argo's margin was 37% in July. \u201CNot a great margin, not where we wanna be and that should change in the future,\" Wall said.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
