Crypto Yield 2.0 is an indication of the shift from yield opportunities sourced through centralized intermediaries and subsidized DeFi platforms to those sourced \u201Cdirect-from-market\u201D in CeFi and DeFi. Mainstream access to these opportunities are growing quickly through improved platform tools, dApps, and education. CoinFLEX is pioneering this transition by building and developing the next iteration of Crypto Yield 2.0 opportunities.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What is Crypto Yield 1.0?<\/b><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What are some issues with Crypto Yield 1.0?<\/b>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What is Crypto Yield 2.0 about?<\/b>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">How will AMM+ drive forward Crypto Yield 2.0?<\/b>","<a href=\"http:\/\/coinflex.com\/amm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AMM+<\/b><\/a><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">: Leveling up the AMM model on a CeFi platform<\/b>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AMM+ Statistics&nbsp;<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The revamped AMM+ page now offers users a statistical summary they can easily reference to access relevant information when selecting a market pair.
