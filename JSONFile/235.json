He told The Block that after the creation of gold spot ETFs, \"trading volumes across a variety of gold instruments, ranging from the ETFs themselves to underline spot to futures and options, both OTC and listed, along with correlative proxies, increased by orders of magnitude over the years that followed.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He added that, under the right circumstances, a similar effect could happen to bitcoin.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Galaxy Digital Head of Firmwide Research Alex Thorn speculated how this could play out. \"An ETF could see a minimum of $14.4 billion of inflows in year one, ramping to $38.6 billion inflows in year three.
