But in order for it to become law \u2014 at least during this legislative session \u2014 a version of it has to pass in the state Senate before the session ends on June 2.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the moment, moving it through the Senate does not appear to be on the agenda. But that could still change.<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Senate version is currently in the Environmental Conservation Committee, which is meeting next Tuesday. And according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nysenate.gov\/calendar\/meetings\/environmental-conservation\/may-03-2022\/environmental-conservation-meeting\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">agenda posted online Thursday<\/a>, the moratorium bill will not be heard. As of publication time, the committee has not scheduled any additional meetings before the end of the legislative session.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It's still possible for the bill to make it to the floor if the Democratic majority leadership decides to move it. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The open question now is whether or not there is enough support among New York State senators to put the bill to a vote before the session adjourns.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThat discussion among the conference of majority Senators has not yet taken place,\u201D Democratic Senator Todd Kaminsky, the Chair of the Environmental Conservation Committee, told The Block. \u201CAnd I expect there to be a real robust discussion.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The bill has not been debated in committee or by the Senate majority, according to Kaminsky, so its future is largely unknown.<\/span>","The bill specifically calls for a moratorium on new permits for proof-of-work mining operations that use behind-the-meter electricity generated by fossil fuel, allowing the state time to act on a comprehensive impact study. <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Assembly passed it with a tally of 95 in favor and 52.<\/span>","But it has been drawn criticism from cryptocurrency advocates who have cast it as an anti-crypto ban. <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Assemblywoman Anna Kelles \u2014 a democrat and the main sponsor of the bill \u2014 has repeatedly insisted that it was not a ban and would only apply to a select number of fossil-fuel power plants.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Other Assembly members were concerned that it would send the wrong signal to the financial services sector in New York and drive miners away from the state. An earlier version of the bill, which called for a three-year moratorium on a broader scope of mining facilities, died in the Assembly in June of last year.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Senator Kaminsky said he\u2019s worried that even this scaled-back version could make New York look like \u201Can anti-crypto state.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think that it's important that crypto as a nascent but powerful industry be nurtured in New York,\u201D he said. \u201CWe want to find a way to get them to stay in New York and be green.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kaminsky argued that while there are \u201Cbad actors\u201D in the industry, that only represents a \u201Cvery small\u201D amount of the state\u2019s energy usage.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Parallel to the moratorium bill, there is another bill making its way through the legislature, sponsored by the same lawmakers, which calls only for a study on crypto mining with renewable energy. It is currently on the Senate\u2019s floor calendar and in committee in the Assembly.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI think if there is a bill that could help green the industry without hurting the industry and driving it out of New York it would be something I'd be very interested in looking at,\u201D Kaminsky said.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
