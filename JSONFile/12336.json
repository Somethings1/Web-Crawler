Brad Sherman, D-Calif., is seeing ghosts.","Sherman conjured the ghost of Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of failed crypto exchange FTX, during a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q14iLLkAImU\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hearing<\/a> focused on regulatory gaps in digital asset market structure on Thursday. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CHis ghost is still in this room. He haunts the halls of Rayburn,\u201D Sherman said, referencing the Rayburn House Office Building in which the hearing was held. \u201CBut let\u2019s remember why he was here. For one reason: To prevent the SEC from having jurisdiction over cryptocurrency.\u201D","Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, including bank fraud and illegal campaign contributions, that are tied to his role at the helm of FTX. Before his arrest, Bankman-Fried had pressed lawmakers to pass a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179270\/sam-bankman-fried-elaborates-dccpa\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">digital commodities regulation bill<\/span><\/a> and often visited Washington, D.C.","The Thursday afternoon hearing was held by the House Financial Services Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion. During his remarks, Sherman said that Bankman-Fried was seeking \u201Cbaby regulation\u201D for crypto through the Commodity Futures Trading Commission rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission.","\u201CAll the money and power in this town is on the pro-crypto side because crypto bros make money literally by making money and they\u2019ve made over a trillion dollars out of thin air,\u201D Sherman said. \u201CThey\u2019ll accuse the U.S. government of making money out of thin air. Maybe we do, but we\u2019re the U.S. government. What we\u2019re able to do benefits the American people in a democratic system. Nobody elected Sam Bankman-Fried.\u201D","A Bankman-Fried spokesperson declined to comment.","Later in the hearing, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., pushed back on Sherman\u2019s assertion that Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged crimes were specific to cryptocurrency, rather than more traditional fraud.&nbsp;","\u201CI found it interesting that now Sam Bankman-Fried is now the ghost of Christmas past. You know, what happened to FTX is unconscionable, never tolerated, but that\u2019s accounting fraud,\" Donalds said.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
