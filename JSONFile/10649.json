The vaults offer more distributed security compared to single-key hardware wallets, browser extensions or third-party custodians like crypto exchanges.&nbsp;","By requiring signatures from multiple devices for transactions, known as multisig, Casa helps keep funds protected even if a key is lost or compromised, eliminating concerns over theft, loss or exchange mismanagement. The company also offers additional resources and services to assist members in taking self-custody, including guided key replacement, personalized support and emergency recovery service \u2014 where Casa holds a backup key on their behalf.","\u201CThe digital asset revolution begins with self-custody,\u201D Casa CEO Nick Neuman said in a press release. \u201COur team designed Casa to help more people take control of their digital wealth, and we\u2019re thrilled to expand that opportunity for our members and the Ethereum community at large. Everyone deserves to know their assets are safe.\u201D","Casa has also updated its app, offering new membership <a href=\"https:\/\/keys.casa\/pricing\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">plans<\/a>, ranging from a standard plan with a three-key vault to a premium membership with a five-key vault for bitcoin and ether. Investors and families with substantial holdings can access digital inheritance planning services.","\u201CThe rollout marks Casa\u2019s first step into building a more comprehensive self-custody offering,\u201D Casa said in the release. \u201CIn recent years, it has become technically sound to implement Ethereum support via smart contract, which has dovetailed with market demand,\u201D the company added, referencing a <a href=\"https:\/\/grayscale.com\/learn\/2021-bitcoin-investor-study\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">recent survey<\/a> by crypto asset manager Greyscale that found 87% of bitcoin investors also have exposure to at least one altcoin.&nbsp;","The company said it was \u201Cgathering feedback on adding support for other ETH-related assets, such as NFTs, stablecoins and ERC-20 tokens,\u201D in the release.","\u201CWe always listen very closely to our community, and support for Ethereum was one of the most frequent requests from our members. Building a customer-first framework is at the core of what we do, so we will continue to take notice of what customers ask for,\u201D Neuman expanded in an emailed statement to The Block.","\u201CWhile users can initially secure only ETH and\/or BTC with Casa, we are taking a thoughtful and strategic approach in regard to what we choose to build next, and we are carefully evaluating what aligns with our technology and our privacy and security standards.\u201D","Casa <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/190825\/ethereum-storage-coming-to-custodian-casa-as-centralized-exchanges-lose-their-luster\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> its ether self-storage plans in November, expecting it would be available in Q1 shortly after launching a new app in January. The new app design was released in February, introducing vaults. Only now is the ether self-custody solution available for the first time.","\u201CWe had hoped to release it in Q1,\u201D Neuman told The Block. \u201COur customers have been excited for ETH support, and we were hoping to deliver it a bit earlier this year.\u201D","\u201CBut we are laser-focused on building a highly secure product with a simple user experience. Those two things are not easy to do together, and doing that well takes time. We took the time to do it right and build an experience we\u2019re proud of, and that offers our members the high level of security and usability that they expect and deserve,\u201D Neuman added.","Recent bank failures, the collapse of centralized crypto exchanges like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186132\/ftx-collapse-timeline-six-days-that-rocked-the-crypto-industry\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX<\/a> and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s actions against <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233146\/us-sec-sues-binance-ceo-zhao-for-breaking-securities-rules\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233270\/sec-sues-coinbase-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase<\/a>, have highlighted the importance of self-custody.&nbsp;","\u201CA lot of people learned the hard lesson of why holding your own keys is important,\u201D Neuman <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/190825\/ethereum-storage-coming-to-custodian-casa-as-centralized-exchanges-lose-their-luster\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told<\/a> The Block in an interview following FTX\u2019s demise.
