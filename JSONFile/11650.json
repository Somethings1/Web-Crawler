The last halving occurred in 2020, when the block reward was reduced from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25 bitcoin.","The next halving will occur after the mining of approximately 840,000 blocks, leading to a further reduction in the block reward, from the current 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This mechanism is programmed into the bitcoin protocol and is intended to control the supply of new bitcoins, making it more scarce over time.","The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization decreased by over 1% in the past 24 hours to $42,920 at 8:34 a.m. ET, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" data-v-03de5780=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block's Price Page<\/a>.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The price of bitcoin fell on Tuesday by over 1%.
