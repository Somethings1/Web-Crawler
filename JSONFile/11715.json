Now, as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/category\/the-merge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Merge<\/a> date looms close, the question of what will happen to all those machines and the miners operating them remains open.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Once the blockchain\u2019s consensus mechanism switches from proof of work to proof of stake (estimated to happen between Sept. 14 and 15), Ethereum miners won\u2019t need GPUs to verify blocks of transactions.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Unlike Bitcoin mining, which has become more industrial and consolidated, most of the Ethereum network is still made up of small-scale and individual miners. They will likely have the hardest time profiting from other proof-of-work coins like Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin or Ergo.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Based on the current economics, only about 100 terahash per second (TH\/s) of the Ethereum network will be able to \u201Cfind a home,\u201D in other blockchains, according to an estimate from Ethan Vera, COO of Luxor, which runs an Ethereum mining pool.

(...) You want a network where people actually want to come and build on it rather than only getting paid for it.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s possible but not certain that coins like ETC and Ravencoin could grow to a much larger size D\u2019Aria said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis has never really been tested before. Nothing like this is ever remotely happened,\u201D he said. \u201CSome people make the argument that miners are just extracting value from the system. They mine the coins they sell immediately and they're pushing the price down. I don't think that's the case. (...) I think miners have always been like a grassroots kind of support.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The value of ETC has gone up by roughly 37% since August 24, when the final dates of the Merge were announced, and as much as 140% since mid-July, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/oindesk.com\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to data from TradingView<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. \u201CI think that\u2019s no accident,\u201D D\u2019Aria said about ETC\u2019s rising price, which was around $40 at the time of publication.<\/span>","","","While EthereumPoW is another contender, he reckoned ETC will ultimately attract the most miners, especially given that the former was \u201Cill-prepared.\u201D Still, among the top coins, miners are looking at just over $1 million in revenue per day, compared to around $20 million from Ethereum.","An individual Ethereum miner who goes by daylon.eth on Twitter told The Block that he plans to mine ETC, RVN and possibly $FLUX or $ERGO, depending on how profitable each of them becomes. He currently pays about $0.08 per kilowatt hour and \u201Cprioritizes low energy consumption.\u201D","\u201CI started mining because I enjoy it as a hobby. Profitability is my main consideration, however, I actually never sold 99% of my mined $ETH for fiat,\u201D that user said. \u201CI mine for a hobby and not to support myself financially, so in the worse case scenario I will just sell my GPUs later. Preferably if\/when there is another bull market for mining hardware\u201D","Another user, by the handle j_crypto_2015 (who goes by J. W.), said the plan was to mine Ethereum Classic, but definitely not any other forked tokens \u2014 alluding to EthereumPoW, a proposed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163229\/ethpow-team-says-its-miner-led-ethereum-fork-is-inevitable\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fork on the Ethereum blockchain<\/a> after The Merge.&nbsp;","\u201CIf mining ETC is not profitable, the rigs will be paused and on hold.

The rest would just go away from the market,\u201D the company said. \u201CThe crypto mining market is self-regulated. If there is profit the mining continues. Nobody mines without a profit.\u201D","D\u2019Aria estimated that there are around $10 to $20 billion worth of GPUs on miners\u2019 hands, based on hash rate, while Vera points to roughly $7.9 billion. As far as the market for them goes, D\u2019Aria expects to see prices plunge 5% to 10% a week \"for quite a while,\" keeping in line with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/144954\/a-look-at-the-trends-driving-down-gpu-prices-and-what-this-means-for-ethereum-miners\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">trend from the past few months<\/a>.&nbsp;","\u201CPeople that were going to sell their GPU sold them already.
