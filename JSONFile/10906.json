To curb abuse of the platform, however, Morel said that Arkham must approve bounties and submissions for the program, and that users must show they obtained their information through public sources.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf there are people who have information about somebody who has conducted a hack or other info that\u2019s extremely valuable to the community, that is the kind of thing that will be accepted onto the Intel Exchange, and which will receive a lot of volume from the market,\" he said. \"<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It will not be small individual private wallets, because that\u2019s not the goal of the Arkham Intel Exchange.

Others worried the information could be incorrect and said that many could be forced to get private security if their holdings are revealed.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto trader Ran Neuer worried that those who have access to crypto wallet know-your-customer information, such as people working for centralized exchanges, may feel compelled to dox their user base for a reward.&nbsp;<\/span>","\"My issue is not with the [Arkham Intel Exchange] system,\" Neuer says. \"My issue is your company managing the data.\"","The comments came just one day after the company faced widespread criticism after it appeared to have made some customer emails<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238764\/arkham-referral-links-appear-to-reveal-user-email-addresses\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> publicly available<\/a> through decodable referral links that were shared by users in the runup to a token airdrop.&nbsp;","Identity, meanwhile, is key to Arkham's vision.
