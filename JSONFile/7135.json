As per the firm's website, it seeks to offer exposure \"to the investment team's highest-conviction ideas in the current market environment through an unconstrained approach,\" and \"the strategy opportunistically allocates to other asset classes to potentially enhance return and\/or mitigate risk.\"","\"To the extent the Fund invests in GBTC, it will do so through a wholly-owned subsidiary, which is organized as a limited company under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the \"Subsidiary\"). Except for its investment in GBTC, the Fund will not invest, directly or indirectly, in cryptocurrencies,\" the firm wrote in the filing.&nbsp;","<iframe title=\"BTC Holdings of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/grayscale\/bitcoin-holdings-of-grayscale-bitcoin-trust\/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"420\" frameborder=\"0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Grayscale, one of the largest crypto asset-managers, recently surpassed $10 billion in assets as bitcoin soared to highs rivaling levels in 2017. The firm's funds have gained popularity given their similarity to exchange-traded funds and their availability through retail brokers like Charles Schwab. Still, they have traded at large premiums, which have resulted in retail investors purchasing shares at a much higher premium than the price of the underlying crypto asset.&nbsp;","Guggenheim would be the latest to signal its interest in bitcoin as a macro play. Earlier this year, investment legend Paul Tudor Jones penned a note outlining how bitcoin could serve as an inflationary hedge against aggressive central bank policy. In October, the billionaire doubled down on his position, saying that he liked bitcoin \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/82023\/paul-tudor-jones-bitcoin-interview\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">more now than I did<\/a>.\"&nbsp;Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/84069\/stanley-druckenmiller-bitcoin-bet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> earlier this month that he had placed a bet on bitcoin.","Â© 2023 The Block.
