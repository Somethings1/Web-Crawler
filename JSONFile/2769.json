In February of this year a spokesman told the media that Dwyer was innocent, the charges were \"baseless,\" and he planned to mount a \"vigorous defense.\"","US regulators took the crypto derivatives exchange to task starting in October of 2020, when it charged the exchange and a number of its operators for skirting US regulations. Among those charged were co-founders Arthur Hayes, Ben Delo and Samuel Reed, in addition to Dwyer.","All the defendants pleaded not guilty at the start of their criminal trials, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/135406\/bitmex-co-founders-hayes-delo-plead-doj\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hayes, Delo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/137020\/bitmex-co-founder-samuel-reed-pleads-guilty-to-bank-secrecy-act-violation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reed<\/a> entered a change of plea during their proceedings. All avoided jail time.","Now, Dwyer has followed their lead. Like the co-founders, he faces up to five years for allegedly breaching the Bank Secrecy Act. However, his trial had faced a longer time horizon as his legal team argued the Australia-native had&nbsp;less time to prepare for the charges since he had been focused on navigating extradition proceedings from Bermuda. Ultimately he was extradited.","His trial was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/128686\/criminal-trial-for-bitmex-exec-greg-dwyer-delayed-to-october\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">slated<\/a> for October of this year.
