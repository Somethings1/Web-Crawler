Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s division of enforcement.","The SEC filed the complaint in federal district court in the District of Maryland, charging Lee and Chunga with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland also pressed criminal charges against Lee and Chunga.&nbsp;","Chunga has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. He also agreed to settle the charges and pay disgorgement and civil penalties in amounts that the court will determine.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
