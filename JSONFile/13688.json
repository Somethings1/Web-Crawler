Crypto is a global industry and is based on the concept of decentralization so we are exploring decentralizing our financial and human capital,\u201D he added. &nbsp;","The news comes during a period of drastic action by U.S. regulators in the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse late last year.","This year alone, the Securities and Exchange Commission has filed charges against multiple crypto outfits including Justin Sun and his companies, along with Bittrex and Gemini, and some celebrities for endorsing cryptocurrencies.
