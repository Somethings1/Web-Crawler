While his \"arguments against\" list highlighted his self-perceived flaws and the potential PR disaster their relationship could cause, his \"arguments in favor\" list was succinct, emphasizing his affection for her.","Bankman-Fried had found himself stretched thin between his responsibilities at Alameda and his public role at FTX, delegating day-to-day operations at Alameda to Sam Trabucco, a trader known to SBF since high school math camp, and Ellison. SBF imagined Trabucco managing trading risks with Ellison managing the staff. However, Trabucco's \u201Cshocking shift\u201D in work ethic after he was promoted to co-CEO left Ellison managing both personnel and trading risks, with only Bankman-Fried overseeing her.","That created some complications given Bankman-Fried and Ellison's relationship was more than professional, with Ellison wanting to expand the relationship and Bankman-Fried not, Lewis wrote.","\u201CThere\u2019s a pretty decent argument that my empathy is fake, my feelings are fake, my facial reactions are fake,\u201D Bankman-Fried continued in his arguments against the relationship. \u201CI\u2019m worried about power dynamics between us. This could destroy Alameda if it goes really poorly PR-wise.\u201D","On the flip side, Bankman-Fried expressed his affection for Ellison, feeling like he could talk openly with her and that she was \u201Ca good person, smart and impressive\" with \u201Cgood judgment.\u201D","Ellison's desire for a more traditional relationship was evident in her memos to Bankman-Fried. However, she wasn't happy with the couple's communication on their feelings and lack of social affirmation of their relationship, believing Bankman-Fried\u2019s arguments were masking his true motives. \u201CI guess a lot of what bothers me is feeling like you\u2019re ashamed of me,\u201D she later wrote.","\u201CIf I felt you also felt positive about people knowing we were dating but just thought it was a bad idea to share, I think I wouldn\u2019t mind as much,\u201D Ellison explained. \"Again, I feel like if I were better\/more impressive, you wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed for people to know we were dating.\u201D&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
