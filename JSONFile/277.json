So in many ways, the SEC already has engaged and issuers simply have less to engage on this time.\"","While the SEC hasn't necessarily engaged with the spot ether ETF applications, the agency reportedly is in a supposed campaign to label ether as a security.","The regulator has reportedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284284\/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-may-extremely-unlikely-galaxy-thorn\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued subpoenas<\/a> to crypto firms regarding their relationship with the Ethereum Foundation.","These recent actions from the SEC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284284\/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-may-extremely-unlikely-galaxy-thorn\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">indicate to<\/a> Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, that approval for spot ether exchange-traded funds in May seems \"extremely unlikely.\""],"hashtag":["SEC","SPOT ETHEREUM ETF"]}
