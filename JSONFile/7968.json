But, David Mercer, CEO of LMAX Group, said what the ban really does is effectively halve the leverage. The FCA had already limited leverage to retail customers to two-to-one, now it's one-to-one.","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b>\"You've banned derivatives, but actually you've just halved leverage. It's one-to-one rather than two-to-one. That's all that's really happened,\" said Mercer. \"What they're saying to everyone, you can own crypto assets, you just can't own it on leverage.\"","Still, Mercer said there is a duty in capital markets to protect retail investors and firms have a duty of care. LMAX Digital, owned by LMAX Group, is a regulated broker in the U.K., trading mostly spot, but clients still pass suitability tests indicating their understanding of the product. Working with regulators, even when you disagree with them \u2014 and Mercer said he does disagree with the ban \u2014 is key.","Mercer laid out why he thinks the FCA took such an aggressive approach on this issue as well as its implications on this episode of The Scoop.
