The 47.5% cut from each transaction will include a hardware platform fee of 30% for sales through the Meta Quest Store. Horizon Worlds will charge another 17.5% fee on top of that. &nbsp;","\u201CThe future of work is giving Meta 47.5% of your salary, apparently,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/punk6529\/status\/1514018050462429187\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted punk 6529<\/a>, an NFT art collector and commentator.","The feature will initially only be available to a handful of creators to sell merchandise and experiences. \u201CFor example, someone could make and sell attachable accessories for a fashion world or offer paid access to a new part of a world,\u201D said a <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2022\/04\/testing-creator-monetization-horizon-worlds\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/a> from the company.","Others commented that the high fee won\u2019t deter people from trying it out but might prompt other companies to follow the lead. Currently, other NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and LooksRare, take a small percentage of each transaction, at just 2.5% and 2%, respectively.","The news comes months after Zuckerberg had highlighted how the company would focus on making the metaverse more accessible to creators by criticizing the 30% fee that Apple charges developers on transactions.&nbsp;","\u201CImagine selling a nft and meta taking a 47.5% fee THEN to rub salt in the wound having to pay tax on top of the profits,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shrimpyuk\/status\/1514171664942182404\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> one NFT creator, highlighting that creators will be left with little after the sales.&nbsp;","\u201CWe think it\u2019s a pretty competitive rate in the market,\u201D Vivek Sharma, Meta\u2019s VP of Horizon, told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2022\/4\/11\/23020684\/meta-horizon-worlds-test-creators-sell-virtual-items-monetization\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Verge<\/a>. \u201CWe believe in the other platforms being able to have their share.\u201D&nbsp;","According to a February <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HorizonWorlds\/status\/1494007916990373895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1494007916990373895%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F2%2F17%2F22939297%2Fmeta-social-vr-platform-horizon-300000-users\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweet<\/a> from the company, the platform had 10,000 worlds in the process of being created.
