Deaton stated that \"an appeal is not even close to a setback.\"","Elaborating, the Crypto Law founder <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JohnEDeaton1\/status\/1682863291947974659\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">explained<\/a> his belief that&nbsp;\"it will be two years from now before a decision is issued by the 2nd Circuit, if it\u2019s appealed,\" adding: \"The Torres Decision is the law until then \u2014 at least in the 2nd Circuit.\"","If or when an appeal comes in the Ripple case, it would go to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.","Deaton's take comes after SEC lawyers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241027\/sec-lawyers-preview-likely-ripple-appeal-in-case-against-do-kwon\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">used a separate ongoing enforcement case<\/a> \u2014 against Terraform Labs and its former CEO, Do Kwon \u2014 to preview its expected appeal of last week's split decision in the agency's case against Ripple Labs.","\u201CRespectfully, those portions of Ripple were wrongly decided, and this Court should not follow them,\u201D SEC lawyers argued in a Friday filing to Judge Jed Rakoff of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.","The portion of the Ripple decision likely to be appealed is that which determined&nbsp;that \u201Cblind bid\u201D or \u201Cprogrammatic\u201D sales of XRP to third parties did not fit all the criteria of a securities offering.","To this point, Deaton tweeted that \"even if the 2nd Circuit said Torres was wrong regarding her application of the 3rd Howey factor [...] that doesn\u2019t mean the SEC wins on Programmatic sales (sales on exchanges).\"","\"All that happens is that Torres then applies the other two factors and could likely still rule the same exact way, concluding the SEC didn\u2019t satisfy the common enterprise factor,\" he said, before opining:&nbsp;\"Don\u2019t let anyone underestimate how significant this win is for XRP, XRP holders and Ripple.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
