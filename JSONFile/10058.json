In its original form, the blue tick, first put into play in 2009, was a marker to signal a true identity \u2013 a seal of authenticity that someone was indeed who they claimed to be. Late last year, Musk lowered the bar, allowing people to buy verification for $8. Accounts which were verified through the old system now bear a warning to the viewer: \u201CThis account may or may not be notable.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By riffing on this theme, Checks VV, an NFT art project created by visual artist Jack Butcher and his design shop Visualize Value, has captured crypto Twitter and the digital art world\u2019s imaginations.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe acquisition of Twitter was a catalyst for this; a moment in time where people were asking what it means to be verified,\u201D Butcher said in an interview with The Block. Butcher originally used the check mark in his work to differentiate a JPEG from an NFT.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">First sold for $8 in an open mint, the 8x10 grids featuring multicolored check marks have since seen a parabolic price spike, more than $124 million in<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/checks.art\/stats\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> secondary sales<\/span><\/a>, <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">and a host of copycat collections. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With an inbuilt burning mechanism, the potential for a diminishing supply has led to some saying it could be one of the most valuable NFT collections of all time. <\/span>But while the price has spiked, others feel Checks may be susceptible to the same hype cycles that have plagued the biggest collections on the scene, especially in a prolonged bear market.&nbsp;","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"When things move that fast I get cautious \u2013 it's the type of movement we\u2019ve been conditioned to fade,\" said Sasha Fleyshman, portfolio manager at crypto fund Arca.&nbsp;<\/span>","While Fleyshman believes Butler's project is evidence of the crypto space coalescing around an idea, there is a caveat emptor for people looking to capitalize on it. <span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The thing to watch here is how he executes his plan,\" he added.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Butcher, like many others in the digital art market, came to the world of NFTs as a marketing professional. After growing up and going to university in the UK, the artist got his first job at a small design agency in New York through sending a barrage of applications via Craigslist ads.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After years of working for other people, he founded his own company and became embedded into the NFT scene, which felt like a natural transition from corporate marketing to digital art. Through this work, he said, he wanted to ask why it is important to enable ownership in an economy which is increasingly digital; and why digital authorship is important. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This also played out on Twitter, as the popularity of the collection, and his own profile, grew.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/span>","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Through treating verification as a cultural symbol via a mark that has no copyright of its own, Checks has also inspired a host of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/checks.art\/feed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">derivative works<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.
