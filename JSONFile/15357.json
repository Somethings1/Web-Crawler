The platform was also slapped with a $70 million fine by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for failing to protect customers.","\"Robinhood repeatedly failed to serve its clients, but this settlement makes clear that Robinhood must take its customer care obligations seriously and correct these deficiencies,\u201D NASAA President Andrew Hartnett said in a press statement.","Read more: Robinhood Received Crypto-Related Subpoena Request From SEC: 10K"],"entity":[{"type":"Delaware","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Robinhood Markets","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"California Department of Financial Protection","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New Jersey","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"South Dakota","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$70 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NASAA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Robinhood Received Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Andrew Hartnett","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York State Department of Financial Services","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"DFPI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$65 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Robinhood","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Colorado","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Texas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$30 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"March 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$10.2 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"California","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Alabama","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Robinhood","Settlement","California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation"],"authors":["Sandali Handagama"]}
