Ledger\u2019s CEO Pascal Gauthier, a flash Frenchman with more rings than fingers, got a stark reminder of that earlier this year. &nbsp;","The Paris-based hardware wallet maker <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230992\/ledger-defends-crypto-wallet-recovery-tool\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">drew a sharp backlash<\/a> in May over a service it hopes will help users recover their private keys by splitting seed phrases into three shards shared between Ledger and two other security companies, CoinCover and EscrowTech.","But for Ledger\u2019s customers, many of whom fancy themselves self-sovereign, the product set off alarm bells. A significant concern was whether private keys could be reassembled and served up in the event of a government subpoena.","In damage control mode, Ledger delayed the initial launch date. Its CTO Charles Guillemet <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231350\/ledger-cto-on-recover-softwares-access-to-private-keys-the-tradeoff-i-think-is-acceptable\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said at the time that the perceived security trade-off of the product was acceptable,<\/a>&nbsp;while Gauthier&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231794\/ledger-ceo-concedes-subpoena-to-access-user-funds-is-the-only-concern\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> that government subpoenas are not a prospect that should trouble the average user. The company also stressed that the recovery service would be entirely optional, adding that it would accelerate plans to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231857\/ledger-plans-to-accelerate-open-source-work-in-wake-of-recover-backlash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">open source its product roadmap, as well as the Ledger Recover protocol<\/a>.","Were the cypherpunks satisfied?","\u201CI\u2019ve been booed at Bitcoin Miami,\u201D Gauthier said in an interview with The Block last week. \u201CIt was the day after the Ledger Recover thing, and I was sure that he was booing me for this.\u201D In fact, the audience member in question \u2014 a long-time Ledger customer \u2014 was angry about Ledger not offering a Bitcoin-only wallet. This entirely separate issue, Gauthier said, has irked some users since 2017.","\u201CIn six years, you will have the guy who\u2019s going to boo me in a conference because of Ledger Recover. It\u2019s ok. It\u2019s part of our life when we do crypto,\u201D he added. \u201CTo be honest, I\u2019ve got thick skin.\u201D","Despite the drama, Gauthier said he still expects Ledger Recover to go live before the end of the year \u2014&nbsp;with some of the open-source features disgruntled users called for. The code behind the product can already be reviewed <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/LedgerHQ\/recover-whitepaper\/tree\/main\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on Ledger\u2019s GitHub page<\/a>.","The popularity of self-custody \u2014 which refers to people storing their own crypto rather than delegating storage to a third party, such as an exchange \u2014 has grown considerably after the sector\u2019s annus horribilis in 2022, which saw multiple marquee startups in the space collapse into bankruptcy, tying up the funds of millions of users. Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s failed exchange, FTX, alone, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-01-11\/ftx-advisers-have-found-5-billion-of-cash-or-sellable-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">had more than nine million customer accounts<\/a>.","In March, analytics provider Santiment said that the percentage of ether held on crypto exchanges <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/santimentfeed\/status\/1640454653900124166?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">had effectively hit an all-time low of 10.31%<\/a>, suggesting a surge in self-custody.","Yet, despite its appeal, self-custody is a tricky business. Stories abound of <a href=\"https:\/\/decrypt.co\/154522\/youtuber-loses-60k-worth-crypto-after-showing-seed-phrase-stream\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto holders losing or mismanaging their seed phrases<\/a>, often with disastrous consequences. For Gauthier, the model is simply too much trouble for the vast majority of users.","\u201CThe 24 words is the big pain of self-custody. Self-custody will never scale if the next 100 million users that go into self-custody have to save their 24 words somewhere,\u201D he said. \u201CSo we need to have mechanisms à la Ledger Recover to do it. Otherwise, it just doesn\u2019t scale.\u201D","The challenge for Ledger is that, while on the one hand, its hardware is relied on by what Gauthier calls \u201Csuper-geeks,\u201D it is simultaneously a fast-growing consumer business that had <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sold more than 6 million devices as of March this year<\/a>. Venture capitalists have poured over half a billion dollars into the startup since it launched in 2014, including a $108 million top-up in March \u2014 cash that comes with certain growth expectations.","\u201CMost people say, \u2018Well, I would never trust myself with those 24 words.\u2019 It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201D Gauthier said. \u201CIf you give them a solution that is acceptable to 99.9% of populations living in countries like Europe, U.S., etc., then we think it\u2019s a great product and it\u2019s very needed in the market.\u201D","He continued: \u201CI\u2019ll use it personally. So, if anyone has a doubt, I will be the first user of that product because I think it\u2019s a better way to store my 24 words.\u201D","Ledger Recover isn\u2019t the only thorny privacy issue with which Gauthier must contend.","At a time when privacy coins \u2014&nbsp;which grant crypto users more anonymity than, say, bitcoin \u2014&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/binance-to-delist-privacy-tokens-in-france-italy-spain-and-poland\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">are being removed from major exchanges in Europe<\/a>, Ledger remains committed to supporting them.","CoinDesk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/187078\/european-aml-rules-could-ban-privacy-coins-coindesk\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported last year<\/a> that the European Union was considering a ban preventing banks and licensed crypto firms from dealing in privacy coins. When Binance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/249473\/binance-privacy-coins-belgium\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">halted the trading of privacy coins in Belgium a few weeks ago<\/a>, it said in a statement that it is \u201Crequired to follow local laws and regulations regarding the trading of privacy coins.\u201D","Yet, Ledger users can store Monero, a popular privacy coin with a market capitalization of $2.7 billion, on their devices. Gauthier said Ledger lobbied hard to ensure that the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) rules, which came into effect this year, wouldn\u2019t capture self-custody \u2014 and succeeded. \u201CSelf-custody is outside of regulation, and self-custody is a fundamental human right,\u201D he said. &nbsp;","Privacy coins are controversial. Some see them as freedom-preserving, others as an ideal tool for obscuring illicit transactions. \u201CYou can feel that there is a lot of pressure on privacy,\u201D Gauthier said. \u201COur business is to secure our users and give them the ability to be free and do whatever they want, and so there are certain situations where a user will want to remain absolutely private.\u201D","As with the recovery service, optionality is at the heart of Ledger\u2019s privacy plans. The firm is wrestling with how to support both entirely private transactions and the means to provide identifying information where needed \u2014&nbsp;Gauthier gave the example of using a bitcoin or ether-based product offered by a bank \u2014 without one compromising the other. The crux of the issue, as Gauthier put it, is that \u201Cif you have an ETH address, I know everything you own.\u201D","Identity and privacy are, therefore, two standout themes on Ledger\u2019s roadmap for 2024 and 2025. One initiative that\u2019s already live is named \u201CFreedom Tools,\u201D which gives users a way to run Ledger and Ledger Live, its crypto wallet app, with total privacy.","\u201CWe\u2019re going to try and build as much as privacy as possible when you want it, if you want it, as well as security,\u201D Gauthier said. \u201CWe feel it\u2019s important because we don\u2019t all live in democracies. Sometimes, you have a need for absolute privacy for very valid reasons.\u201D","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
