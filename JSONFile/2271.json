FriendTech popularized the idea of having gated communities where users need to pay for so-called keys to access group chats, with the price of the keys getting more expensive each time one is bought.","Running on the Linea platform, Tomo offers a few different things compared to FriendTech, such as the ability to message someone directly. But the main aspect that makes Tomo different is that it lets users bet on the value of people's keys, if they were they to join the platform. Tesla CEO Elon Musk's keys, for instance, are currently valued at 0.478 ETH ($743), and that's the price they would start trading at if he were to join the platform.&nbsp;","Based on Bitcoin Layer 2 network NOS, New Bitcoin City is taking a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/256392\/social-finance-platforms-experiment-with-new-features-in-bid-to-dethrone-friendtech-or-even-x\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">slightly different approach<\/a> from most social finance platforms by trying to be more of a social layer, allowing users from other protocols like FriendTech to use their keys on its app.","New Bitcoin City has added a few levels of customization, including the ability to set<span data-v-79c326f0=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> the fee that a group chat owner charges for the purchase of their keys (between 0-8%) and the number of keys needed to access their group chat.
