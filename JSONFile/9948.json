In the initial ruling, the court found that McCormack's comments were defamatory but based on Wright's conduct in the trial, reduced the damages to just £1.","The UK Court of Appeal upheld the previous ruling, stating that Wright failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claims, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.judiciary.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Wright-v-McCormack-judgment-260723.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">court filing<\/a> today.&nbsp;","\u201CThe judges agreed with the decision of Justice Chamberlain to reduce his damages to £1 for putting forward \u201Cdeliberately false\u201D evidence of serious harm,\u201D McCormack <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PeterMcCormack\/status\/1684138448557416448\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>.","This ruling could have further implications for Wright, who has been involved in several legal battles over his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, including against Magnus Granath, known as hodlonaut.","The news follows an <a href=\"https:\/\/caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/ewhc\/ch\/2023\/1893\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">order<\/a> by UK judge James Mellor on Tuesday for Wright to deposit $516,000 as security for legal costs to continue his case against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. The judge said he wasn\u2019t convinced about Wright's ability to cover legal costs citing previous inconsistent statements about his financial position, and warned that the case would be dismissed within weeks if the security isn't provided.","© 2023 The Block.
