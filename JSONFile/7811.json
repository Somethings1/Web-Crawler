But that could all quickly change if developers can figure out how to unlock token potential, reduce friction and go multiplatform, according to the firm\u2019s co-founder and partner Michael Anderson.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Asked to outline what the blockchain gaming space needs to do in order to turn the corner, Anderson echoed a similar refrain: make games that are \u201Cactually fun to play.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMost of the crypto games that are live today are not games that people would put hours into without a financial incentive,\u201D Anderson told The Block. \"That's a major problem if the space wants to onboard new users.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although fun trumps the pull of making a buck when it comes to convincing gamers to play blockchain-powered games, that doesn\u2019t mean the crypto component can\u2019t prove valuable. Anderson suggested that with some exciting titles set to go live in the coming months, the games that stand out will likely \u201Ctake a page from DeFi\u201D and \u201Crely on token models that accrue value generated by their ecosystems.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If gamers do attain digital assets which have value, they\u2019ll want to store them in a safe place, and that should be made easier, said Anderson, adding that he\u2019s witnessed some experimentation that suggests gaming developers are closer to streamlining the process of gamer signup. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt's imperative for the gaming space to overcome the \u2026 difficulty in converting normal users into web3 users without overburdening them with a cumbersome wallet setup,\u201D he said. \u201CWe\u2019re already seeing some games play around with pre-funded wallets or temporarily paying or subsidizing gas on behalf of the users and we\u2019re confident that a solution will be found eventually.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While Anderson stopped short of mentioning any specific titles he feels have performed well thus far, he pointed to efforts by gaming companies to create multi-platform universes.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COne of the dominant trends that we\u2019re seeing is the concept of studios creating ecosystems and universes in which live multiple different games that differ in platform, gameplay, and even difficulty,\u201D he said. \u201CWith this model, web3 game studios can make inroads across mobile and mainstream gaming audiences.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The push to distribute web3 games on iOS and Android mobile devices has gained steam recently as Apple and Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239286\/google-play-allows-users-to-earn-crypto-assets-in-apps-and-games\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">soften<\/a> their restrictions as they relate to blockchain-powered games. Those have been \u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">powerful signals for the future of mobile<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in this space,\u201D according to Anderson.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Framework <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/142512\/framework-ventures-unveils-400-million-fund-with-a-special-focus-on-blockchain-gaming\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> in April of last year it had raised $400 million for its third crypto fund, bringing the firm\u2019s total assets under management to $1.4 billion.
