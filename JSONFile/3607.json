Among all these issues, the project faced accusations that it was a scam and that the team intended to run away with the funds, it <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArcoProtocol\/status\/1586452711314116608\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> on Twitter.","As a result, it has put out a Twitter poll asking for support in order to continue. It gave three options: back the project and keep it running; hand over control of the project to the community; or shut the whole thing down and issue a refund.","While the poll still has hours left, nearly half of the 9,000 votes \u2014 48% \u2014 are in favor of a refund. This is followed by a third of votes backing the community and a remaining 20% that want it to be decentralized. While this does mean 52% of voters are in favor of the project continuing in some form, it will likely have to go with the most popular vote and shut down.","Arco claimed that \"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ArcoFamily<\/span>\" was the largest community on Aptos and that it was \"unstoppable.\" Alas, if the vote continues on its current trajectory, that will no longer be the case.","Â© 2023 The Block.
