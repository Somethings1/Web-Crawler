Of those 30 enforcement actions, 70% alleged fraud, 73% alleged an unregistered securities offering and 50% alleged both. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Some of the biggest cases brought last year include the charges against a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/158960\/former-coinbase-product-manager-arrested-on-insider-trading-charges\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">former Coinbase employee<\/a>, his brother and his friend for allegedly running an insider trading scheme and another case <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194509\/sam-bankman-fried-charged-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in December<\/a> against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried for allegedly defrauding investors. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that the vast majority of cryptocurrencies are securities. Lawmakers last year introduced legislation to regulate crypto, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177371\/pieces-of-crypto-bill-could-pass-in-six-months-authors-lummis-and-gillibrand-say\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">some bills<\/a> giving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission jurisdiction over the largest digital assets. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C<\/span><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It seems crypto assets will likely continue to be a priority under the Gensler administration,\u201D said <\/span><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Simona Mola, principal at Cornerstone Research and author of the report. Mola cited the 50% uptick in enforcement actions and the agency\u2019s expansion of its Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mola also said an increase in assistance that the agency received from outside agencies and organizations during its crypto-related investigations was a surprising finding. Of the 127 enforcement actions from 2013 to 2022, the SEC received assistance from outside agencies and organizations in 56 actions, according to the report. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CUnder the Gensler administration, the SEC has been increasingly assisted by multiple international authorities in its cryptocurrency enforcement actions, which is likely&nbsp;a byproduct&nbsp;of the number of U.S. agencies regulating the space in addition to the SEC, but also a byproduct of the increasing complexity of certain cases that often transcend the national borders,\u201D Mola said. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The consulting firm has a database with crypto related enforcement actions brought by the SEC between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2022. Mola also used the SEC\u2019s enforcement website, among other methodologies. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer: Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
