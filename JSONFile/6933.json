That\u2019s the second payout this year.","That fund <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/170350\/spice-vc-to-make-investor-payout-after-selling-blockdaemon-securitize-stakes\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">already has paid back<\/a> 82% of its investors\u2019 initial investment, a rarity in the space, according to founder and managing partner <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/talelyashiv\/?originalSubdomain=il\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tal Elyashiv<\/a>. The average time for a startup to reach an exit can be more than eight years, according to a Venturebeat <a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/entrepreneur\/vc-investing-still-strong-even-as-median-time-to-exit-reaches-8-2-years\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report<\/a>.","\u201CThis is unheard of in early stage funds in general,\u201D Elyashiv said in an interview today. \u201CThe multiple on funds invested is close to six. That\u2019s the value of the fund versus money invested in the fund, so this is obviously extremely helpful in raising SPiCE II.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe strategy of the second fund, launched in May, is similar to its predecessor \u2013 focusing on companies building key components of the blockchain ecosystem. But because the industry has progressed, the verticals have expanded from being largely financial to everything from gaming and insurance to supply chain management and healthcare.","Exact investments haven\u2019t yet been pinpointed as \u201Cthe good companies raise much faster than in the past,\u201D said Elyashiv, who previously was Capital One's CIO. \u201CWhere in the past VCs would take several months to make a decision on investments, now opportunities are not open for that long.\u201D","That said, VCs are being more wary with their money.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CWhere herd mentality played a bigger role a year ago, VCs are more cautious now, doing much deeper due diligence and want to be more sure about what they\u2019re investing in,\u201D Elyashiv said. That\u2019s because some companies this year ended up \u201Ctoo short in terms of runway and got hurt really badly in being able to raise next rounds. VCs are much more leery of that right now.\u201D","A third fund will only come into shape once the firm has the capacity to focus on one.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect the fund will have its first close by the end of this year.<\/em><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n","Â© 2023 The Block.
