In contrast, every single buyer within the top 20 sales for Otherdeeds have wallets created months or years prior to the sale occurring, indicating that the buyers and sales were not bots or wash trades like those found on MG Land.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wash trading is when assets are traded between wallets owned by the same individual or company. It can create not only artificial volume but also manipulate the price.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Those top 19 sales all closed between roughly $27,500 and $28,500 per NFT.
