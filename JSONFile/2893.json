Now that TCN is live, JPMorgan has a pipeline of other clients and transactions, Ed Bond, head of trading services at JPMorgan, told Bloomberg.","TCN helps move collateral almost instantly, much quicker than the usual day-long process, according to Lobban. If implemented on a larger scale, the application could boost efficiency by making locked-up capital available for use as collateral in ongoing transactions, Lobban said.","While TCN is initially focused on money market funds, it reportedly will look to add support for other assets as collateral, including equities and fixed income.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/241500\/tokenization-of-off-chain-assets-presented-by-avalanche-and-ava-labs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Asset tokenization<\/a> is believed to lead to quicker transactions. It's like skipping the step of converting your paper money into coins when you want to use a vending machine \u2014 you can use tokens directly and get your snack faster.","JPMorgan also runs a blockchain-based payment system called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236134\/jpmorgan-jpm-coin-euro\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JPM Coin<\/a>. JPM Coin operates beyond standard banking hours and is faster, thus helping clients initiate payments just before they are due.
