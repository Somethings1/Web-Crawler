He said the SEC should remove the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/speech-hinman-061418\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">speech<\/a> from its website and said it should no longer be invoked in discussion about whether or not a security is a token.&nbsp;","\"Unelected bureaucrats must faithfully apply the law within the constraints of their jurisdiction. They can\u2019t - as Hinman tried - create new law,\" Alderoty continued.&nbsp;","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse echoed the view.","\"It\u2019s absolutely unconscionable that a regulator \u2013 when presented with so much pushback on what he was about to say \/ how he compiled this fake 'test' in the first place \u2013 decided to move forward anyway, and throw an entire industry into chaos,\" he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bgarlinghouse\/status\/1668601650242809857?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a> on Twitter.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
