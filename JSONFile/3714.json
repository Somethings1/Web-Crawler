Immunefi <a href=\"https:\/\/immunefi.com\/bounty\/immunefi\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">provides rewards in USDC<\/a>, according to its website.","Projects and whitehats can connect their web3 wallets to securely manage the bounty payout, including platform fees, entirely on-chain via the Immunefi Dashboard. Users can check if the funds allocated to bounties are sufficient before submitting bug reports, Immunefi said.","Immunefi\u2019s vaults system is already used by ether staking infrastructure project SSV Network and Near-based decentralized exchange Ref Finance, according to the statement. SSV Network has deposited $1 million into its sovereign vault.","\u201CThe Vaults System will help us provide added reassurance for any researcher engaging with our bounty program, and in turn help secure the protocol even further. A good win-win.\u201D SSV DAO contributor Eridian said. \u201CBuilding further trust with the community by showcasing dedicated funding, and streamlining the payment process, will ultimately strengthen our security efforts.\u201D","Immunefi says it has <a href=\"https:\/\/immunefi.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">paid out more than $80 million in bounties<\/a> and saved over $25 billion in user funds across protocols like Chainlink, The Graph, Synthetix and MakerDAO.","Last month, Immunefi said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/248550\/web3-losses-exceed-1-billion-in-2023-base-exploits\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">web3 platforms lost over $1.2 billion<\/a> in 2023 as Base projects added to crypto exploits in August.","Â© 2023 The Block.
