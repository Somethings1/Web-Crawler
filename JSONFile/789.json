The agency lost approximately 289 positions in fiscal year 2022, which could pose a challenge in filling its roles for next year, according to the inspector general.","The commission could address its attrition issues by planning for succession, through employee development and via performance management, the report suggested. The SEC could also streamline its hiring process \u2014 nearly 50% of the commission\u2019s hiring actions took 100 business days or more to complete."],"hashtag":["GARY GENSLER"]}
