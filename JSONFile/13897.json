It may have been similar to the Anyswap exploit, which saw $7.9 million stolen due to a hacker reversing the private key.","The hack has also had wider implications. As a result of it, O3, a trading pool that uses Poly Network to trade tokens among different blockchains, has had to suspend its cross-chain functionality.","The assets stolen were $273 million of <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xc8a65fadf0e0ddaf421f28feab69bf6e2e589963\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum tokens<\/a>, $253 million in <a href=\"https:\/\/bscscan.com\/address\/0x0d6e286a7cfd25e0c01fee9756765d8033b32c71\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tokens on Binance Smart Chain<\/a> and $85 million <a href=\"https:\/\/polygonscan.com\/address\/0x5dc3603C9D42Ff184153a8a9094a73d461663214\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in USDC<\/a> on the Polygon network.","Since the theft, Tether has <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/paoloardoino\/status\/1425090760609832978?s=21\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blacklisted<\/a> the USDT on Ethereum that was stolen in the attack, roughly $33 million in tokens. That means they can no longer be moved.
