Both bitcoin and ether haven't moved much in price on the day and have had low trading volumes over the past few weeks. \u201CThe prevailing outlook suggests that in the absence of an ETF-triggered catalyst or substantial cryptocurrency-related drama, these price levels could persist for an extended period,\u201D Matteo Bottacini, at Crypto Finance AG, wrote in a morning note.","PayPal USD (PYUSD) is the latest stablecoin to come to market. Stablecoins are digital tokens tied to a stable asset, typically the U.S. dollar. PayPal's Ethereum-based token will soon be available to PayPal users in the U.S. This is the first time a major financial company is issuing its own stablecoin. Users can transfer PYUSD between PayPal and supported external digital wallets, use the tokens to pay for goods and services or convert any of PayPal's supported cryptocurrencies to and from PYUSD.","Crypto exchange Bitstamp is raising capital to expand the number of markets it serves around the world, according to a report from Bloomberg. \u201CBitstamp is not for sale, and we are not actively looking to sell the company,\u201D CEO Jean-Baptiste Graftieaux said in a statement to Bloomberg. \u201COur current and exclusive priority is to raise money through strategic investors to accelerate Bitstamp\u2019s growth by providing new products and services to retail and institutional crypto customers.\" Bitstamp will use the funds to launch a licensed derivatives trading operation in Europe and expand into more markets in Asia.","- Omkar Godbole","Edited by Mark Nacinovich."],"entity":[{"type":"First Mover","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Baptiste Graftieaux","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Matteo Bottacini","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"PayPal USD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Omkar Godbole","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"PayPal","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jean","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Finance AG","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Europe","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Mark Nacinovich","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["First Mover","Markets","PayPal","Stablecoin","Bitstamp"],"authors":["Lyllah Ledesma","Omkar Godbole"]}
