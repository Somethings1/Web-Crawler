At 02:09 UTC, the issue was deemed to be resolved.","The network went down in the early hours of Feb. 25, meaning transactions weren't processing on the network as they're supposed to. A few hours later, a first network restart took place but it was ineffective, leading to the second solution.","The blockchain has dealt with downtime multiple times in the past.
