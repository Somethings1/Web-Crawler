It reached above $73,000 earlier this month.","For the end of 2025, Standard Chartered Bank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270976\/spot-bitcoin-etf-inflows-standard-chartered-bank\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">continues<\/a> to maintain its bitcoin price target of $200,000.","The analysts said this target is \"correct\" based on the gold analogy. Specifically, the target is based on gold price moves after U.S. gold ETFs were introduced and the gold vs. bitcoin optimization, which suggests 80% gold and 20% bitcoin in the portfolio, the analysts said. \"Assuming the gold price stays unchanged, the BTC price would need to increase to $190,000 in order for BTC's share to rise to the 20% indicated by our portfolio optimization,\" the analysts noted.","However, if spot <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/270976\/spot-bitcoin-etf-inflows-standard-chartered-bank\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin ETF inflows<\/a> hit the bank's mid-point estimate of $75 billion and\/or if forex reserve managers start buying bitcoin, the bank sees a strong possibility of exceeding this target \u2014 with the price potentially reaching $250,000 at some point in 2025.","\"FX reserves are another large sticky (potential) cash pool, which could follow in the footsteps of new U.S. pension money,\" the analysts said. \"If they do, we would expect the largest and most liquid assets \u2014 such as bitcoin \u2014 to receive most of the inflows. We see a rising likelihood that large reserve managers may announce BTC buying in 2024,\" they added.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
