Here\u2019s Why They Shouldn\u2019t.","category":["Markets"],"content":["Deciding to invest in the fast-paced, ever-evolving digital assets market can seem daunting. In the past, people were often hesitant to invest in digital assets \u2013 namely cryptocurrency \u2013 because of their inherent volatility and associated risk. But the tides are changing, particularly as the global cryptocurrency market has grown into a flourishing, multi-sector ecosystem since bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) 2009 debut.","Below, I break down \u2013 and debunk \u2013 some common misconceptions about the potential risks that investors assume while gaining exposure to the digital assets ecosystem.","The term \u201Cvolatility\u201D often comes with a negative connotation, but that\u2019s not always the case. Investors can experience swings up or down; it\u2019s important to remember that there is upside potential, too.","For example, bitcoin has been called the best-performing asset of the decade, yet its price heavily depends on a number of factors, including supply and demand, investor sentiment and the media hype cycle. Even the most-prominent and well-capitalized cryptocurrency experiences fluctuations, resulting in positive returns and, at times, losses.","When an investment portfolio is constructed in a professional manner, volatility has the potential to be a portfolio enhancement rather than a disadvantage. That\u2019s because advisers have the expertise to help by setting frequent rebalances and buying and selling orders at certain thresholds. We\u2019ve seen this play out time and time again as the adoption curve for digital assets has ramped up over the years.","Investors should aim for a balanced portfolio, meaning one that isn\u2019t dominated by a certain asset class (whether digital assets or otherwise). Diversification is key. Adding alternatives to a portfolio can not only help avoid concentration risk but also hedge against inflationary environments.","Around a 2% allocation to digital assets is often standard in an investment portfolio. To some, that may seem like an insignificant percentage. But in practice, that often means the downside risk is minimized and the potential upside is tremendous; even a 2% bitcoin allocation in a standard portfolio over the last five years would have driven a significant share of the portfolio\u2019s growth.","An allocation that small \u2013 regardless of how powerful it can be \u2013 shouldn\u2019t take up the vast majority of an investor\u2019s time or energy. Instead, financial advisers can help ensure portfolio construction is purposeful, rather than ad hoc. Advisers take on the management burden by keeping track of market conditions and recommending a rebalance schedule that works for the individual investor and their specific financial goals.","Some risk-averse investors likely have exposure to the digital assets industry without realizing it. That includes established, highly trusted brands that are historically slower to embrace disruptive technologies. For instance, global payments giant Visa recently announced an expansion of its stablecoin settlement capabilities, becoming one of the first major payment institutions to do so.","Although the industry is still in its infancy, the possible use cases are vast. And the investment opportunity is exciting \u2013 despite (and, in some instances, because of) volatility and risk.","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"2%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2009","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","Crypto Long & Short","risks","Volatility","Portfolio management","Institutional Investment","inflation hedge"],"authors":["Erik Anderson"]}
