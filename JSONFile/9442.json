Musical artists didn\u2019t know that their work was being sold on HitPiece. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This caused a huge outcry of artists and music fans alike. While the music NFT platform appears to have started out with the intention to help artists perpetually earn revenue from their sales, it has now been denigrated so hard that it pulled its marketplace off its site. This begs the question: how did we get here?&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">HitPiece was originally launched in 2020 by Rory Felton, a music producer who co-founded the indie record label The Militia Group which was later acquired by Sony Music, along with Jeff Birmingham, an early investor in Spotify. In January, Felton announced that the startup raised $5 million in seed funding on the podcast <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Business Builders<\/i>.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The two intended for HitPiece to be \u201Cthe place for music NFTs online,\u201D Felton said on the podcast<\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. <\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the beta version of HitPiece, users could collect 1\/1 edition NFTs for every song in the world that was built on top of Spotify\u2019s API.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe idea is that you show off to your friends or people around the world that you own the greatest HitList you can create of all your favorite songs,\u201D Felton explained on the podcast. \u201CThe artist gets royalties from not only the initial auction but also every time it\u2019s traded, so it becomes a perpetual revenue stream for artists and rights holders.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, it seems that HitPiece did not notify artists that NFTs of their work were being sold on the platform, nor did they confirm that these artists wanted NFTs of their music in the first place \u2014 which appears to be at the core of most user's backlash.&nbsp;<\/span>","\"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yo <\/span><span class=\"r-18u37iz\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a class=\"css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" dir=\"ltr\" role=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/joinhitpiece\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@joinhitpiece.<\/a> <\/span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Someone has minted my work as NFTs on your website without my approval.<\/span><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Please remove these immediately.
