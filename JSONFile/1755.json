And so you won\u2019t really see us leveraging Ripple in our core markets,\u201D said Lisy.","Intermex CFO Tony Lauro also made a similar statement. He said Ripple solutions have \u201Cmore applicability for us outside of Mexico, where we\u2019re building out our network into other corridors.\u201D","Notably, Ripple, at the time of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/54987\/ripple-inks-new-deal-with-remittance-firm-intermex-which-will-utilize-its-xrp-payments-solution\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">partnership<\/a> announcement, <a href=\"https:\/\/ripple.com\/insights\/enabling-faster-cross-border-payments-between-the-us-and-mexico\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>: \u201CIntermex to leverage RippleNet for faster, transparent cross-border remittance services between the United States and Mexico.\u201D","That does not appear to be the case right now. Instead, Intermex looks to utilize Ripple solutions to bring growth in \u201Cnewer markets,\u201D said Lizy.","\u201CI think it will bring us more growth in newer markets in places where we\u2019re exploring going into ancillary products, but probably not in our core business because those are really critical where we differentiate ourselves from others because of the kind of volume we drive and the relationships we\u2019ve built over the years with direct relationships,\u201D said Lizy.","Intermex partnered with Ripple to use its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, which leverages XRP to settle cross-border payments.&nbsp;","The remittance firm, however, is yet to test the solution. Lauro said the testing would begin \u201Clater this year.\u201D","As a result, Intermex is not sure as to what extent Ripple solutions will be \u201Cviable,\u201D either from a \u201Crate perspective or a capital efficiency perspective.\u201D <br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nIf it turns out to be viable, \"we'll expand it.
