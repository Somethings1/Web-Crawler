The San Francisco-based startup <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/compound-finance\/announcing-compound-open-oracle-development-cff36f06aad3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> on Monday the release of the \u201COpen Oracle System,\u201D a community project that enables developers to contribute and leverage pricing data from a distributed price feed. A price oracle is an entity that provides real-world data to a decentralized network, such as pricing data from a centralized exchange for a decentralized lending platform.","According to Compound, its protocol, like many other DeFi protocols, rely on price feeds that are typically maintained by a centralized group of people or an entity. In Compound\u2019s case, its price feed oracles are maintained and selected by its team. In MakerDAO\u2019s case, the price feed oracles are maintained by a set of <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/developer.makerdao.com\/feeds\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/developer.makerdao.com\/feeds\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">anonymous reporters<\/a>. This results in single points of failure for these projects.","\u201CWe believe that innovation in DeFi will accelerate dramatically when everyone has access to better, easier, more consistent prices, which will benefit the Compound protocol and Ethereum cooperatively.\u201D Robert Leshner, founder of Compound, tells The Block. \u201CIt\u2019s also necessary for Compound to become fully decentralized.\u201D","Open Oracle System works as follows:","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A mockup interface of the Open Oracle System<\/span>","According to Leshner, \u201CThe Open Oracle project is really about transparency. Making it clear exactly who is attesting to a fact by storing that data under Reporter\u2019s public key gives transparency.\u201D While the project is intended for anyone to contribute prices to, the initial batch of reporters will be Compound, DeFi projects, exchanges, OTC desks, and application developers.","A prototype of the project is <a href=\"https:\/\/rinkeby.etherscan.io\/address\/0x64316d763d3925d12678778b0586a01318b44eab\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">running<\/a> on the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet. The prototype publishes data from three reporters: Coinbase Pro, Kraken, and Binance."],"hashtag":[]}
