On Tuesday, Gabriel Shipton, Julian Assange's brother and a core contributor of AssangeDAO, <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.assangedao.org\/t\/assange-family-unit-maximum-bid\/73\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">submitted a proposal<\/a> on the DAO's governance forum that AssangeDAO must put its max bid on the Clock NFT. \"We believe that this is the best outcome for AssangeDAO to assist Julian Assange's liberation,\" he wrote in the proposal at the time.","While many within the AssangeDAO community were against the max bid, Assange's family expressed their support, and the key players signed off on the transaction, said O'Leary, who has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/132991\/a-dao-trying-to-free-julian-assange-has-raised-4-million-and-counting\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">partial control<\/a> over the funds held by AssangeDAO.","The Clock NFT won by AssangeDAO is part of Pak x Julian Assange's NFT collection called <a href=\"https:\/\/censored.art\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Censored<\/a>.","Clock is a single NFT. It is a muted timer counting the number of days Assange has spent in prison. Assange was arrested in 2019 in London and faces potential extradition to the US. Proceeds raised from the NFT sale will go toward Assange's legal fees.","The second part of the Censored NFT collection was an open edition, exhibiting buyers' <a href=\"https:\/\/censored.art\/message\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tokenized messages<\/a>. Anyone could choose to pay whatever they want for a tokenized message. Over 29,000 tokenized messages were created by buyers or \"vanguards\" in the edition.
