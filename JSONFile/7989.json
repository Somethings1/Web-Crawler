It also noted that its quick movement to remain compliant was made to prioritize the safety of the community. Dapper Labs was contacted for comment but did not respond by press time.&nbsp;","The Block previously reported that Dapper Labs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175639\/dapper-labs-freezes-funds-in-wallets-with-russian-ties-following-eu-sanctions-users-say\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">froze<\/a> accounts with ties to Russia on October 7 after obtaining emails sent to affected users.","Dapper claims that it is \"working to provide support to the maximum extent permitted by law as well as identifying solutions for account holders.\" One such solution is the construction of \"alternative NFT custody solutions\" to afford users the ability to move NFTs off of Dapper.","Dapper is not alone in taking action against Russian-tied accounts, in line with new EU sanctions.
