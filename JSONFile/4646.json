Over the years, DeFi and decentralized exchanges (DEXes) had become more user-friendly through the growth and development of platforms such as dYdX and Uniswap. However, one vertical in DeFi remains inefficient, inaccessible, and full of hacks - the cross-chain bridges.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MAP Protocol - where a secure and fully decentralized cross-chain journey begins<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Before we dig into MAP Protocol, let\u2019s talk about blockchain interoperability.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">All blockchains are independent ledgers. Each chain has its own consensus mechanism, data structure, security algorithm, and ledger type, thus making it difficult for them to talk with one another. Interoperability aims to resolve communication silos, allowing different blockchains to communicate and interact so that users can send information, metadata, and assets from one chain to another.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cross-chain, transferring assets or data from one chain to another, is an essential mechanism for users to achieve interoperability. Still, the existing cross-chain solutions are mostly based on centralized or quasi-centralized technologies which resulted in a lot of ongoing hacks.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MAP Protocol revolutionizes cross-chain technologies and engineered a fully decentralized, provably secure, interoperable, efficient, and composable Omnichain Network that can integrate any blockchain, EVMs, or non-EVMs.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The team behind this revolutionary project are devoted engineers that spent 4 years on this fully decentralized Omnichain dream.

This will allow a near instant (only limited by block confirmation time on chains) bridge between these two top blockchains in a fully decentralized and provably secure manner, without any designated third-party MPCs (Multi-Party Computation) or oracles.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The first project to be built on this Omnichain is Butter, a cross-chain token bridge.
