Bids were due earlier this afternoon, the Post said, citing two people familiar with the auction.","Without a rescue or purchase, companies that banked at SVB may have difficulty meeting payroll, and checks or wires initiated right before the bank\u2019s collapse may fail. (SVB was CoinDesk's bank.)","The price of bitcoin rose on the news of a possible rescue or purchase, jumping to as high as $21,582.26.
