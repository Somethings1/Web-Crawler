Withdrawing a token from exchanges is a highly unusual step, although controlling liquidity in this way can limit the ability of short sellers to bet against tron. It also ensures the Tron DAO can maintain a large reserve of tron, with which to redeem USDD holders looking to sell.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whenever USDD drops below its dollar peg it puts inflationary pressure on tron as more tokens are created to defend the peg.
