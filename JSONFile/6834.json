The licenses now allow the company to expand its services, the spokesperson added.","\"These licenses allow Binance to expand the products and services offered including options tailored to the needs of our customers in El Salvador,\" Daniel Acosta, general manager for Colombia, Central America and Caribbean at Binance, said in the statement. \"It is also a great opportunity to collaborate closely with government authorities to support the adoption of crypto assets in the country, foster financial inclusion, innovation and ensure customer protection.\"","In April, Bitfinex Securities also <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.bitfinex.com\/media-releases\/bitfinex-securities-el-salvador-granted-el-salvadors-first-ever-digital-assets-license\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> it became the first fully regulated digital assets exchange to receive a DASP license in El Salvador.

Earlier this year, the country also passed a law for the issuance of digital assets other than bitcoin. The law brought in a definitive regulatory framework for tokenized securities, altcoins and businesses that wish to transact or offer services focused on digital assets other than bitcoin.","With the El Salvador licenses, Binance now has regulatory approvals and registrations in 18 markets in the world, including France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Dubai. That's \"more than any other crypto exchange,\" Binance said.","Binance is currently in a legal battle with United States regulators.
