This comes amidst a drastic downturn of Curve\u2019s CRV token, which has witnessed a 24% weekly decline and currently trades at $0.57, per <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/curve-dao-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinGecko<\/a>.","Egorov\u2019s loan position, backed by 288.7 million Curve DAO (CRV) tokens, valued at $167 million, has about 62 million USDT borrowed against it, with a health factor of 1.55 \u2014 down from over 1.6 yesterday.","This position has attracted attention from the DeFi community due to its size. It comprises <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234138\/curve-finance-michael-egorov-aave\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">over 30%<\/a> of the total CRV token supply, an alarmingly high stake that, in light of the recent price drop, has sparked concerns of substantial selling pressure on CRV tokens and an increased risk of platform liquidation.","In a bold response to potential liquidation, Gauntlet, a firm specializing in DeFi risk management, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234648\/gauntlet-advises-aave-to-freeze-crv-tokens-deposited-by-wallet-tied-to-curve-finance-founder\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposed<\/a> to the Aave community. They suggest that all CRV tokens on the version 2 platform should be frozen and that the loan-to-value ratio for CRV should be adjusted to zero. This strategy is designed to reduce the risk of accruing bad debt that could arise from Egorov\u2019s loan.","This freeze would necessitate a migration of Egorov\u2019s loan position from Aave\u2019s second version to its third, which is perceived as being better equipped to handle risk management.","Echoing a cautionary sentiment, Egorov commented on the Aave position to The Block, saying, \u201CIt\u2019s better to be a bit more careful with this position on Aave. Even if [the] proposal gets rejected, it's better for me to act as if it was executed.\"","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
