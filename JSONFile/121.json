The game is in its second closed beta period, which limits the number of players, between April 9 and April 22, according to an official release. \"MetalCore\" is expected to launch its open beta by the end of 2024. It will be available on PC on the Epic Games Store, seller of other popular games such as Fortnite.","\"During our first closed beta period, we saw first-hand how interested people are in our game, evidenced by our top player completing over 800 missions with a total of over 13,000 kills,\" said Studio 369 CEO Matt Candler in a release. \"Now, we\u2019re bringing even more fresh players into the MetalCore universe as more than 40% of our Day-1 users were completely new to the game.\u201D&nbsp;","\"MetalCore\" is free-to-play and set in a future where warring factions fight for resources in outer space. Users choose which faction to join, playing against other players or the environment. Though players can opt to forgo web3 elements, the cryptocurrency MCG powers \"MetalCore.\" Players can earn MCG and convert the coin into NFTs. The game has another in-game currency called \"Marks\" earned through in-game contracts, social quests and participating in the game's guild system.&nbsp;","Immutable zkEVM is not to be confused with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.immutable.com\/products\/immutable-zkevm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Immutable X<\/a>.
