Lisk's Layer 2 will focus on real-world assets and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/252775\/solana-depin-projects-gig-economy-next-level\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DePINs<\/a>), according to a statement.","\u201CIntegrating with the Ethereum ecosystem and aligning with industry standards brings us closer to our goal of making blockchain accessible than ever before,\u201D Lisk co-founder Max Kordek said.&nbsp;","Back in the heyday of the 2017 bull market, Lisk was a <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/historical\/20171210\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">top 20<\/a> cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Fast-forward to 2023, and as the blockchain industry has matured, Lisk finds itself comparatively out of favor, falling to 272 in the rankings as its market cap declined <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/?page=3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">83%<\/a> from $919 million to $152 million. With the widespread adoption of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Lisk said it now sees a better opportunity to expedite its mission by migrating to become an Ethereum Layer 2.","The testnet deployment of Lisk\u2019s Layer 2 network is scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 ahead of a mainnet launch, enabling developers to access up to 90% cheaper fees than the Ethereum mainnet, the Lisk team said.","The transition also involves the migration of the LSK token to Ethereum, designed to improve its usability across various dApps and DeFi protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem.&nbsp;","Lisk said existing reward-sharing mechanisms for LSK will continue, with the token also used for on-chain governance in an upcoming Lisk DAO.","Lisk also plans an initial airdrop of LSK tokens to incentivize activity on the new chain, with more details expected leading up to its mainnet launch.","Lisk joins Optimism and the Coinbase-incubated Layer 2 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/247268\/coinbase-base-optimism\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Base<\/a> in utilizing the OP Stack, becoming the first Layer 1 to contribute to the development of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/236277\/optimism-changes-name-to-op-mainnet-in-line-with-superchain-vision\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Optimism Superchain<\/a> network of Layer 2 blockchains, the team said.","\u201CLisk\u2019s transition to the OP Stack underscores our conviction that Layer 2s are the path to scaling not just Ethereum, but the blockchain movement itself,\u201D Optimism Foundation Chief Scientist Ben Jones added.","Lisk is also collaborating with Ethereum rollup-as-a-service platform Gelato to build the Layer 2, allowing it to deploy the OP chain in just a few clicks without writing any additional code. Gelato will let Lisk integrate infrastructure and web3 services such as block explorers, bridges and oracles from launch.","\u201CUsing Gelato\u2019s Rollup-as-a-Service platform allows the Lisk research and development team to be primarily focused on building additional products and tooling that developers and end users love, while also committing resources to the Superchain\u2019s development,\u201D Lisk Chief Project Officer Dominic Schwenter said.","The collaboration follows an expansion of Gelato\u2019s platform, also announced today, to include OP Stack support in addition to Polygon CDK.","\u201CWe have known the team since our early days together in Berlin, and are excited to finally be able to work together more closely,\u201D Gelato co-founder Hilmar Orth said. \u201CBy embracing Ethereum's ecosystem and porting its existing community onto a powerful Layer 2 blockchain using Gelato, we are collectively shaping the future of web3 scalability. The Lisk ecosystem will benefit greatly from better access to liquidity, developers and sequencing fee revenue generated from its Layer 2 blockchain.\u201D","\"We are excited that Gelato has extended support to the Superchain as a RaaS provider for Lisk, making it easier for developers to onboard new users into the Superchain ecosystem,\" Optimism Foundation\u2019s Ben Jones added.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
