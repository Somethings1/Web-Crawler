But the more energy the Bank spends on this question, the more likely it is that we will see some form of a digital pound made reality,\u201D said Richard Hay, U.K. head of fintech at Linklaters, the law firm.","Monday morning, the Bank of England published an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/paper\/2021\/new-forms-of-digital-money\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in-depth discussion paper<\/a> encompassing topics ranging from the prospect of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to stablecoins. The paper poses a series of questions about the role and potential impact of such currencies, with readers invited to respond by September 7.","Sarah Coles, an analyst at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank is in \u201Cno hurry\u201D to move into digital currencies, because \u201Cit needs to be sure that creating its own digital currency wouldn\u2019t do more harm than good.\u201D","Etay Katz, a partner at the law firm Ashurst, agreed that \u201Cit is right that there is a careful reflection before adding money substitutes or digital money schemes to the mainstream,\u201D but warned that hesitation \u201Cwill increase the risk of less thought through schemes gaining prominence with potential systemic perils.\u201D","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Further exploration<\/strong>","Within the paper, the Bank said it would <a href=\"https:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/currencies\/news\/britcoin-cbdc-digital-pound-under-exploration-bank-of-england-says-2021-6-1030499080\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">deepen its exploration<\/a> into whether to issue a digital version of the pound \u2013 a so-called Britcoin.","\u201CA CBDC could play an important role in sustaining, and potentially expanding, retail access to central bank money,\u201D the Bank stated in the paper. But a final decision remains some way off, it stressed, despite its recent efforts to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/103424\/bank-of-england-hiring-cbdc-team\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">beef up<\/a> its CBDC expertise.","Another key takeaway from the paper was the action on stablecoins mooted by the Bank. The Bank acknowledged the potential for stablecoins \u2013 a form of digital currency pegged to the value of fiat currencies \u2013 \u201Cto become widely used as a means of retail payment.\u201D","But it also stated that stablecoin payments should be regulated in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/finance\/boe-says-stablecoin-payments-need-same-regulation-banks-2021-06-07\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the same way as bank payments<\/a> if that potential is realised.","\u201CFurther work will be required to consider the resolution arrangements for systemic stablecoins.
