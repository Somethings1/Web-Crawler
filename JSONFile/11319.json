Bitcoin traded around $30,450 just minutes after the release \u2014 which SoFi's Liz Young, head of investment strategy, called \"soft-ish.\"","Stock futures pumped shortly after the release, while U.S. stock indices were slightly more subdued after the open, although still in the green. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.37%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.07%.","The market's initial reaction to the inflation data might be ill-conceived, according to some analysts. Michael Brown, a market analyst at TraderX, said it might be folly to ignore the re-acceleration in core inflation back up to 5.6% year-on-year. The rise in core inflation is a sign of price pressures getting embedded and growing stickier, he added.&nbsp;","","","The Fed may well end hikes after May, Brown added, but any chance of cuts is unlikely given the central bank's reluctance to let genie out of the bottle a second time, he concluded.","Michael Hewson, the chief market analyst at CMC markets, echoed this. \"Markets drawing the wrong conclusions from today's numbers, methinks, he said in response to Brown's <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MrMBrown\/status\/1646130828479545346?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweet<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;","Fed Funds futures pricing now shows a 67% probability of a 25 basis point increase at next month's meeting, down from 73% this morning.
