It underscores the role that sound, professional journalism can play in bringing transparency to the too-often-opaque and, sadly, scam-ridden crypto industry.","As Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker and Executive Editor Marc Hochstein put it in their write-up of the three award-winning stories (Ian\u2019s initial scoop on Alameda\u2019s balance sheet, his followup on Binance being likely to withdraw its bailout and Tracy\u2019s bombshell on CEO Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s \u201Ccabal of roommates\u201D that ran FTX): \u201CThere is little precedent in journalism history for a story that made such an impact and did it so quickly.\u201D","It\u2019s painful to see so many FTX victims in the fallout from what Ian and Tracy uncovered. But the reality is it would have eventually been exposed. That it wasn\u2019t earlier is, in fact, the problem. It\u2019s why a professional, independent media is vital for an industry with trust issues.","But it takes a technical grounding to cover this complex topic properly. Just as bankers exploited miscomprehension of collateralized debt obligations pre-2008, crypto scammers hide behind techno-fog. That can be challenging for reporters unfamiliar with the tech. It\u2019s why some mainstream coverage of Bankman-Fried left a lot to be desired.","Here, CoinDesk is unique. Sure, there are quality crypto reporters in mainstream media as well as in the crypto press, but no outlet has nearly as deep a bench as we do. We combine the best of mainstream and crypto journalism.","We are led by Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds in editorial, who had a storied 23-year career at Bloomberg, and by Joanne Po, executive producer and head of multimedia, who led TV and digital multimedia teams at CNBC, The Wall Street Journal and Fox Digital. We have other senior editors with decades of newsroom experience. Just as importantly, we employ many scoop-hungry, crypto-native reporters \u2013 some of them straight out of school, others older \u2013 with deep, personal understanding of the technology and its opportunities and challenges.","This two-way approach is more important than ever. Contrary to its critics, crypto isn\u2019t going anywhere. But, clearly, it needs to be improved, both on the technical side and in the regulatory framework. If it is to live up to its transformative potential, it\u2019s vital that crypto\u2019s problems be exposed, so that solutions can be iteratively developed and so that promising projects are given the attention they deserve.","It has become popular in some crypto circles to argue that this should be left to solo \u201Ccitizen journalists\u201D on Twitter. But while there\u2019s definitely a place for the crowdsourcing of information that happens on social media, Ian and Tracy\u2019s work is Exhibit A in the case for why independent, structured press organizations like CoinDesk remain vital.","Until someone comes up with something better \u2013 perhaps, one day, a workable, trusted decentralized system for uncovering facts and holding bad actors accountable \u2013 there\u2019s no substitute for the training or the embedded principles of professional journalism with which reporters develop trust with sources, report accurately and work with integrity.","Do we occasionally get things wrong? Sure. But there\u2019s a commitment, day in and day out, to endeavor to get it right, promptly correct and disclose our mistakes and strive for objectivity and transparency. The best way to address the conspiracy theorists who blindly claim we serve some puppet master\u2019s interests is to point to the proof in our pudding.","Today is therefore not only a day to celebrate Ian and Tracy and their editor, Nick Baker, but every single person at CoinDesk. They have all contributed to a workplace that allows and encourages our journalists to pursue these high standards \u2013 one result of which is this highly deserved accolade. It\u2019s a day, also, to recognize why it\u2019s so important that the wider crypto industry supports media institutions like CoinDesk that live by these principles."],"entity":[{"type":"Tracy\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"November","content":"DATE"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Marc Hochstein","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Joanne Po","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tracy","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fox Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tracy Wang","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kevin Reynolds","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ian Allison","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ian","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["CoinDesk","Journalism","Opinion"],"authors":["Michael J.
