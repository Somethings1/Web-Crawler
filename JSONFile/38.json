For example, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/283190\/solana-memecoin-presales-continue-to-see-interest-despite-industry-leaders-expressing-concerns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">posted<\/a> on X that \"memecoins harm the industry,\" adding: \"It's frustrating to see billion-dollar-cap memecoins overshadow hardworking teams building legit products to advance this industry.\"","At the same time, memecoins have once again drawn the attention of regulators \u2014 particularly the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/285019\/memecoin-finfluencers-are-falling-under-the-financial-conduct-authoritys-regulatory-spotlight\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued a warning<\/a> earlier this week explaining that so-called \"finfluencers\" on social media must have approval from an FCA-appointed representative prior to advertising or posting memes about financial products or services, including crypto."],"hashtag":["VITALIK BUTERIN"]}
