In October 2021, the company announced that it completed a $100 million Series A financing round, which values the company at $1.5 billion.","","","To help with the process, Candy is set up with a fiat-first approach, meaning purchasing an NFT can be done by simply going to their website, putting in an email address and paying with a credit card.","Products previously sold on Bitski and OpenSea will not be featured in the marketplace for this launch, but Candy plans to roll-out additional crypto-native features and provides owners the opportunity to bridge those NFTs to the Candy platform.","\u201COver the course of the next few months on our roadmap, all the crypto functionality around being able to connect to wallet, pay with crypto, ultimately bridge your asset onto Ethereum and other chains are all things that we will continue to roll out,\u201D said Lawin."],"hashtag":[]}
