In his view, it's not just replicating what exists in centralized finance and putting it on the blockchain:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe products that do really well in DeFi are not just straight up, \u2018take a centralized finance thing, make the closest clone you can, and then try to get people to use it\u2026\u2019 that pretty much never works in DeFi. It's always something that's somewhat adapted to the nuances of crypto systems and how people interact with crypto systems in a way that's very different than traditional finance or even centralized crypto.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Successful DeFi projects must handle what Chitra describes as the \"degen ape,\" referring to crypto power users. These market participants erratically move large sums of money into decentralized protocols without researching the protocol\u2019s underlying fundamentals:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAnd so what you find in DeFi in particular, is that there's almost this gladiator like competition between these different protocols and the capital that's getting allocated to them\u2026 If there is some truth to the fact that their mechanism works, you effectively should - whether or not it's a really informed or perfectly rational investor putting their money into a protocol or whether it's a degen ape - you should basically get the same outcome.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DeFi protocols with billions in TVL currently rely on Gauntlet\u2019s risk modeling for their operations, including Aave, a lending protocol whose founder and CEO Stani Kulechov recently <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/139071\/are-funds-safu-mitigating-defi-risk-with-aave-founder-stani-kulechov\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shared<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> with The Scoop how the protocol\u2019s V3 upgrade is mitigating risk.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In time, Chitra believes increasingly more forms of contracts will fall under the purview of DeFi:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI don't think DeFi really revolutionizes finance per se. I think it revolutionizes lawyers. You just get rid of lawyers for a lot of transactions\u2026 Somehow in DeFi, you're able to make these things like - the tokenization means that you can turn these things that were legal contracts into like exchange tradable assets.\u201D<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this Episode, Chaparro and Chitra also discuss:<\/span><\/i>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fireblocks.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/coinbase.com\/prime\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase Prime<\/a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/crossriver.com\/crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cross River<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.
