The agency\u2019s enforcement arm said at the time that a Form S-1 registration statement filed by American CryptoFed failed to contain required information about its business management and financial condition. It also had materially misleading statements and omissions, including inconsistencies on whether the tokens are securities, the SEC said.","Xiaomeng also told the judge that the SEC won\u2019t allow the registration of potential securities while at the same time not proving whether or not the tokens are securities.","American CryptoFed is representing itself in the hearing. During an appearance in early December, the DAO argued that the SEC treated it unfairly by choosing to accelerate enforcement without providing it an opportunity to work through its filings and resolve issues with the agency\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance, according to a post about the hearing from law firm Baker McKenzie.","The hearing will continue into Thursday after recessing today over disagreements over what the DAO could present to the judge.","Â© 2023 The Block.
