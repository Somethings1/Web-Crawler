Latency is the round-trip delay and we define it as the time between a trading request (e.g., add order) being sent by client systems and it being acknowledged by the exchange.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Unlike traditional exchanges, crypto venues are generally less geographically concentrated and don\u2019t offer full colocation. In many cases, they are entirely cloud-based.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Latency-sensitive clients will deploy code wherever it is most physically proximate to the venue. Therefore, a fair comparison includes measuring latency from the region most relevant for that specific venue.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Latency will also vary between trading requests, even on a persistent connection between a single client and the exchange. This is due to both differences and variability in internet-based trading, as well as how the exchange is handling load.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Here you see Kraken\u2019s best-path P25 latency (25% of all trading requests had a latency at or under the milliseconds indicated) versus some of our top competitors in different regions, normalized for location, during a March baseline measurement.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Our baseline round-trip latency of about 2.5ms represents a 97% improvement vs. Q1 2021.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As mentioned before, real-world performance under heavy load is as important, if not more important, than best case performance and absolute latency figures.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Improving execution cost, reducing slippage, and managing market risk depends on minimizing the <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">variability<\/span><\/i><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> of latency between each trading request. We call this variability jitter, and we measure the difference between different latency percentile figures for the same sampling time frame.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">By measuring jitter with P25 and P95 latencies, we capture a significant performance range and observed behavior over time. For example, we measured how our jitter compared with top competitors during the week of November 5-12, 2022, when market volatility was acute due to unraveling of FTX.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Our trading infrastructure performed exceptionally well, despite the dramatically increased volatility and load. Our jitter never exceeded 30ms. Other exchanges slowed to several hundred milliseconds, or requests timing out entirely as indicated by the vertical spikes.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Throughput reflects the number of successful trading requests (add order, cancel order, edit order, etc.) handled by an exchange in a given amount of time.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Similar to latency, we discuss throughput in either theoretical or observed terms.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Observed throughput is more relevant since it reflects many interrelated factors including rate limits. We set these limits to prevent DDoS attacks and keep traffic comfortably within theoretical limits.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Here we\u2019ve illustrated the over 4x improvement in our maximum observed throughput (Q1 2021 vs. Q1 2023). Already increased from 250k requests\/min to over 1mm, there is significant headroom left between this level and our dramatically improved theoretical maximum throughput.<\/span>","","","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kraken.com\/en-gb\/features\/api-trading?utm_source=theblock&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-content&amp;utm_campaign=2023_q2_inst_us_block-api_lgn_per_id:na&amp;utm_content=link_contact-us_id:na\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Contact us<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to learn more about how Kraken API can work for you.<\/span>","&nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by Kraken <\/i><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
