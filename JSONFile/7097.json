He noted that while Bitcoin has rebounded from below $20,000 to around $27,000, there's a bit less space for more volatile investments in general because interest rates are ramping up. He added that people are leaning toward having a 5% yield that's more certain.","\"So you can see that overall, despite the fact that Tether grew in market cap, you see the entire stablecoin market as a sum it went down I think 23% from the all-time highs because in the end people prefer to sit on their dollars and earn interest on it, and so that also leaves less space, less liquidity to actually reinvest that liquidity in the crypto markets,\" he said.","But he put forward one possible optimistic path forward. \"And so it\u2019s kind of multi-factor, but definitely if we are starting to see the US inflation numbers going down, if the Fed will stop ramping up the interest rates, I believe that we will be in a situation where the markets will start healing, not just the crypto market, the market in general,\" he said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
