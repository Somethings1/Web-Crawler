The airdrop will be based on the number of points each member has earned. The developer airdrop is scheduled for January 2024 when the testnet launches while the airdrop for community members will be in May.","Though users can already earn 3-4% by separately staking ether, Blast said the baseline interest rate on existing Layer 2s is 0%, with the value of assets depreciating against inflation over time. With Blast\u2019s native yield, users\u2019 balances compound automatically, offering 4% for ether and 5% for stablecoins, alongside rewards known as \u201CBlast Points,\u201D the team said.","More specifically, Blast said it natively participates in staking ether and passes the yield on to the Layer 2\u2019s users and dapps, with their balances automatically growing over time.","Additionally, Blast offers stablecoins yields on USDC, USDT and DAI, which are deposited in on-chain T-Bill protocols like MakerDAO with the yield passed back to users in the form of USDB \u2014 Blast\u2019s auto-rebasing stablecoin.","Over $30 million has bridged to the Layer 2 since launch, according to a Dune Analytics <a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/wumbonft\/blast\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">dashboard<\/a>. This includes over 13,000 ETH ($26 million), $3.4 million in DAI, $2.3 million in USDC and $900,000 in USDT.","According to a separate <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PacmanBlur\/status\/1726756296094073040\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">post<\/a> by Roquerre, there is $100 million of total value locked in Blur\u2019s bidding pool not earning yield, and a Layer 2 was the answer. \u201CA new L2 with native yield for dapps and users would allow the Blur ecosystem to avoid asset depreciation, reduce NFT transaction costs and launch NFT perps,\" he said.","Despite the apparent demand, the platform has received criticism over how its model is structured and marketed.","Invite-only early access members are offered more points based on how much they bridge and who they invite to rank further up the leaderboard, according to a screenshot shared by Tytan.eth on X and verified by The Block. Members get rewards from those they invite, and then a smaller portion of rewards from people that their invitees then invite. Some have <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/Tytaninc\/status\/1726849555281633565?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">likened<\/a> it to a Pyramid scheme.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blast has a points scheme that rewards individuals who get their referees to invite more people.
