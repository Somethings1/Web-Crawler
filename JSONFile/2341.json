Magic Eden <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162535\/magic-eden-submits-proposal-to-build-apecoindao-an-nft-marketplace\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">last week<\/a> made a similar proposal for a marketplace with low transaction fees, also at no cost to the DAO. A third contender, startup Snag Solution, also <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.apecoin.com\/t\/a-community-first-apecoin-dao-marketplace-proposal\/8079\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">submitted a proposal<\/a> hours after the publication of Magic Eden's.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nIn each case, the marketplace would be primarily for buying and selling NFTs from Yuga Labs. Although the DAO is populated by holders of Yuga's NFTs, which includes the Bored Ape Yacht Club, it is not controlled by it.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\"Bored Apes, and the whole Yuga ecosystem, is a crown jewel of NFT projects on Ethereum,\" Evgeniy Medvedev, Rarible's head of partnerships told The Block. \u201CWe definitely want to be there.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nHigh transaction fees have led to demand for bespoke marketplaces as scams abound and communities lack control of collections. Marketplaces like Rarible and Magic Eden have started offering services to create white label marketplaces that give brands more dominance over the sales of their NFTs and make it harder to pass off fakes.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\"We want to reduce the number of scams in the space, and this is a way we can do it,\" said Medvedev. \u201CYou are also not depending on the centralized marketplaces [which could] delist your collection.\u201D<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe proposals will now make their way through the ApeCoin DAO's governance system. Magic Eden told The Block that so far the response to their proposal has been really positive.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n\u201CRarible\u2019s submission is a reflection of a healthy DAO ecosystem and we welcome the competition,\u201D a Magic Eden spokesperson said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
