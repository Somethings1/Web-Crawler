Thus, if one surface is affected somehow, it will only affect the APIs or functionality that the particular surface is responsible for, instead of taking down the entire system.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The outage on January 6th and 7th was triggered by record-high traffic from crypto price movement, according to Coinbase, which led to \u201Ca thundering herd of requests.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CSeveral of our downstream services were hit with traffic that they were underprovisioned for, and client retry behavior on the application server compounded the issue, rapidly issuing retry requests to the services,\u201D the exchange said. \u201CThis retry storm prevented some parts of our app from functioning.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The issue also happened because of problems with MongoDB clusters, which are responsible for handling the exchange\u2019s high data volumes. Essentially, the MongoDB clusters were experiencing long delays when queried, causing newer queries to be further delayed. The team triggered a failover on these \u201Cunhealthy\u201D clusters, which momentarily returned them to a healthy state. However, the clusters would regress back to unhealthy status within ten minutes. Thus, users were only able to use their apps for short periods of time.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to the announcement, the Coinbase team plans to break MongoDB clusters which carry \u201Clarge discrete miscellaneous collections\u201D into separate clusters, which will also make it harder to take down the entire system in the event something like this happens again.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase maintains that despite the server being overwhelmed, users were still able to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The outage is one of several technical issues the exchange has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/status.coinbase.com\/history\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">faced<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in recent months, while also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/90882\/monday-binance-coinbase-exchange-volume\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">breaking its all-time-highs for volume<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Most recently, on January 11, Coinbase Support <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CoinbaseSupport\/status\/1348664714587369472\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that they were investigating an issue impacting transactions on their website and mobile apps.
