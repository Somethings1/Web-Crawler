But Elliptic has traced illicit funds (from hacks etc) that have been moved through DEXs and bridges in order to obfuscate their origin,\u201D a spokesperson for Elliptic told The Block.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In its report, Elliptic researchers broke down its findings for each of these blockchain tools, starting with DEXs. Since 2020, DEXs have facilitated the movement of $1.2 billion in ill-gotten assets, Elliptic said. DEXs are protocols that let users execute buy and sell orders with the help of smart contracts. The use of DEXs by criminals is closely associated with exploits in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and hacks of centralized exchanges, the firm reported.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/163612\/why-are-cross-chain-bridges-prime-targets-for-hackers-and-what-can-we-do-about-it\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cross-chain bridges<\/a> are the second kind of tool found by Elliptic to be popular among criminals<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. Here, the Elliptic researchers reported that since 2020, criminals have funneled nearly $750 million of illicit funds via cross-chain bridges, an activity referred to as \u201Cchain hopping\u201D by Elliptic. These bridges let users transfer assets among blockchain networks. The vast majority of these illicit assets moving through bridges (over $540 million) have been processed by RenBridge, a cross-chain bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum.<\/span>","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/exploits\/largest-defi-exploits\/embed\" title=\"Largest DeFi exploits\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The report went on to explain criminals use blockchain-based tools like DEXs and bridges primarily for money laundering or to obfuscate their on-chain activity so it\u2019s harder to catch them. Both strategies serve to obfuscate transaction trails and make investigations more difficult.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The third tool detailed in the report are \u201Ccoin swaps\u201D or non-KYC cryptocurrency swap services. These allow users to swap assets both within and across blockchains without opening an account. According to Elliptic, coin swaps are mostly advertised on Russian cybercrime forums and cater almost exclusively to a criminal audience. These account for $1.2 billion in illicit transactions since 2020.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
