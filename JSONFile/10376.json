A soft landing for the economy, Fed rate cuts, and a contentious presidential election should be a supportive macro backdrop for bitcoin,\" Pandl said in a note sent to The Block.","YouHodler Chief of Markets, Ruslan Lienkha, suggested that the price of bitcoin will continue to maintain a long-term upward trend, viewing the recent correction as the digital asset \"taking a breather\" ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech today.","\"We may see price consolidation for a while, plus or minus $10,000 from current levels, before the next price hike to a new all-time high happens. Thus, now is just another opportunity to accumulate the long position for long-term investors,\" Lienkha told The Block.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
