Such a rule could be a problem for centralized exchanges or any platform that manages clients\u2019 assets. Exchanges typically hold customer funds in commingled accounts and credit customers for their value, rather than providing an individual wallet for each customer. The SEC's proposal would make that illegal. The proposal might also ban investors from using an unqualified third party to store their clients' funds.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Grayscale controls the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which it claims are the largest crypto funds of their kind. GBTC holds $17.4 billion and ETH holds about $5.6 billion, the company told The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, the entirety of those funds is held by Coinbase via the Coinbase Custody Trust Company, Sonnenshein told the SEC.

Coinbase custody is a qualified custodian and will likely remain so under the new rule.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Previously, Grayscale stored cold wallets via a company called Xapo Inc. \u201CXapo\u2019s custody model relied on geographically dispersed physical vault locations around the world, which changed regularly,\u201D he wrote.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAs an institutional-grade asset manager, we do not ourselves custody client assets. Instead, we engage expert third-party custodians to provide this service, as is the norm for traditional asset managers. In our ten years of operation, our custodians have never experienced a loss of client assets,\u201D Sonnenshein told the SEC.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In traditional finance, custody of assets has often been held by a separate banking bodies from the brokers and clearing houses who place deals and trades. But many crypto businesses have grown up without divisions, and custody, brokering and clearing are done by the same platforms. That has made the more efficient, Grayscale chief legal officer Craig Salm told The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Imposing tradfi rules on crypto might add in unnecessary time-lags and inefficiencies, Salm said. \u201CAs the largest digital currency asset manager with the longest-running track record , we would caution the SEC against taking any action that would impose additional burdens without adding any benefits,\u201D Salm said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCoinbase Custody also uses specific, industry leading practices in its policies, procedures, and controls for safekeeping and maintaining exclusive possession or control over digital assets that it custodies to protect against the theft, loss, and unauthorized and accidental use of the private keys necessary to access and transfer the digital assets it holds in custody,\u201D Sonnenshein\u2019s letter to the SEC says.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIn short, the methods that we and others rely on to safeguard client assets work, and we caution the Commission against taking action that would impose significant new costs, risks, and burdens without added benefit.\u201D<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229944\/a16z-sec-crypto-regulation-investment-advisers-coinbase\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase has also complained about the proposed rule<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. \u201CThe proposal would ban [registered investment advisers] from trading on non-QC [qualified custodian] crypto exchanges,\" Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said in a tweet yesterday. \"This wouldn\u2019t benefit RIAs or their clients and would in fact harm them. Thus the SEC should allow limited non-QC exposure so RIAs can trade crypto for their clients.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC\u2019s comment period closes this month.<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Correction: The original version of this story incorrectly described the effect of the SEC\u2019s proposed rule change on qualified custodians. The proposals are unlikely to affect Grayscale or Coinbase because Coinbase would remain a qualified custodian under the rule change. The story also understated the size of the assets under management at Grayscale.<\/span><\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
