When asked if she had reached an agreement with Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the committee\u2019s top Republican and chair-in-waiting for the committee, on a subpoena for Bankman-Fried, Waters said, \u201CWe have not gotten to that point yet, but I think it\u2019s plausible.\u201D","Another senior Democrat on the committee, Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, told The Block that the committee is considering the maneuver the maneuver to compel Bankman-Fried to testify during the next Congress if he did not appear before the current one ends.&nbsp;","A spokesperson for McHenry did not immediately provide comment on the possibility.","The means to enforce congressional subpoenas for nongovernmental figures are limited. Technically the House Sergeant-at-Arms, who helps oversee the U.S. Capitol Police, can arrest individuals who do not comply with congressional subpoenas for contempt of Congress. But such subpoenas can be tied up in legal wrangling, and contempt charges are typically referred to the Justice Department \u2013 which has already begun an investigation into FTX over dealings leading up to the collapse \u2013 for enforcement.","Democrats on the committee held a briefing on FTX with Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler that stretched for over two hours on Tuesday night. Committee Republicans named him as a witness they would like to hear speak publicly.","\u201CWe ought to have the SEC in. Gary Gensler hasn\u2019t been here for over a year \u2013 it was a year ago in October,\u201D said Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., the lead Republican on the Capital Markets Subcommittee.","Rep. Blaine Leutkemeyer, R-Mo., agreed. \u201CWhy was the SEC asleep at the wheel during all this?\u201D&nbsp;","While leaving his meeting with committee Democrats, Gensler declined to comment on whether he would testify next week. At least one senior Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, worried how successful the panel would be in obtaining testimony from former FTX executives for the much-anticipated hearing next week.","\u201CI\u2019m worried that there\u2019s going to be a lot less than meets the eye. You had behavior that in this country would be criminal,\u201D Himes said. \u201CIt would shock me if lawyers would allow any of them to turn up without some sort of immunity agreement but it would be nice to hear from them as well.\u201D","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
