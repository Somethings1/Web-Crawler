The St. Louis Fed has been tracking the price of a dozen eggs using bitcoin as a unit of measure since last summer. Since bitcoin is worth considerably more than a dozen eggs, the reserve bank multiplied the price by 100 million to express it in satoshis.","In March, the average price of a carton of eggs fell to 13,714 satoshis, or 0.00013714 BTC ($3.88), dropping 24% compared to about 18,077 satoshis in February. In January, a carton of eggs cost over 23,800.","A satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin, worth 0.00000001 BTC. As such, the average price charged for 12 eggs fell to about 0.00013714 BTC, or about $3.88, based on the average price on March 31, according to the St. Louis Fed's data.","","","The cost of eggs in the U.S. hit all-time highs (in dollar terms) in 2022 as inflation soared and the food product drew media attention.
