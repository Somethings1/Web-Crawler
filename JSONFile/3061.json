The President\u2019s Working Group is a joint effort involving the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. However, the Treasury Secretary \u2014 currently Janet Yellen \u2014 chairs the President's Working Group (PWG).&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Given that the PWG\u2019s stablecoin concerns focused on prudential risk \u2014 specifically, whether these tokens are verifiably backed by appropriate funding \u2014 Yellen delegated the report to Liang.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Beyond summarizing the stablecoin market for policymakers, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/122890\/us-treasury-releases-long-awaited-report-on-stablecoin-risk-features-request-for-new-laws\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">report made recommendations<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> for more transparency in stablecoin reserves and redemption practices.
