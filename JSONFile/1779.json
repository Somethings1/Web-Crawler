But Sun said the two companies are independent and \"haven't had any plan to merge yet.\" However, when asked if a deal could happen in future, he said it \"could be\" possible.","Sun has relations with both Poloniex and Huobi. In 2019, he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/markets\/2019\/11\/12\/despite-denials-tron-founder-confirms-investment-in-poloniex-crypto-exchange\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">confirmed<\/a> an investment in Poloniex after initially denying his involvement.&nbsp;","A similar situation occurred last month when Huobi <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175691\/huobi-will-be-acquired-by-hong-kong-based-about-capital-management\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> the sale of a majority stake to Hong Kong-based investment company About Capital Management. At the time, Wu reported that Sun is the \"real buyer\" of the Huobi stake sale. But Sun <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175867\/justin-sun-denies-being-real-buyer-of-huobi-stake-sale-exclusive\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">denied<\/a> the claim and said he is only an advisor to Huobi. Sun, however, has been at the forefront of recent changes at Huobi.","Earlier this week, he <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/justinsuntron\/status\/1595017618058276864?s=20&amp;t=-5CmGT5CFjnvGxddGu7Akw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">put forth<\/a> strategies for Huobi to reclaim a position among the top three crypto exchanges at the company's rebrand launch event in Singapore.

Poloniex is the sixth-largest. Huobi had a trading volume of about $16 billion last month and Poloniex only around $1 billion during the same period.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/crypto-only-exchange-volume\/embed\" title=\"Crypto-only Exchange Volume\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","If and when the merger of Huobi and Poloniex takes place, it could help further consolidate the crypto industry.
