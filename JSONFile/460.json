Morgan Creek led BlockFi's $50 million series C fundraising round, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/75338\/blockfi-raises-50-million-eyes-potential-spac\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">closed in August of 2020<\/a>. &nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlockFi entered crisis mode last week when the news of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/152574\/blockfi-among-firms-that-liquidated-three-arrows-collateral-ft\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">large loan made to Three Arrows Capital (3AC)<\/a> went public, leading to a rapid withdrawal of customer funds from the platform.

Here are four additional takeaways.<\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Not mentioned in the initial coverage of the call was the fact that the proposed funding round would value BlockFi at less than $500 million.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As Morgan Creek Digital\u2019s managing partner Mark Yusko explained on the call, a $250 million equity offer would buy the investor syndicate 51% ownership, which would reduce the existing equity holders to 49% ownership. This is significant because last fall BlockFi was reportedly raising funds at a $5 billion valuation. That means this equity deal would represent a 90% decrease in value.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For weeks leading up to the 3AC liquidity crunch, BlockFi had been struggling to raise money despite a steep discount on its valuation.

A spokesperson from BlockFi stated that \u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">it would be inappropriate to suggest any claims made outside of official BlockFi or FTX channels as anything more than pure speculation.\u201D<\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On June 16, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince confirmed on Twitter that the firm had liquidated an overcollateralized loan from a large client and that it had hedged all associated collateral.

Later, Morgan Creek co-founder Anthony Pompliano claimed that two-thirds of that was bitcoin, which was immediately seized and liquidated and the remaining third were shares of GBTC. That would be worth roughly $430 million.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAll of this has been reported from them to us,\u201D Pompliano said, referring to BlockFi.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">GBTC, or Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, is a crypto investment product that allows investors to purchase shares in a trust account that holds a large bundle of bitcoin. Some investors choose to buy into the trust, rather than buying bitcoin on the open market, because it works like a traditional financial product in the way that it simplifies taxation, reporting, and trading.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although the product is meant to be pegged to the market value of Bitcoin, shares of GBTC typically trade for a discount, known as the \u201CGrayscale discount,\u201D which, since 2021, has oscillated between 6% and 38%.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to the call, BlockFi was able to easily liquidate its position in Bitcoin but ran into problems with the GBTC because the discount had reached lows last week of nearly 34%. As BlockFi attempted to liquidate its GBTC position, Pompliano explained, the price went down.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Representatives from Morgan Creek and FTX declined to comment on the details of the collateral.
