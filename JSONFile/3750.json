The \u201Csuspended list\u201D would be visible on the public blockchain.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wallet addresses are considered inactive if they took part in the token\u2019s initial distribution phase between July 2020 and June 2022 but have never made an outgoing transaction. In December, the TON community asked the affected wallet owners to demonstrate their continued activity by making a transaction on TON. The remaining inactive wallets can avoid the potential suspension by making a transaction at any time before voting ends. It\u2019s important to note that addresses not part of the initial distribution will not be affected.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The distribution of toncoin made 98.55% of its total supply available for an \u201Cinitial proof-of-work\u201D mechanism. In contrast to centralized distribution strategies often decided upon by crypto project development teams, TON\u2019s mining strategy was designed to decentralize the distribution process while remaining a proof-of-stake blockchain.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The move was a \u201Ctestament to the importance of transparency to the TON community,\u201D the TON Foundation, a non-commercial group of supporters and contributors behind the blockchain, said in a statement. \u201CThrough the potential suspension of these wallets, there is a hope that clarity about the volume of toncoin currently circulating will be provided and that the active community participating in the open-source project will continue to grow and thrive,\u201D it added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Open Network was originally designed in 2018 by the founders of Telegram Messenger and later handed over to the TON community to continue its development.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Earlier this month, TON <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/199494\/telegram-linked-ton-blockchain-launches-decentralized-file-sharing-solution\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> a decentralized file-sharing and data storage solution called TON Storage, taking on similar projects like Filecoin and Storj.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
