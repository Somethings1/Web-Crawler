As well as setting up the bank's Israeli business and running it as regional CEO, she specialized in M&amp;A, financing and investing in private companies \u2014 in particular in the tech sector.&nbsp;She was later involved in bringing the Mandarin Oriental hotel to Tel Aviv.","More recently, Freedman Weissman has performed due diligence on over 50 crypto-focused funds for her family office, she said in an interview with The Block. Of those, she said several made overtures about her coming on board. But it was Lior Messika\u2019s Eden Block that caught her eye.","\u201CEden Block is a true hidden gem,\u201D she said. \u201CI was impressed with the portfolio. I was impressed with the top performance. I love the strategy of early-stage infrastructure.\u201D","Eden Block remains small relative to rivals in the crypto VC world, such as a16z crypto, Paradigm and Polychain. Its first fund to manage outside capital, raised roughly a year and a half ago, is $30 million in size.","But the business has made some promising bets, including the likes of privacy startup Nym Technologies, Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs and Gensyn, the compute power marketplace that just <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234092\/blockchain-compute-power-gensyn-raise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">scored a $43 million Series A round<\/a>. It even has a few exits in the form of Hal, GK8 and Chainspace, which were acquired by Consensys, Celsius and Facebook, respectively.","\u201CWe\u2019ve been dedicated to infrastructure since Chainspace and that\u2019s all we\u2019ve done,\u201D said Messika, who also sits on the advisory board of his family\u2019s jewellery business, André Messika Diamonds. \u201CWe\u2019ve been able to attract the best founders in the world working on these problems.\u201D","Freedman Weissman has been brought in to help scale Eden Block, which is currently planning a second fund.","\u201COn a high level, it\u2019s to help institutionalize Eden Block,\u201D she said. Freedman Weissman added that this would mean corralling support from big backers for the next fund, and scaling the company from an operational standpoint.","Freedman Weissman said she sees the advent of web3 as a \u201Cseismic shift\u201D that affects all industries.&nbsp;\u201CSo being at the core, the infrastructure, is where I want to be,\u201D she added.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
