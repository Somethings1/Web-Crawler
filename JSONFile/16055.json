On the rise. Understood by few. Regional to mainly New York. Dismissed as a fad.","Pavel Bains is the CEO of Bluzelle. This article is part of Culture Week, which explores how crypto is changing media and entertainment.","Then, around 1990, it went national with Public Enemy, NWA, 2 Live Crew, Native Tongues Crew, countless others. It was embraced by the youth. Not just African Americans, but almost every minority in the U.S. and Canada, including my friends and I who were all first generation Indo-Canadians and Chinese-Canadians.","By 1992 hip hop style bled into sports and fashion. The Michigan \u201CFab Five\u201D repped every kid in high school at that time. They shaved their heads like Onyx, wore their shorts extra baggy, talked brash and wore black socks. They were so influential that Nike rushed out a line of black socks. Nike had only sold white socks then.","Our clothing style changed because of rappers. Snoop Dogg even made wearing hockey jerseys cool. Starter caps were a must. And then, when Allen Iverson entered the National Basketball Association in 1996, the league was changed forever.","Some people hated the style. It launched an era of \u201Crespectability politics,\u201D where pols and celebrities told kids to pull up their pants.","What was once considered a short-term trend \u2013 like a Tulip Bubble \u2013became a legitimate global culture. I\u2019ve travelled to almost every region of the world the past six years, and the one common culture is hip hop, even if you didn\u2019t realize it.","The biggest fashion designer in the world, Virgil Abloh, who recently passed away, was purely hip hop. He was also every kid I knew growing up.","Having paid witness to growth and longevity of hip hop culture, I now see something similar with crypto. NFTs have made the crossover, and they\u2019re never going away. It\u2019s now not just money but an integral part of their products and youth identity. Non-fungible tokens rep kids today like Georgetown Starter Caps and Satin Jackets repped me and mine.","Crypto has changed how communities form around products. Discord, or something like it, will be the main platform for any project or brand that wants to connect with the youth. Crypto is real-time, it\u2019s money, it\u2019s a video game, it\u2019s flexing, it\u2019s anti-establishment. Sense a trend?","Boomers are trying to jump in and take ownership of this trend. They\u2019re abusing the word \u201CWeb 3.\u201D It reminds me of when a 1990s family sitcom with sagging ratings would introduce a Black kid dressed like a rapper to try to save their dated show. There is a saying in rap, \u201CThere ain\u2019t no such thing as halfway crooks.\u201D We can see what they are doing from a mile away.","See also: Music NFTs Are Set for an Explosive 2022","I had an interview a few weeks back and they asked me, \u201CWhat are we going to say when a boomer googles \u2018NFT\u2019 and sees a bunch of crazy apes, frogs and wild stuff?\u201D","I said, \u201CWho gives a damn.\u201D What did the boomers of the 1990s say when they heard about rap on TV? When they saw Tupac giving the finger, Ice T yelling \u201Ccop killer\u201D and NWA saying \u201CF**k The Police.\u201D Boomers couldn\u2019t stop it then, and they won\u2019t stop a cultural movement now.","Crypto\u2018s ascendence into culture isn\u2019t even for us, it\u2019s for my teenage kid and her peers around the world. The difference is only a select group made the big money in hip hop. With crypto, we all can."],"entity":[{"type":"1992","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Georgetown Starter Caps","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bluzelle","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Public Enemy","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1990","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michigan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"National Basketball Association","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Native Tongues Crew","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1980s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1996","content":"DATE"},{"type":"1990s","content":"DATE"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Onyx","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Pavel Bains","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Allen Iverson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Virgil Abloh","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nike","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NWA","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Culture Week","Crypto 2022","NFTs","Music","Opinion"],"authors":["Pavel Bains"]}
