The move comes as bitcoin derivative markets outpace their ether-based equivalents.","\u201CAs Ethena scales closer towards $10bn this provides a more robust backing, and ultimately a safer product for users,\u201D the protocol said Thursday. USDe\u2019s current supply is worth roughly $2 billion, it added.","Ethena also pointed to bitcoin's superior liquidity and duration profile for delta hedging compared to liquid staking tokens as a factor in its decision to add bitcoin as a backing asset.","Until now, USDe has been backed exclusively by ether liquid staking tokens, Ethena Labs\u2019 website shows. Token holders are showing stronger interest in trading bitcoin, however.","Bitcoin open interest surged 150% to $25 billion in the past year, leading to a more than doubling of USDe's capacity to scale, Ethena said. Meanwhile, ether's open interest grew just 100% to $10 billion during the same period, according to data the protocol cited.","Bitcoin's comparatively strong demand comes amid a spectacular run-up in the virtual token's speculative value.
