NFTs that serve as user profiles allow users to interact with decentralized applications (dapps) within its ecosystem.&nbsp;","Now, any user can mint a Lens profile and access the protocol, whereas previously, profile creation was restricted to selected users.","This comes amid an increasingly competitive landscape of decentralized social media, where multiple platforms are vying for user engagement.
