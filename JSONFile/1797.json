The average reward was 600 OP tokens ($840), but it varied from user to user based on various criteria, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/optimismFND\/status\/1703837786703335672?ref=ethdaily.io\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to the team.","Optimism is a Layer 2 network built on top of the Ethereum network. It leverages optimistic-rollup technology to help scale decentralized applications.","The rewards were calculated based on the number of OP tokens delegated by a user multiplied by the duration for which they were held.","A minimum threshold (OP tokens delegated x days) was set at 18,000 units with an eligibility period of six months from January 20 to July 20. If a user delegated a minimum of 180 OP tokens over 100 days during this period, they would be eligible.&nbsp;","Optimism users who participated in at least one on-chain proposal (during the eligibility period) also received a 2x multiplier for their rewards. To ensure a fair distribution, rewards were capped at 10,000 OP tokens for each address.","The Optimism Collective\u2019s third airdrop to date came some days after the project <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/251351\/optimism-to-distribute-unclaimed-funds-from-first-airdrop\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">distributed<\/a> the remainder of the funds from its first airdrop (conducted in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/149464\/optimisms-governance-token-officially-goes-live\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">May 2022<\/a>) directly to the eligible addresses that had not yet claimed their rewards.","With the third round of airdrop concluded, a pool of about 570 million OP tokens is earmarked for future distributions.","Â© 2023 The Block.
