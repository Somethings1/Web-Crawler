Claiming that mining consumes excess grid capacity, it paints the picture of miners timing their operations to capitalize on near-free renewable energy generation peaks. Little incentive actually exists for private miners to do so.","For example, let\u2019s take an average spring day in California:","Notice that curtailment rates align most closely with spikes in solar power generation\u200A\u2014\u200Athis is a result of the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2018\/5\/9\/17336330\/duck-curve-solar-energy-supply-demand-problem-caiso-nrel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2018\/5\/9\/17336330\/duck-curve-solar-energy-supply-demand-problem-caiso-nrel\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">duck curve phenomenon<\/a> documented in solar-biased grids.

It would stand to reason that the marginal price for electricity during this period would dip due to oversupply. Within the context of Bitcoin mining, we\u2019d expect opportunistic miners to pile into the market until the rate of curtailment approaches 0%.","And yet, because energy markets depend on public infrastructure and utility monopolies, demand dictates consumer pricing more so than does supply. <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sce.com\/regulatory\/tariff-books\/rates-pricing-choices\/business-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.sce.com\/regulatory\/tariff-books\/rates-pricing-choices\/business-rates\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">California\u2019s<\/a> <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/San%20Diego%20Gas%20and%20Electric\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"http:\/\/San Diego Gas and Electric\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">five<\/a> <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/Pacific%20Gas%20and%20Electric\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"http:\/\/Pacific Gas and Electric\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">utilities<\/a> <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/Liberty%20Utilities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"http:\/\/Liberty Utilities\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">all<\/a> <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pacificpower.net\/ya\/po\/otou\/ooh.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.pacificpower.net\/ya\/po\/otou\/ooh.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">price<\/a> electricity with flat rates and tier systems that incentivize consumption outside of peak-demand times, most often in the dead of the night.

Its report\u2019s implication that miners have price incentives to align their operations with excess renewable generation incorrectly characterized Bitcoin mining as a marginal consumer of curtailed energy. As long as monopolistic, political grids remain the dominant option for industrial-scale mining, cryptocurrency analysts will have to suspend their free market assumptions when wading into issues surrounding the <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mitpressjournals.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1162\/INOV_a_00075\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.mitpressjournals.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1162\/INOV_a_00075\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">legacy<\/a> energy sector.","","CoinShares ends its report on a strong note with support for the stranded assets hypothesis originally proposed by Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures and Dan Held of Picks and Shovels. You can read an in-depth explanation in <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.picks.co\/pow-is-efficient-aa3d442754d3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https:\/\/blog.picks.co\/pow-is-efficient-aa3d442754d3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dan\u2019s post<\/a>. Its premise is sound: as long as mining rewards provide a marginal benefit greater than just curtailing a kWh of energy, Proof of Work presents an efficient use. With grid-scale storage solutions still a future fancy, Bitcoin mining will prove to be a niche solution to monetizing otherwise stranded energy assets.","","Suggesting that the liberated revenue streams offered by stranded energy assets would lead to an expansion of renewable generation, however, warrants criticism. The corollary represents an extrapolation of an otherwise sound conclusion; it ignores the relevant stakeholder priorities and risk tolerances that render the claim a nonstarter in practice. Consider the following:","Energy financiers, Bitcoin miners, and municipalities lack the common ground necessary for mutually-beneficial infrastructure development. The corollary put forward in the CoinShares report faces a dilemma, as it becomes difficult to match preferences on asset volatility and time horizon across all three stakeholder communities.<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Miners are effectively energy nomads<\/strong>, and the incentive structure simply isn\u2019t there to assume that they\u2019ll play a significant role in the expansion of new energy generation, let alone the renewable kind.","That should not distract from the fact that Bitcoin mining represents a clear value proposition for existing, underperforming energy assets. It\u2019s already occurring de facto with miners seeking out inefficient hydropower, and curtailment at the utility level represents the next logical step. The barrier to entry for a utility to contract a third-party ASIC operator only shrinks as mobile mining solutions mature and OTC crypto desks enter the mainstream.
