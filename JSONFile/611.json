The financing facility is custodied on Figure's distributed stakeholder blockchain Provenance.io.","\"With the financing facility now in place, Provenance.io can support the entire end-to-end financing of loans, from origination to funding to servicing to financing,\" said Cagney. \"It paves the way for the first securitization on-chain, which will demonstrate the massive cost savings, risk reduction and liquidity benefits blockchain delivers.\"","According to the press release, the three companies have been partners and have worked on structuring deal for over the past 6 months. Head of the Securitized Markets Group at Jefferies Brian McGrath said thanks to the use of Provenance, \u201CWe\u2019ve gained full transparency into the underlying assets, real-time access to loan performance and the process of accepting collateral has less friction than off chain.\u201D","WSFS Institutional Services, on the other hand, is a participating member of Provenance.
