The firm acquired the options exchange partially for the licenses it holds from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to launch a futures platform.","As for Blockchain.com, the acquisition of Altonomy\u2019s OTC business, which traded $16 billion last year, will help the firm expand its trading operation and presence in Asia, according to the source. Blockchain.com traded $10 billion last year across its OTC and other trading businesses. The core systems of Altonomy have been integrated into Blockchain.com\u2019s existing trading platform.","In Architect Partners\u2019 view, the deal will help Blockchain.com meet the needs of institutional clients who are keen to trade a more wide-range of coins.","\"Altonomy\u2019s expertise in altcoin and OTC trading will expand Blockchain.com\u2019s presence in this space, while also expanding their product suite,\" the firm said in a recent alert, adding:","Blockchain.com is not acquiring the entirety of Altonomy\u2019s business. Altonomy was founded by Ricky Li, who previously worked in the hedge fund world.","Looking to the future, Architect expects M&amp;A to continue to ramp up, driven by large exchanges.","\u201CGobbling small firms\u2014with over 400 active exchanges, there\u2019s plenty of ripe picking to acquire accounts by buying smaller firms,\u201D the firm noted."],"hashtag":[]}
