STEPN, which allows players to earn rewards for exercising through the purchase of sneaker NFTs, is currently based in Adelaide, Australia.","The company hasn't yet given a date for the move, but it comes as other financial and tech firms leave Hong Kong for fairer shores.","Among them, FTX <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/118663\/ftx-will-begin-to-move-key-operations-to-bahamas-as-part-of-hq-shift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">moved its headquarters<\/a> to The Bahamas last year. While the move was attributed to regulatory uncertainty, FTX CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried also tweeted his frustration at strict quarantine procedures.","\"Who would have thought two years ago that a significant consideration for where to live would be 'it's actually legal to enter and leave the country,'\" he said.","Former PwC global crypto leader Henri Arslanian also opted for the Cayman Islands and Dubai as the bases for his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/161412\/former-pwc-crypto-head-sets-up-crypto-asset-management-firm-in-dubai\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">new crypto asset management firm<\/a> over Hong Kong due to regulatory approval times and travel restrictions. That's despite saying he felt Hong Kong would have been its \"natural home.\"","Companies have expressed concern about the influence Beijing has over Hong Kong, particularly following the introduction of the National Security Law in June 2020. Beijing\u2019s antagonistic stance on non-government crypto projects is well known, and many crypto activities remain banned in Mainland China \u2014 albeit with plenty of people finding workarounds.","STEPN itself enjoyed a following in China until it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/149289\/stepn-to-block-mainland-china-users-in-compliance-with-regulators-scmp-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">turned off its GPS services<\/a> there in July, causing the app\u2019s token, GST, to drop 10% following the announcement. It is unclear to what extent STEPN's hand was forced by authorities.","Nevertheless, STEPN will join the remaining Hong Kong holdouts, including Animoca Brands, which is also based in Cyberport.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
