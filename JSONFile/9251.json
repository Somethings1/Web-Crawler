Last October, when the DEX raised $22 million in a Series B funding round, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/258378\/synfutures-dex-funding-token-plan\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> it was open to launching its token as part of its roadmap to decentralize the project.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SynFutures V3's launch on the Blast mainnet came right after the Layer 2 network's release. Blast, backed by high-profile investors including Paradigm, quickly gained popularity following its reveal, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/279293\/blast-tvl-mainnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">garnering<\/a> over $2.3 billion worth of total value locked, or TVL, before its mainnet even launched.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SynFutures first launched V3 on the Ethereum testnet in October. It had then planned to release the main protocol on several blockchains, including Polygon and zkSync Era, another competing Ethereum Layer 2 network, before committing to Blast, launching V3 on Blast's testnet in January. Lin now said the multichain expansion is still in the plans for V3, but the project hasn't decided which chains it will deploy on next. \"Our immediate focus is on driving adoption and volume on Blast,\" she said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SynFutures V2 is still live on the Polygon proof-of-stake chain, but the project has started phasing out support as it prioritizes the V3 rollout, Lin said, adding that V1, on the other hand, has been phased out. V1 and V2 processed over $23 billion in cumulative trading volume to date, Lin said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With its V3 launch, SynFutures plans to grow its platform with localized expansion, Lin said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, over 20 people are working for the Singapore-based firm. Lin plans to hire \"regional leads in business development and marketing in key markets\" and a few more people across research and product functions. It also looks to multichain expansion in the medium term, she added.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SynFutures has raised about $38 million in total funding and is backed by investors including Pantera Capital, HashKey Capital, and SIG DT Investments (a unit of the Susquehanna International Group).<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
