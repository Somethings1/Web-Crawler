The decision as to whether a Milestone is met is determined by an independent Advisory Board,\u201D the company wrote. \u201COn January 16th, that Advisory Board unanimously determined that Milestone 2 had been achieved, and on January 29th, we filed a Form 1-U with the SEC disclosing the achievement.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It was an announcement that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MessariCrypto\/status\/1222944025730256897\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">drew big plaudits<\/a> <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in some quarters; as Messari noted in its write-up of the announcement, the event presented \u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a notable milestone for any network, especially as numerous projects flood the market with new offerings and compete to win attention among an already thin user base.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But the announcement drew scrutiny as well (including, full disclosure, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lawmaster\/status\/1222993972714450946\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">from my colleagues<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> here at The Block), primarily centered around the question of whether those one million verified users represent actual human beings \u2013&nbsp;and how, exactly, Blockstack reached such a conclusion.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I reached out to Blockstack in an effort to learn more about the process behind the milestone determination. Here\u2019s what their representative initially sent me:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CVerification varies from app to app, and partner to partner, as they are independent. However, the Blockstack registration and authentication tool offers baked-in protection for spam registration, rate-limiting by IP, and more. Further, user acquisition campaigns by Blockstack PBC involved additional verification and\/or KYC processes. For example, through Blockchain.com, only 'Gold Level' users were added, a designation that requires that they have registered an address, government ID and more. At other times we've used the built-in browser social verification via Twitter, Facebook, Github, and other networks, and used phone number verification via Twilio step (restricted to trusted carriers and countries). All available information can be found in our blog post and the 1-U filing.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While my follow-up interview request was declined, I was sent a link to a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.blockstack.org\/user-activity-blockstack-network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">new blog post<\/a><\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;published on January 31st that could perhaps be construed as a response to questions I posed as well as the social media-based criticism directed toward Blockstack in the wake of the news. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As CEO Muneeb Ali wrote: \u201CThere have been some questions regarding username registrations vs. active users. In this post I will shed more light on the initial network growth and measurement limitations on the network.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For what it's worth, I believe that such questions are perfectly valid and ought to be pursued. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the nearly six years that I\u2019ve covered the industry, the perennial Moby-Dick hunt of the bitcoin and blockchain faithful has been the pursuit of adoption. From payment processors to custody solutions to financial products to user experiences to conferences to \u2013&nbsp;well, all of it \u2013 the general thrust has been to try and figure out ways by which the technology can be put in as many hands as possible, and to keep it there. And I would hazard a guess that some of the anxieties that exist in the space today share a common wellspring: the concern that adoption is slow and that this state of affairs may persist for the foreseeable future.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Blockstack announcement \u2013&nbsp;and the responses that followed \u2013 exist very much through that same lens. It\u2019s either a vitally important achievement because it\u2019s a strong indicator of adoption or it\u2019s just a bunch of nonsense and a grab at investor money because it\u2019s a poor indicator of adoption.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What is a \u201Cverified user\u201D, exactly? <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CVerified user\u201D <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1693656\/000119312520018075\/d878769d1u.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">was defined<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> by the advisory committee as a user account on the Blockstack network with at least one form of \u201Cacceptable attestation\u201D indicating that the user account is owned by a human and not owned and operated by a computer program or bot. \u201CAcceptable attestation,\u201D defined in the sole discretion of Blockstack, is either a KYC verification process, a phone number confirmation or a social media verification.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ali\u2019s follow-up post focused on \u201Cusername registrations\u201D versus the term \u201Cverified users\u201D as it existed in the original post, as well as the SEC filing that outlined the milestone. In fact, the term \u201Cverified user\u201D isn\u2019t mentioned at all in the January 31st post.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CPer our announcement, Blockstack PBC has on-boarded over 1 million registered usernames through a mix of collaborations, partnerships, marketing efforts, app growth driven by independent developers, and more. That being said, registered usernames are not the same as daily active users, nor have they ever been presented as such,\u201D he wrote. \u201CBack in 2017, when we were setting up the legal definition of users in the self-imposed milestone, we precisely defined a user as a registered username on the blockchain (not active user). The milestone was intended to introduce people to the Blockstack network. We\u2019ve achieved this goal through various channels. Blockstack PBC is not claiming to have a million active users on the Blockstack network.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In Blockstack\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1719379\/000141057818000410\/filename4.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SAFT document<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, governing the sales that took place in 2017 (as filed with the SEC), the firm said this: \u201C\u2018Verified User\u2019 shall mean a user account on the Network with at least one form of an \u2018Acceptable Attestation\u2019 indicating that the user account is owned by a human and not owned and operated by a computer program or bot.

As the startup said: \u201Cthe second milestone is for 1,000,000 verified users to be registered on the Blockstack network by the end of January 2020.\u201D&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It continued:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"As of the date of this offering circular, the network had approximately 115,780 registered user accounts. Of those 115,780 accounts, approximately 16,100 accounts had provided a \u201Csocial proof\u201D as evidence of having a human user, such as a GitHub link or Twitter message link. Of those 16,100 accounts, approximately 9,555 accounts had social proofs that could be verified with a link that was still working as of the date of this offering circular. These numbers are estimates, and the method of measuring the number of verified registered users for purposes of the second milestone is still under consideration by an independent advisory committee formed by the AI and QP Funds, the LP Advisory Committee.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to data, there were 156,600 total usernames <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20191106154345\/https:\/\/explorer.blockstack.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">by November 6<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">504,000 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/theblockstats.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">by December 8<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and 1.97 million addresses by January 29.

The number of total addresses grew by 344,000 since early November, which is also around the same time when the airdrop started. Moreover, none of the STX tokens airdropped by Blockchain.com will be delivered until February 2020\u200A \u2013 \u200Athey are all locked until then.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In a separate blog post, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.blockstack.org\/growth-in-a-decentralized-ecosystem\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blockstack disclosed<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that it was experimenting with airdropping STX tokens themselves and letting users verify their phone numbers through Twilio. That blog post highlighted exposure via privacy apps and messenger apps \u2013 both of which undoubtedly fit into the user profile of someone who would be attracted to a decentralized internet.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blockstack further noted that it \u201Cengaged in various marketing campaigns to raise awareness around internet privacy and educate people about decentralized applications. Our marketing campaigns targeted at university students were especially interesting; data collected from these campaigns suggests that university students may be an interesting initial community where decentralized apps and Blockstack ID use takes off.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>So, in sum, they undertook a range of efforts to identify and reach out to different kinds of users who might be drawn to the ethos and practical usage of a decentralized internet.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But all of this spurs on additional questioning.

Investor Arianna Simpson told me that \u201C[t]he measures for meeting Milestone 2 were decided in 2017 (should be in the SEC filing), and the advisory board determined that under these pre-set guidelines, Blockstack PBC met these requirements.\u201D But as Blockstack\u2019s July filing indicates, \u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the method of measuring the number of verified registered users for purposes of the second milestone is still under consideration by an independent advisory committee formed by the AI and QP Funds, the LP Advisory Committee.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Further \u2013 and these are, perhaps, more subjective queries \u2013 should the people who were airdropped STX tokens even be counted as verified users?

Why not set a milestone based on the number of registered users since day one?<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blockstack perhaps has an incentive to meet Milestone 2, as outlined in its <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reg A+ <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1693656\/000110465919039908\/a18-15736_1253g2.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">offering circular<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, in which it wrote:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIn the event Blockstack fails or is deemed to have failed to [reach one million verified users], Blockstack will be required to return a significant amount of capital that Blockstack currently intends to use in the development of the Blockstack network.
