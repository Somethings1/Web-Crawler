Another is that every artist, musician, and athlete will adopt non-fungible tokens (NFTs).","Through a recently launched <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjHufaz7sz2AhW1xzgGHd-MABoQFnoECAMQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theblockcrypto.com%2Fpost%2F125483%2Fmoonpay-concierge-celebrities-nft&amp;usg=AOvVaw0i7uAAgbHl7hao5cAvnldJ\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">concierge service<\/a> that helps celebrities and the super-rich buy NFTs, Soto-Wright has tried to position MoonPay as a catalyst for those trends.","The service \u2014 which counts Snoop Dogg, Diplo and Jimmy Fallon among glitzy group of clients \u2014 is part one of a plan to force NFTs into what Soto-Wright calls \u201Cthe cultural consciousness.\u201D","Now, Soto-Wright is kicking off phase two of that plan: charity.","Through <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/ivanhodl?embed%5b0%5d=%22acxzzzzzzzzbbbccccdddeeexca%22.replace%28%22z%22%2C%22o%22%29&amp;embed%5b1%5d=stryking\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a personal account<\/a> on NFT platform OpenSea named ivanhodl, Soto-Wright has amassed upwards of $1 million in digital art and collectibles \u2014 including pieces from coveted collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, World of Women and Clone X.","\u201CI have decided to dedicate all my NFTs and any profits from sales of my NFTs from ivanhodl to charitable causes,\u201D he says. \u201CThe idea is to broaden and diversify access to web3. It\u2019s about giving back, it\u2019s about focusing on efforts that do good in the world.\u201D","Soto-Wright appears to have amassed his personal collection in less than a year, having set up the ivanhodl wallet on OpenSea in June 2021. He has MoonPay \u2014 which at its core helps other companies\u2019 customers to buy and sell crypto \u2014 to thank for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;","\u201CI did have my own proceeds from MoonPay being profitable,\u201D he says. \u201CI was running the business and so I used that profitability to then invest in NFTs through ivanhodl.\u201D","It is not yet clear which causes Soto-Wright plans to donate his stash to. He says a range of causes will be selected, and listed museums, non-profits and charities as examples of potential partners.","The hope seems to be that through auctions and other such theater, the donation program will help to drum up wider interest in the NFT market. There is no specific timeframe in place. Instead, Soto-Wright described the initiative as \u201Ccontinuous.\u201D","\u201CI\u2019ve never really sold an NFT. I\u2019ve transferred or given away NFTs, but I\u2019ve never sold an NFT in my history. That\u2019s why I\u2019m ivanhodl \u2014 I\u2019m holding on for dear life,\u201D he adds. \u201CBut now we\u2019re holding on for dear life until we benefit non-profit causes.\u201D","MoonPay\u2019s concierge service has certainly helped bring considerable star power \u2014 and with it hype \u2014 to the NFT space. But some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2022\/2\/10\/22926057\/celebrity-nft-disclosure-marketing-reese-witherspoon-gwyneth-paltrow\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">have questioned<\/a> whether celebrities are in fact paying full whack for their digital goods, or simply promoting collections in exchange for a novel kind of payment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;","For his part, Soto-Wright has always maintained that clients of his concierge are invoiced for the full amount of any purchases \u2014 and that they pay up.","\u201CThere\u2019s no interrelationship with the collection. These people are coming to us independently and saying they want to buy something, and the concierge facilitates that,\u201D he says.","Either way, Soto-Wright's NFT dealing has seen him caught on camera schmoozing such music industry moguls as <a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/956A1B9F-5EFD-485A-A693-54FDA1310D38\/%E2%80%9CIt%20really%20has%20happened%20organically.%20One%20person%20finds%20out%20and%20basically%20they%20tell%20other%20people,%20and%20all%20of%20these%20people%20are%20friends,%20right?%20And%20that%E2%80%99s%20kind%20of%20what%E2%80%99s%20happened.%E2%80%9D%20%20%20%20%20And%20they%20all%20want%20to%20get%20up%20to%20speed%20on%20crypto%20and%20NFTs.%20And%20says%20MoonPay%20has%20become%20the%20go-to%20source%20for%20this.%20%20%20%20%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20been%20very%20much%20organic.%20A%20lot%20of%20these%20guys%20have%20become%20my%20friends.%E2%80%9D\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DJ Khaled<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/moonpay\/status\/1456671863640309760?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lil Baby<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kygo_charts\/status\/1452601823492288512?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kygo<\/a>.

A lot of these guys have become my friends,\u201D he says.","Soto-Wright concedes that some celebrities have managers or trustees who look after their crypto wallets and private keys for them. But the crucial thing, in his view, is that the NFTs they buy hold value linked to a blockchain.","\u201CThat wallet is the foundational infrastructure and building block for all value to eventually move over blockchains,\u201D says Soto-Wright."],"hashtag":[]}
