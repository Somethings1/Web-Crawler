Sentinel Insurance Company Ltd., Cal. Superior Court, Los Angeles County, 18STSVO7218 (12\/5\/2018) [SDP]<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/strong><\/em>","Insurance is only boring until you have to make a claim (or like this author are an insurance coverage lawyer). This new lawsuit involves an insurance coverage dispute involving a mining hardware loss. It was filed in state court in California, removed to federal court and just remanded to state court. I\u2019m not going to talk about the removal and remand process because it\u2019s not as interesting as the insurance component of this case.&nbsp;","Plaintiffs allege that \u201Cprior to September 2017, [their] business model was to design and build high-powered computers that \u2018mine\u2019 cryptocurrency full time\u201D and depended on their ability to provide a warranty, only offered after three months of continuous operation.","In September 2017, they say that 16 mining rigs were stolen and several dozen were \u201Ctotal losses\u201D because of damage they suffered in the break-in. They further allege that \u201Cat the time of the burglary, Plaintiff had purchased the component parts for their machines on credit, with the intent of repaying those loans once the machines were sold. At the time of the burglary, the global cryptocurrency market was very favorable, and demand for the \u201Crigs\u201D was very high. However, as a result of the burglary, Plaintiff was left without any means of repaying its loans, as the Subject Property had been stolen and\/or irreparably damaged. Absent a payment of insurance benefits, Plaintiff would be unable to continue operating its business.\u201D","Plaintiffs allege that the insurance company gave them a long run around, made unreasonable and confusing inspection and testing results, \u201Cfailed to take into consideration all the information and evidence\u201D and ultimately \u201Cissued a claim denial\u201D (though confusingly the Complaint also says that some money was paid). The lawsuit names both the insurance company, one of its insurance adjusters and 20 John Does as defendants. It sues for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair business practice under California law, and negligent misrepresentation (guffaw). It also asks for punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees.","While I\u2019ve seen all manner of insurance company hijinks, it\u2019s actually a little hard to figure out from this Complaint what the insurance company did wrong. It also seems to proceed from the see-what-sticks theory of litigation\u200A\u2014\u200Aif you throw enough up on the wall, something will stick. I suspect that the biggest part of the dispute centers around business interruption coverage, which is a part of certain types property policies that will pay for costs associated with business stopping because of an insured loss. Another problem might be valuation of the assets themselves in a really volatile market. But it\u2019s hard to know, because the complaint makes some loud claims but not quite as much on-point detail.","Also, I strongly suspect that the only claim that survives motion practice is the breach of contract claim, and that the adjuster and the John Doe defendants will be dismissed. (A little bit of a rant here\u200A\u2014\u200AI don\u2019t understand why plaintiff\u2019s lawyers make allegations that are almost certain to trigger motion practice that they stand a good chance of losing. I don\u2019t represent insurance companies, I am only ever averse to them, but it still makes no sense to me when I see a complaint larded with this kind of chazerai.","I\u2019m honestly a little bit disappointed that there aren\u2019t more details about the underlying insurance dispute here, because we could use a little more precedent in this space. For now, I just hope these plaintiffs\u200A\u2014\u200Awho say the theft and subsequent insurance coverage fight destroyed their business\u200A\u2014\u200Aaren\u2019t paying on a contingent fee basis. In the meantime, if more happens on this case, I\u2019ll be sure to cover it here.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
