With bitcoin trading back at yearly highs, the inclination to short-sell has decreased, while the willingness to go long has increased, according to the analysts. This change is evidenced by the longest streak of neutral funding rates over the past week since early February. Although there's been a slight increase in open interest, leveraged exposure to bitcoin remains modest, suggesting a moderate to low risk of liquidation squeezes in the near term, they added.","Options traders are also maintaining a bullish stance, aligning with the broader derivatives sentiment, according to the K33 Research analysts. The increase in implied volatility after the recent price movements indicates that volatility strategies in options trading have become more costly, they added. Though, the options open interest uptrend throughout 2023 compared to declines in other derivatives markets highlights their increasing role in bitcoin's price discovery, Lunde and Helseth argued.","Despite these developments in the derivatives market, there's no strong indication of a consistent increase in spot volumes. The market continues to react dynamically to price movements, with volumes spiking during active trading periods and then settling back, the analysts said.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/total-exchange-volume-daily\/embed\" title=\"Daily Exchange Volume (7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
