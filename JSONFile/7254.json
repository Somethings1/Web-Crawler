The Department says it's investigating whether providers are violating jurisdictional laws.","The notice encourages California customers of platforms that have slowed or paused withdrawals or transfers of crypto assets to contact the department. Though the notice doesn't name any firms as part of the investigation, crypto lender <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/156805\/celsius-hires-new-restructuring-lawyers-to-help-navigate-its-options-wsj\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Celsius<\/a> has yet to restart withdrawals and transactions on its platform since pausing the services last month during a liquidity crisis.

The purpose of registration, according to the DFPI, is to make adequate disclosures to investors. Now, it's looking into whether other firms may be on the hook for the same violations.","\"The Department warns California consumers and investors that many crypto-interest account providers may not have adequately disclosed risks customers face when they deposit crypto assets onto these platforms,\" said the notice. \"Crypto-interest account providers are not governed by the same rules and protections as banks and credit unions, which are required to have deposit insurance.\"","© 2023 The Block.
