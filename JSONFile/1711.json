It also includes $1 billion that was removed from the stablecoin's supply on Tron network in one day, earlier in October.","Circle burns USDC when a user redeems the coin for the underlying fiat currency, usually US dollars, that backs the stablecoin. The company does this by sending the redeemed tokens to the burn address, permanently deleting those coins from the blockchain record.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/stablecoins\/total-stablecoin-supply-daily\/embed\" title=\"Total Stablecoin Supply\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","This spike in USDC burn has coincided with a marked decline in the yield offered by major DeFi platforms to stablecoin lenders.
