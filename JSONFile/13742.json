Its social media accounts on platforms such as Twitter and Telegram have been deleted, and the official website is currently unreachable.","The exit scam came to light after <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/zachxbt\/status\/1694914871165345997?t=Cb9W5zUPYIvAsQcpk0rfog&amp;s=19\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a warning by on-chain analyst ZachXBT<\/a> earlier today. The sleuth had cautioned that Magnate Finance on Base could likely carry out an exit scam. They arrived at this conclusion after discovering that Magnate Finance's deployer address was directly linked to a previous exit scam involving a project called Solfire, where $4.8 million was defrauded.","August has been a troubling month for Base. This incident marks the second rug pull seen this month.
