Some 23 fraud incidents resulted in losses worth nearly $7.5 million, according to Immunefi.","BNB Chain and Ethereum remained the most targeted chains in November, suffering the majority of the total losses at a combined 83%.&nbsp;","BNB Chain suffered the most individual attacks, with 22 incidents \u2014 representing 53.7% of the losses.
