During a background press briefing on Thursday, Biden administration officials told journalists that none of the reports published Friday included recommendations for congressional action. But it was not clear if FSOC's new report would also steer clear of asking Congress to pass new laws.","When asked to clarify if the still-pending FSOC report would include legislative proposals, a Treasury spokesperson declined to comment.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
