Maple Direct will focus on offering bespoke, or project-tailored, deals to web3 native entities with outside capital from Institutional Allocators. The first lending product is set to begin in July, and the company mandates all of its lenders to pass know-your-customer checks, the company said in a statement.","\"Maple Direct is the first Web3 lending business since the fall of CeFi lenders such as BlockFi and Genesis,\" the company said in a statement. \"These platforms had lent $55 billion but have since exited the space, leaving Web3 businesses without a reliable debt capital source.\"","Traditional debt-capital providers don't have the necessary focus or expertise to underwrite the sector, the company added.&nbsp;","\"Maple is launching this new business division to directly address the lack of direct lending offerings in the crypto market,\" Maple Finance CEO Sid Powell told The Block. \"Web3 businesses, which are touted to contribute trillions to the global economy, currently don\u2019t have a reliable debt capital source.
