Wiley is also a member of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on digital assets, financial technology and inclusion.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The GAO decision is just the latest in a series of losses for the SEC demonstrating the agency's disregard for the statutorily required processes in the Administrative Procedures Act,\" Wiley said.

Patrick T. McHenry, R-N.C., who chairs the House Financial Services Committee said the bulletin would \"impose massive new requirements on financial institutions.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Ultimately, this would deter institutions and firms from offering custodial services \u2014 denying Americans access to safe and secure custody of their assets,\" McHenry said in a statement. \"SAB 121 was drafted with zero input from prudential regulators and the public, and now Congress must step in to block this harmful rule.\u201D<\/span>","<span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sen.
