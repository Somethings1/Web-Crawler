Still, many remain unconvinced.","Bankman-Fried acknowledged the importance of comments made by the wider DeFi community before noting that the \"core goal\" of the DCCPA bill is to answer: \"How can a regulated centralized entity interface with DeFi?\"","\"In particular, it is *not* making claims about what DeFi devs, smart contracts, and validators must do,\" Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SBF_FTX\/status\/1584095473031602176\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a>. \"It\u2019s looking to eventually establish guidelines about how e.g. FTX\u2019s platform--or Fidelity's--could interface with DeFi contracts.\" The FTX CEO also noted that he'd only support a version clarifying that developers and validators are not (and shouldn't be regulated as) platforms.","The intersection of centralized entities with DeFi, in particular, was highlighted as a sticking point by pseudonymous&nbsp;ApeWorX Ltd. builder \"señor doggo,\" who <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fubuloubu\/status\/1584178585090211840\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> that \"it should *never* be the case that there is a mandate to access DeFi through a centralized intermediary's interface,\" further noting that: \"Devs should be allowed to build whatever interfaces they want.\"","The fear exists that DCCPA won't allow developers to build whatever interfaces they want \u2014 at least, not without centralized entities grabbing a piece of the pie. CEHV partner Adam Cochran <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adamscochran\/status\/1584185331964080128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;\"the revised version still reads at how can there be a moat that lets centralized entities control at least part of the flow into DeFi, so they can profit from it.\"","The desire for regulation-driven profit is something with which some crypto proponents are taking major issue \u2014 especially because Bankman-Fried's industry endeavors have been extremely profitable. \"I\u2019m all for people hustling hard and winning,\" 1492.eth <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NTmoney\/status\/1584155335090020354\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> to their 50.3k followers. \"FTX\/Alameda has clearly hustled hard and is winning big[.] The issue is making money by fleecing retail and then trying to pose as the savior for crypto regulation and consumer protection in the U.S.\"","Meanwhile, some argue that anyone working with regulators to benefit the crypto industry isn't <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">actually<\/em> doing so to benefit the crypto industry. \"The people 'saving crypto' aren\u2019t even the lobbyists,\" <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/prestonjbyrne\/status\/1584165298277867520\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> <span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 css-1hf3ou5 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Preston Byrne, partner at Brown Rudnick. \"<\/span><\/span>They\u2019re mostly the devs who are making it harder to ban, harder to stop, and more useful for end users.
