Users that stake ether (ETH) on the platform generate a yield and automatically receive ezETH, Renzo\u2019s liquid restaking token, which can be used to generate a higher yield across various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.","Users holding more than 500,000 ezPoints, which were accumulated by staking on Renzo following its launch in January, are subject to a 50% lockup over a three-month vesting period.","Renzo said in a tweet that REZ was not available to trade on any decentralized exchange, although the official token contract posted on Renzo\u2019s website had racked up $75 million in trading volume an hour after claims went live, Dextools data shows.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"$75 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$289 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"32%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"8.85 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"31%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"1.15 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinMarketCap","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Restaking","airdrop"],"authors":["Oliver Knight"]}
