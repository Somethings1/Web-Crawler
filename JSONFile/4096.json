It offers a native decentralized stablecoin called Acala USD (aUSD) that can be minted using collateral tokens \u2014 including polkadot (DOT), kusama (KSM), acala (ACA) and karura (KAR) \u2014 and then be staked for yield.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On 13 August, Acala suffered a security exploit as a result of a code misconfiguration in a smart contract that controlled a&nbsp; liquidity pool. The misconfiguration led liquidity providers (LPs) to \u201Cerror mint\u201D nearly 3 billion of aUSD when they withdrew their assets. The LPs then repeatedly added more liquidity to receive more aUSD in a loop.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In total, about 300 addresses had illegitimately taken out 3.02 billion aUSD in their wallets. Only a a small portion was transferred out to other parachains.
