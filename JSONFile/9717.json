Coinbase dropped 9.9% to about $52, MicroStrategy fell 9.3% to $191.40, and Block dropped 4.1% to just below $71.&nbsp;","Macroeconomic conditions have weighed heavily on markets this week.

The sting was taken out by wage growth coming in below expectations and the jobless rate increasing by 0.2%, Trakx's Ryan Shea, a crypto economist, told The Block.&nbsp;","\"Overall, it was a bit of a \"something for everyone\" report, with the hawks being able to point to strong employment and the doves to the uptick in the jobless rate and easing wage growth,\" he said. Today's report is unlikely to provide much clarity, Shea said, noting that attention will shift to next Tuesday's inflation U.S. data.&nbsp;","\"That said, given the surfacing of worries about the health of some parts of the U.S. TradFi banking sector, the macro news could easily become overshadowed by market events,\" he said.","Following the latest setback for the crypto ecosystem, JPMorgan analysts remain negative on the space. Silvergate Bank, the bank of choice for many crypto firms in the U.S., is set to wind down, and this could leave firms scrambling to find suitable banking partners.&nbsp;","\"The negative news from Silvergate\u2019s collapse dented crypto investors\u2019 sentiment with our crypto positioning indicators based on CME bitcoin and ethereum futures shifting to the very oversold levels of the end of last year, effectively reversing the previous positive year-to-date impulse,\" analysts at the bank wrote in a note.","\"Looking at the shape of the futures curve, the reversal in the bitcoin and ethereum futures spread over spot is also indicative of a deterioration in demand,\" they said.","The \"size of the stablecoin universe and the pace of crypto VC funding\" must improve before this outlook changes, the analysts said.&nbsp;","Banking woes worsened today as Silicon Valley Bank was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/218838\/silicon-valley-bank-closed-by-california-regulator\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">closed<\/a> by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.
