LVR refers to the losses liquidity providers on an AMM-based decentralized exchange incur due to arbitrage bots constantly rebalancing liquidity pools.","The AMM would capture the MEV that would otherwise be lost to arbitrageurs \u2014 or MEV bots \u2014 and share it back with LPs, the developers explained. \u201CLiquidity providers are protected from toxic flow and know that whoever rebalances will always forward them surplus,\u201D a spokesperson for CoW DAO said.","An automated market maker is a decentralized exchange that facilitates trading between crypto tokens. Instead of relying on traditional order books where buyers and sellers directly match orders, AMMs use liquidity pools to automate the pricing and trading.&nbsp;","The project's flagship offering until now is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/261547\/dex-aggregator-cow-swaps-core-team-has-proposed-adding-fees-in-six-month-test\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoW Swap<\/a> \u2014 an intent-based decentralized exchange aggregator. Its AMM release will complement the aggregator, allowing existing users to tap into better liquidity.","While CoW DAO\u2019s other products already secure traders from MEV, CoW AMM is the first product from the project protecting liquidity providers.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
