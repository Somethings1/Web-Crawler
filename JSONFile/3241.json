If successful, the sale would generate proceeds of $187.5 million, valuing the project at $2.5 billion.","Two people familiar with the matter confirmed that Wormhole is attempting a token sale at that valuation, and that the raise is yet to close. A spokesperson for Wormhole declined to comment.","The documents obtained by The Block, dated February 18, appear to have begun circulating among potential investors just weeks after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/132909\/wormhole-replenishes-its-blockchain-bridge-after-325-million-exploit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a $325 million exploit<\/a> \u2014 ranking among the largest crypto heists ever \u2014 that saw 120,000 ether drained from the Wormhole protocol.

Developers rolled out a second version of the protocol in August 2021 that supported seven different blockchains \u2014 including Solana, Terra, Avalanche, Ethereum, Oasis, Binance and Polygon.
