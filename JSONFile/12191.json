He suggested three ways of achieving this \u2014 such as limiting leverage on DeFi protocol front-end websites, requiring transparency about what audits have been done and restricting access to tools through the use of knowledge tests.","Buterin added that he would like to see zero-knowledge technology being used to meet requirements like these. This technology allows for something to be mathematically proven without necessarily giving away the information behind it.","He also criticized some other potential ways of regulating DeFi protocols. He said that putting know-your-customer requirements on DeFi front ends would only annoy users and not frustrate hackers. This is because bad actors interact directly with the protocols and don\u2019t need to access them via the front ends. He added that centralized exchanges are a much better place for this type of regulation.","The Ethereum co-founder claimed that the crypto industry needs more time to mature before it\u2019s ready for mainstream adoption, which would come with more stringent regulations.","Buterin&nbsp;added he was happy that a lot of the exchange traded funds are getting delayed \u2014 giving more time for the crypto industry to develop and improve.&nbsp;","\u201CBasically, especially at this time, regulation that leaves the crypto space free to act internally but makes it harder for crypto projects to reach the mainstream is much less bad than regulation that intrudes on how crypto works internally,\u201D he said.","Buterin\u2019s comments come on the back of widespread debate within the crypto community on how it should be regulated.
