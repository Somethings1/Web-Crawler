Upon approval, this merger may see the integration of the lending logic and algorithms of the UX Chain with Osmosis' DEX and create a comprehensive DeFi hub.&nbsp;","This proposal, a collaborative effort by contributors from both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239121\/cosmos-osmosis-concentrated-liquidity\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Osmosis<\/a> and UX Chain, detailed a <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.osmosis.zone\/t\/merger-between-osmosis-and-umee\/780\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">strategic plan<\/a> for the proposed merger. The process will unfold in steps, beginning with integrating the UX Chain\u2019s codebase onto the Osmosis Chain. This integration aims to amalgamate the capabilities of both platforms. Anticipated outcomes of this initial step include blending shared total value locked across the two networks. At this initial step, both chains will have their respective tokens \u2014 the Osmosis token and the UX token \u2014 continue to trade distinctly.&nbsp;","Subsequently, there will be the possibility of a step related to combining the two tokens, including a potential token swap or migration. According to the proposal, this step would lead to creating a unified token that represents both networks. The token swap configurations will be decided based on community governance.","\"Each chain will have a separate governance vote from each blockchain network. The community governance will manage the processes separately for each network toward achieving consensus around the end goal of creating the DeFi hub,\" Brent Xu, co-founder of UX Chain told The Block in a statement.","This proposed merger is also aimed at enabling UX Chain to add value to Osmosis\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231317\/osmosis-axelar-and-akash-fund-mesh-security-model-for-cosmos-ecosystem\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mesh security<\/a> \u2014 the capacity of the network to secure other blockchain projects \u2014 by potentially leveraging the combined expertise or merging validator sets of both networks. Leveraging each other, UX Chain and Osmosis may explore the potential for developing advanced liquidations, native margin trading and MEV markets.","\u201CThis proposal to merge the Umee UX DeFi experience into the Osmosis chain would enable some really powerful new features and functionalities for our users \u2014 and we\u2019re excited to continue our collaboration with UX Chain with what the community decides is best,\u201D Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal said.","The development teams behind both projects have previously secured significant funding. UX Chain <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/128813\/defi-startup-umee-raises-additional-32-million-in-coinlist-sale\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised $32 million<\/a> through a CoinList coin offering in 2021, preceded by a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/108442\/umee-raises-6-3-million-to-fuel-push-to-become-cross-chain-hub-for-defi-tools\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$6.3 million seed<\/a> round led by Polychain Capital.
