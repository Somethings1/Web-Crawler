That report urged Congress to create \"rules of the road\" for stablecoin issuers, mainly by restricting stablecoin issuance to insured depository institutions (IDIs).&nbsp;","The Treasury has already designated stablecoins a \"systemic risk\" for the Financial Stability Oversight Council, meaning that if Congress fails to act, the council can step in.
