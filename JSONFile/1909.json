Wednesday, it shot up to 1.5 billion, and today it has increased as high as 25.3 billion \u2014 and it's still growing at a furious rate.","As The Block previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/146532\/billions-of-luna-minted-as-supply-grows-20-fold-in-four-days\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">broke down<\/a>, a behavioral cycle is affecting the two tokens in light of UST losing its peg and a huge amount of selling pressure.
