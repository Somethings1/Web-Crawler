According to the Ethereum Foundation, the proof-of-stake transition resulted in a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/claims\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">99.9% decline<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in energy consumption, which is expected to dramatically reduce the blockchain\u2019s carbon footprint.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In line with Buterin\u2019s expectations, the teams behind Zcash and Dogecoin have already expressed interest in moving to proof of stake in separate announcements. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In mid-2021, Electric Coin Company, the development firm behind Zcash, wrote a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/electriccoin.co\/blog\/proof-of-stake-research-overview-1\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blog post<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> detailing its approach and next steps toward implementing PoS.
