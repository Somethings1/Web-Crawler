Gibbs said mining machines will start coming online by the end of January 2022 and reach the planned capacity by the end of that year.","When at total capacity, the new facility is expected to contribute more than 3 EH\/s (exahashes per second) of hash rate to the Bitcoin network, according to Gibbs. Currently, Compass customers contribute about 760 PH\/s (petahashes per second), which is about 0.5% of the current Bitcoin hash rate, said Gibbs.","As for Red Jar Digital Infrastructure's role in the partnership, Gibbs said the firm leases the facility and holds the power purchase agreement. \"They have selected Compass to fill and co-manage the site\/ ASICs,\" he said.","\"Our deep knowledge and experience in managing complex electrical projects and understanding of the intricacies of tariff structures across Canada complements Compass Mining's expertise in ASIC sourcing and hosting,\" said Ron Dizy, CEO of Red Jar Digital Infrastructure.","Dizy went on to say that this is the first bitcoin mining facility Red Jar is building and that the firm is looking forward to developing additional sites in the future in Canada.","Â© 2023 The Block.
