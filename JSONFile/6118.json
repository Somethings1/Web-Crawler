However, the initiative has deployed less than $30 million so far, Bloomberg <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-10-10\/binance-s-1-billion-plan-to-save-crypto-after-ftx-has-quietly-fizzled-out\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a>.","Binance allocated approximately $1 billion in its BUSD stablecoin to the initiative itself, and other crypto firms, including Jump Crypto, DWF Labs, Animoca Brands, Aptos Labs, GSR, Kronos Research, Booker Group and Polygon Labs, added a further $70 million. However, only one out of nine publicly named participants, Aptos Labs, fully invested their pledged funds, Bloomberg noted. Binance said 18 companies participated in total.","In a November interview with Bloomberg, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao pitched the recovery fund as a transparent initiative. However, while a Binance spokesperson told Bloomberg the IRI had financed 14 projects, it declined to name them or how much they received.","Binance moved $985 million of the funds it committed to the initiative back to its corporate treasury for other investments, the spokesperson added.","Binance's sole public investment was a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233446\/south-korean-regulator-delays-gopax-acquisition-due-to-binance-sec-lawsuit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$15 million stake<\/a> in the South Korean crypto exchange GOPAX.
