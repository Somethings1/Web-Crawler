In a written statement, he said the Pulsar acquisition gives the company an immediate boost, allowing it to quickly bring cross-chain apps to market. \u201CIntegrating Pulsar not only enriches our technology stack but also adds an incredibly talented team led by three innovative entrepreneurs with a proven track record of success building and launching successful applications,\u201D he said.","Set up in 2021, Pulsar\u2019s analytics platform today supports 96 networks and more than 700 protocols, according to today\u2019s announcement. The startup offers users an easy way to track performance across a range of tokens, DeFi positions and NFTs.","Its flagship product, named Portfolio, will be integrated into Terraform\u2019s Station, a cross-chain wallet. Pulsar\u2019s Data product will be merged with Terraform\u2019s infrastructure tools.","\u201CTerraform Labs never stopped building, but we needed to take some time after Do\u2019s departure to adapt our strategy,\u201D Amani said. \u201CThe core principle behind TFL has always been utility. We are now focusing on applying that principle to the development of a blockchain ecosystem.\u201D","Terms of the deal were not disclosed.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
