One part of the plan involves setting up a presence in the Caribbean.","Huobi was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-08-12\/china-crypto-mogul-seeks-to-sell-huobi-stake-at-3-billion-value\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acquired<\/a> by About Capital Management\u2019s M&amp;A fund on Oct. 7. Financial terms were not disclosed, but earlier reports <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-08-12\/china-crypto-mogul-seeks-to-sell-huobi-stake-at-3-billion-value\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suggested<\/a> that founder Leon Li \u2014 who set up Huobi in 2013 in China \u2014 had been looking to offload his stake in a deal that would value the business at $3 billion. Days later, Sun was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huobi.com\/support\/zh-cn\/detail\/34919663373190\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">named<\/a> an advisor to Huobi. Speculation abounded that he was, in fact, the true buyer behind the About Capital deal, but Sun <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175867\/justin-sun-denies-being-real-buyer-of-huobi-stake-sale-exclusive\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">denied<\/a> those claims in an email correspondence with The Block.","Asked why Sun, in his role as advisor, appears now to be playing so central a role at Huobi, a spokesperson for the company said, \u201Che\u2019s lending his fair share of experience in marketing to ensure that Huobi\u2019s rebranding launch will be successful.\" They added: \"Justin\u2019s entire experience of building Tron\u2019s brand from zero to one was invaluable.\u201D","Sun <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-10-14\/crypto-s-justin-sun-says-he-owns-tens-of-millions-huobi-tokens\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told<\/a> Bloomberg in October that he owns \u201Ctens of millions\u201D of HT, Huobi\u2019s native token. Shortly after the Huobi sale, Sun <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/justinsuntron\/status\/1579406526040899584\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> in a tweet that \u201Cthe key to revitalizing Huobi is to empower HT, and HT can only thrive on Huobi.\u201D Its price briefly spiked after that, before crashing back down to around $5 this month, according to CoinGecko data.&nbsp;","In its announcement today, Huobi said it wants to \u201Cgive full play to the important strategic attributes of HT.\"","Huobi\u2019s spokesperson added: \u201CThere are plans to enable HT holders to vote to decide which tokens get listed on the exchange, such as the launch of PrimeVote earlier this month. It is one of Huobi\u2019s initiatives to empower HT holders, as it gives voting rights back to the community so that users can have a say in the decisions that impact them the most.\u201D","A rebrand will see the company's name change from Huobi Global to simply Huobi \u2014 a nod, based on the characters that make up the Chinese version of the name, to its ambitions to once again become one of the world\u2019s top three crypto exchanges.","Other points of focus in the plan outlined by Huobi involve international expansion and investments. The company plans to establish a presence in the Caribbean region \u2014 which it described in its announcement as an emerging crypto hub. Last year, Sun took a new post as ambassador to the World Trade Organization for the Caribbean island nation of Grenada. He has since been styled in announcements as \u201CHis Excellency.\u201D","The Bahamas has&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6i18EBpcfR8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">found<\/a> itself embroiled in the shocking collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire in recent weeks, but Huobi\u2019s spokesperson said the FTX saga would not damage the wider Caribbean region\u2019s attractiveness as a base for crypto outfits.&nbsp;\u201CFTX was catastrophically mismanaged as a company but that does not equate to anything wrong with the Caribbeans per se,\u201D they said. \u201CThe Caribbeans remain an attractive region for Huobi to expand since there is a strong incentive to build a more decentralized digital financial infrastructure.\u201D","On the investment front, Huobi said it will ramp up investments in Southeast Asia, Europe and other regions in which it could acquire new users. Strategic mergers and acquisitions are also on the table, it added.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/spot\/crypto-only-exchange-market-share\/embed\" title=\"Crypto-only Exchange Market Share\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Â© 2023 The Block.
