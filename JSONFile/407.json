Recommendations include distinguishing between different types of crypto for bespoke regulation, coordinating between the crypto industry and the public sector, and the educating of lawmakers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe appreciate that the UK may not be the first mover in all of these and we think there's an advantage to that,\u201D Friedman said. \u201CThere is value in seeing how different frameworks unfold and adopting best practices.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The regulatory paper is published in the midst of a downward spiral for the crypto industry following the shocking meltdown of the second-largest exchange, FTX. Leaked reports that came out earlier in November about the mishandling of the exchange\u2019s funds led to a domino of events that have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186520\/pissed-pessimistic-and-paranoid-ftx-clients-panic-money-likely-gone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">left<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> millions of users devoid of their funds.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For Friedman, this underscores the urgency to push for regulation. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhen you look at the past week, what we've seen is that absent a regulatory framework, what happens is providers will drive liquidity offshore,\u201D she said, referring to the FTX headquarters in the Bahamas while it provided its services globally. \u201CThere is no separate mechanism for UK authorities like the Financial Conduct Authority to provide protections for consumers.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Financial Markets and Services Bill is currently the main vessel for a comprehensive legislative framework for crypto in the UK, after amendments to include crypto in its scope <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/179906\/uk-lawmakers-voted-to-include-crypto-rules-in-finance-regulation-bill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">passed<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> a parliamentary vote in October.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Andrew Whitworth, Ripple\u2019s policy director, hopes that Ripple\u2019s guidance will make its way to the rule-writing process that the FCA will be mandated if the bill passes. Once the bill goes through the hands of policymakers, UK regulators will then have the chance to iron out the actionable components of the new laws.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe FCA has the power to then go through and actually create the details of the provision,\" <\/span>Whitworth said in the same interview with The Block. \"It should work since it is the <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">same bill which creates an institutional framework and also includes crypto assets within the financial regulatory space.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple\u2019s main recommendation is to bring a comprehensive legal framework into force, which assesses crypto assets according to distinct risk profiles.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere are different business models, different technologies, different blockchains. We're not talking about one single thing called crypto, which should be regulated,\u201D said Whitworth. A crypto regulatory framework should \u201Crecognize the different risk profiles and provide them with different regulatory treatments,\u201D he added. \u201CIt's something the regulators know already about the traditional regulatory frameworks, but often when the policy discussion around crypto happens, that distinction gets forgotten.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple has been battling a lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which in 2020 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/88912\/sec-ripple-labs-lawsuit-filed-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> against CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, citing a $1.3 billion unregistered securities sale.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt goes to the core question of how different crypto should be treated,\u201D Friedman said. \u201CThere is no question that XRP is not a security in the UK. Rather, the FCA has described XRP as a hybrid exchange utility token.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere needs to be some coherence globally,\u201D Friedman added, \u201Cso that you're not creating walled garden so that the company operating in the UK can operate and the U.S. can operate in Singapore.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple is currently in the process of filing a reply brief to summary judgment, according to Friedman.
