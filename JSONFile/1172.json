The first $50 million investment comes from none other than bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer. Bitdeer chairman Jihan Wu is seeking to raise an additional $200 million from outside investors.","\"The fund size is 250M and the returns will depend on the hashrate price when the market recovers in the next bull run,\" said Matt Linghui Kong, the CEO of Bitdeer Group. \"Interest is expected from institutions that are open to opportunities in mining and riding the market cycle, but don't have direct access or operational expertise, for e.g. alternative investment funds, family offices and venture capital.\"","Icebreaker's Jones referred to miners that can still manage to generate enough cash flow in a market with suppressed bitcoin pricing and elevated hash rates. Production costs \u2014 energy in particular \u2014 stick out as an important factor and miners with long-term power contracts at a fixed rate can offer more security for the term of the loan.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/bitcoins-hash-rate-daily\/embed\" title=\"Bitcoin's Hash Rate (EH\/s, 7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","\"The market's fundamentally changed,\" Jones said. \"If I go back six months ago, there were a lot of lenders in the space. Market pricing was I think extremely aggressive (...) Not really reflecting the risks being embodied.\"","The rates that Icebreaker Finance is now offering (15% to 20%, with 12 to 18 months maturity) are on the higher end at least compared to other loans seen this year from public miners \u2014 for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/139638\/bitcoin-miner-iris-energy-secures-71-million-in-equipment-financing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Iris Energy in March<\/a> (11% interest rate from NYDIG), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/145064\/argo-secures-up-to-70-6-million-in-loans-for-texas-mining-facility\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Argo Blockchain in May<\/a> (12% from NYDIG), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/153294\/bitfarms-gives-up-3000-btc-to-pay-down-100-million-loan-from-galaxy-digital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitfarms in June<\/a> (12% from Galaxy Digital), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/160884\/bitcoin-miner-marathon-secures-additional-100-million-loan\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Marathon in July<\/a> (with a variable interest rate then priced at 7.25% from Silvergate Bank). Bitdeer did not disclose more details about how it will structure deals.","Yet interest rates for public miners have generally trended downward since January 2020, according to data compiled by public relations firm BlocksBridge in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getrevue.co\/profile\/BlocksBridge\/issues\/miner-weekly-why-lending-rates-have-been-declining-1370966\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Miner Weekly newsletter<\/a>. It also points out that other variables included in the loan terms should be taken into consideration.","\"Most of the loans we analyzed had a maturity term ranging from 24 to 36 months while several were short-term bridge notes, lasting from 1 to 6 months,\" the newsletter said. \"Some of the loans also included specific covenants on a borrower\u2019s financial health like coverage ratios, which provided additional color on how TradFi organizations evaluate mining companies.\"","","","Icebreaker's interest rates reflect current market conditions, where the hashrate is reaching record highs while the coin is down 70% from its record price, said Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at FRNT Financial.","\"The possibility of bitcoin moving lower means that lenders in the mining space are being extremely cautious. There is plenty of risk right now,\" Savic said.","Savic went on to highlight a \"solvency crisis\" in the crypto space, which recent legal moves in the sector demonstrate.","Bitcoin mining hosting provider Compute North <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172246\/compute-north-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week<\/a>.
