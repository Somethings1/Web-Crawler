He said he's noticed that as bitcoin upside drives valuations up, any market downsides simply cause bitcoin company valuations to remain relatively neutral. He had this to say:","\"I saw that you can have a productive portfolio of assets withstand an unbelievable bear market without even having a negative mark. And so in 2018, what brought me to this idea to some degree, was in '18 bitcoin was down 80 percent, Ethereum 95 percent, but a basket of companies that we looked at broadly maintained their value. So to me, that's like mind blowing. I can build a portfolio that has access to all of the upside, not just of Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the entire space without having to suffer, hopefully, much on the downside... For institutions, especially, this is a very attractive type of portfolio.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tapiero also sees a case for youth advocacy of cryptocurrencies as a means of holding sway over politics, with lobbyists backing certain political candidates based on their views of cryptocurrency. \u201CI think there's certainly a strong case to be made that as the younger people come into political power, that we're going to have a transition in the way that people are viewing the crypto business.\u201D<\/span>","© 2023 The Block.
