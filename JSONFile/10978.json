This committee will distribute 900 million Starknet (STRK) tokens in a phased manner to reward past and future contributions by users and community members. This initial distribution phase may begin in the first half of 2024.","This plan follows the foundation\u2019s recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/265588\/starknet-foundation-confirms-screenshots-showing-draft-airdrop-plans-says-snapshot-already-taken\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">confirmation<\/a> of a token airdrop snapshot, which became known after a draft of the eligibility criteria (for the planned airdrop) briefly appeared on its website and was circulated on social media.","\u201CWe\u2019ve been working on the first phase of distributions for a while now, and we are close to getting this over the line.
