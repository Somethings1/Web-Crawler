Combine an international clientele, a U.S.-hosted database, and a foreign liquidation proceeding and you apparently get a Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceeding and a federal bankruptcy judge.","Cryptopia was a New Zealand-based digital asset exchange \u201Cthrough which Cryptopia\u2019s millions of account holders traded hundreds of different types of digital assets.\u201D Earlier this year, \u201CCryptopia suffered a serious hack; the hackers looted some $16 million worth of digital assets owned by various account holders. To date, none of the stolen assets have been recovered.\u201D","According to motion papers filed by Cryptopia\u2019s lawyers, the company was put into \u201Cliquidation\u201D proceedings in New Zealand on May 14. Liquidation is similar to bankruptcy but not exactly the same thing. It provides a way for an insolvent company to wind up its business in an orderly fashion, pay off creditors to the extent possible, and do so under judicial supervision.","Under U.S. bankruptcy code, a foreign company that enters something similar to bankruptcy protection in its own country can move for recognition of that foreign proceeding in the U.S. Why would someone do that, you ask? Bankruptcy provides you with certain protections\u200A\u2014\u200Alitigation and asset recovery are stayed, and the bankruptcy court can take steps to protect the bankrupt company\u2019s property. (I am over-simplifying quite a bit, but this is the gist).","In this case, Cryptopia\u2019s customer data is apparently stored \u201Con servers operated by Phoenix NAP LLC (\u2018PNAP\u2019), a company based in Arizona. In particular, PNAP hosts an SQL (i.e., Structured Query Language) database that contains information about which account holders own which digital assets and in what quantities. Additionally, the PNAP-hosted database contains the most current list of, and contact details for, all of Cryptopia\u2019s account holders.\u201D","Cryptopia says it asked PNAP for assurance that it would not do anything to compromise Cryptopia data but says that it didn\u2019t receive a satisfactory response, with PNAP responding \u201Cwe will not do anything to your equipment.\u201D","Because a New Zealand judicial proceeding has no authority to order an Arizona company to do, well, anything, Cryptopia filed a \u201CMotion for Recognition and Emergency Motion for Provisional Relief.\u201D The Court granted the Motion on May 24, ordering $274,408.92 to be paid to PNAP for services for May and June 2019 as security for entry of a temporary restraining order.","For readers interested in the ins and outs of New Zealand liquidation proceedings, the Motion papers filed by Cryptopia\u2019s lawyers are an interesting read (and you can find a link to that above). Also interesting is the fact that (per these papers) most of the account holders at Cryptopia were located outside of New Zealand. In fact, \u201CBased on transactions in November and December 2018, trades involving U.S.-based account holders generated the majority of Cryptopia\u2019s revenues.\u201D","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
