Meanwhile, investment banks such as Goldman Sachs are sounding the alarms about double-digit percent unemployment.&nbsp;<\/span>","During an interview on The Scoop, Lee said that while the economic data will continue to be brutal, last week\u2019s stock market action indicates a possible bottom for the market. He added further bad data might be priced in if that's the case.&nbsp;","\"Stocks did something really important last week,\" Lee said. \"Equity market has found some stability.\"","The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a low of 18,591 last Monday and has since picked up 13%. Despite this morning's unemployment data, stocks have rallied slightly, trading up 0.30% since Tuesday's close. Lee said that it is possible a V-shaped recovery is in the works.&nbsp;","\"Stock market bottom before economic data bottoms,\" Lee said. \"It isn't the day jobless claims peak of unemployment peaks.\"","Lee reemphasized his claim today on Twitter, noting, \"Something to keep in mind, in 2001-2003 and 2007-2009 bear market, stocks bottom before PEAK jobless claims.\"","","","On The Scoop, Lee said that it has typically taken markets about three times longer to recover than the time it took to draw down to the bottom. Looking at the past 10 major stock market declines of &gt;30%, the median time to new highs is 2.5x the time of the drawdown, with half of total losses recovered in only .5x the amount of time.","","","If that market truism holds, and March 23 is the true bottom, back of the envelope math suggests a three-month recovery \u2014 contingent on total case count peaking in April.","Still, this crisis is unique as it is just as much a health crisis as it is an economic crisis. As such, it is not clear whether the market is more concerned about economic indicators, such as unemployment and jobless claim, or health data, such as cases and mortalities, Lee conceded.","Not everyone is convinced of Lee's thesis, as shown by this handy report by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-04-02\/economists-debate-shape-of-a-global-recovery-after-coronavirus\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bloomberg<\/a>. Many economists doubt that a V-shaped recovery will play out given the uncertainty around when lock-downs and social distancing rules will be in place.","Chong Hoon Park, head of Korea economic research at Standard Chartered Bank Korea, told Bloomberg he anticipates a more U-shaped recovery.&nbsp;","\u201CI think the Chinese slowdown is going to drag on,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019m not that optimistic we\u2019re going to see a V-shaped recovery, with the Chinese recovery unclear.\"","There's also the risk of the virus making a comeback after the initial ongoing spread, which could result in a W shape, according to Bloomberg.&nbsp;","\u201CThe key risk to our baseline V forecast is a potential return of the virus in the third quarter,\u201D Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroder Investment Management, told Bloomberg. \u201CIn economic terms this would lead to a double-dip recession with businesses closing again as restrictions on movement are re-imposed.\u201D","&nbsp;","<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fZfojuoxwhQ?start=6\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>"],"hashtag":[]}
