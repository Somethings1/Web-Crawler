Please note that as per our Terms of Use, we are unable to service US persons. Please register for an account over at our partner, Binance US.\"","The email continues: \"You have 14 days to close all active positions on your account and withdraw all your funds, failing which your account will be locked. Once your account is locked, you will have to raise a customer service ticket for us to assist you further.\"","Decrypt first <a href=\"https:\/\/decrypt.co\/49317\/binance-gives-us-users-14-days-to-leave-exchange\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> the existence of the emails with the 14-day withdrawal window.","The recent measures suggest that Binance is beefing up its efforts to block U.S. residents from its platform. Last year, Binance said it would stop serving U.S. residents from September. But until now, the exchange was still effectively allowing U.S. users to access its platform.","As The Block reported recently, a U.S. resident just had to click \"I'm not [American]\" to set up an account on Binance.com. It remains possible to create an account in this manner.","Following the publication of this story, a spokesperson for Binance told The Block:","\"At Binance, we take regulatory compliance seriously and we are always working towards aligning with local, regional and global standards and best practices. As part of our efforts, we constantly perform periodic reviews on all of our users to ensure no one is in breach of our Terms of Use.<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/i>","We also have procedures in place to offboard any users who we have reasonable cause to believe are U.S. persons or are in violation of our Terms of Use. This is an existing control and is not something that is new. As per our email notifying the user of the detection, any user who receives it has 14 days to completely withdraw all their funds before restrictions and offboarding measures kick in.\"","© 2023 The Block.
