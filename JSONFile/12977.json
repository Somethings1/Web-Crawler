By these groundbreaking functions, Trava has changed the way lending operations are conducted all over the crypto world these days because other lending platforms only have a single lending pool with rigid rules defined by themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Trava - The groundbreaking protocol of lending<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Trava aims to provide users with the optimal lending functions by supporting users of lending services through on-chain data analysis mechanisms. Currently, Trava Finance is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), allowing for lending with BSC tokens at initial stages and cross-chain lending available after.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Furthermore, as an innovative lending platform with the long-term vision of diversifying forms of lending, the Trava team offers players with NFTs Renting Service, which plays as a peer-to-peer renting platform.&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Addressing today's concerns of NFTs&nbsp;<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this day and age, a growing trend in the NFTs sector is for projects to encompass community benefits that go along with the ownership of their tokens. Hence, players also want to retain the possession of precious NFTs to earn tremendous profits.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Trava team aims to revolutionize the thriving play-to-earn industry by unfolding the possibility for owners to monetize their idle in-game digital assets without selling them. Specifically, Trava provides a pool and a marketplace where players can deposit and list their spare NFTs to lend out for a specific amount of time. The fundamental principle of this system is that the ownership of these NFTs can not be transferred without the owners' permission. On the other hand, the advent of Trava rental service also opens the avenue for borrowers to temporarily use NFTs with small funds to earn profits if they otherwise do not want to purchase or are not for sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Trava's future scope is to integrate NFTs Renting Service into multiple play-to-earn platforms for the sake of players. At the first stage, Trava has established partnership and integration of NFTs Rental Feature for Kawaii Islands. This NFT play-to-earn game creates a fantasy universe on the cloud for multi-players to experience simulation gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sharing about this partnership, CTO &amp; Co-founder of Trava Finance, Mr. Thang Nguyen said: \"\u200B\u200BThis is a combination of Defi and Gamefi to open a new horizon. We believe that this partnership can prove how NFTs are used in TRAVA Lending Ecosystem and demonstrate unique utilities the team brings to users.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To celebrate this milestone, there will be an NFTs staking program with attractive incentives for early stakers. The details will be announced soon on Trava's official channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","Currently Trava has launched a marketplace for users to rent out their NFTs. This brings great meaning to Trava and its users. Trava welcomes cooperation with Gamefi and NFT projects alike, making it a diverse marketplace with many user benefits.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Follow Trava's official channels to find more detail:&nbsp;<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/trava.finance\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Website<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/trava_finance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Telegram<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/trava_finance_official\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Announcement<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/trava_finance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.trava.finance\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Medium<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> |<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TravaFinance\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reddit<\/span><\/a>","Â© 2023 The Block.
