Olympus will provide a \"consolidated platform for open and sustainable project acceleration by providing access to grants, crowdfunding, VC investments, and referrals all in one place and on-chain,\" Dfinity said in its statement.","Last month, in an <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/dfinity\/the-history-of-the-internet-computer-in-10-steps-1fe956475625\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">online post<\/a>, Dfinity founder and Chief Scientist Dominic Williams called Internet Computer \"the only blockchain to run with fully-automated DAO governance and true autonomy.\" Williams is also the founder of the Internet Computer blockchain.","\"Traditional accelerator programs are permissioned and operate as silos, many are also not sustainable and rely on grants. Olympus is a new model,\" Williams also said in the statement.","Hong Kong-based Web3Labs will provide additional support to the Olympus platform.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
