The trader then pockets the difference in interest rates between the two.","\"Funding currencies such as USD and EUR are already well-represented on-chain, we are completing the equation,\" said Joao Aguiar, co-founder of ECSA, in the release.","Stablecoins are digital currencies where their value is pegged to a reserve asset such as the US dollar or gold. They have been in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/211214\/sec-action-against-paxos-paints-regulatory-target-on-stablecoins\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">spotlight<\/a> recently after regulated stablecoin issuer Paxos was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210932\/paxos-will-no-longer-issue-binance-usd-stablecoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ordered<\/a> to stop issuing its Binance USD stablecoin (BUSD) by The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).","ECSA will start by bringing the Brazilian Real on chain. Its BRLe stablecoin is collateralized with Brazilian Treasury Bills and is held in custody by Itau-Unibanco, which is the largest private sector bank in Brazil.","\u201CBRLe is currently issued on the Stellar network and is in the process of being issued on Ethereum ERC-20,\u201D said Rodrigo Marino, co-founder of ECSA, in the release. \u201CECSA will be providing a market-making solution to ensure liquidity for the BRLe, making it more easily interchangeable with other tokens such as USDc and USDt.\u201D","The startup intends to pass the returns from the collateral back to the token holders, which the co-founders believe will enable users to perform carry trade operations on-chain and capture the Brazilian sovereign yield.","Latin America was the seventh largest cryptocurrency market in the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chainalysis\/status\/1583490267784437762?lang=en-GB\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Chainalysis index<\/a> last year.
