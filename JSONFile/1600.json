But Coinbase, whose stock has been f<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lirting with an all-time low, laid the ground for optimism in its 2023 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/institutional\/research-insights\/research\/market-intelligence\/2023-crypto-market-outlook\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto Market Outlook<\/a>.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Factors including sustainable tokenomics, ecosystem maturity and relative market liquidity are expected to drive \u201Chigher-quality\u201D cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH, which could create \u201Ckey value opportunities,\u201D according to the report.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMany traditional risk assets still seem rich, and the investment theses for cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH have not fundamentally changed in our view,\u201D Coinbase wrote. However, in order to decouple them from traditional risk assets, digital currencies will require a \u201Cdifferentiated catalyst\u201D in the first quarter of 2023.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are likely to move toward self-custody as industry players believe a mixture of DeFi and centralized platforms, or hybrids of the two, were mainly responsible for past transgressions in the crypto space.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As an alternative to those failed centralized financial institutions such as Celsius, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), and FTX, DeFi better exhibits trust and transparency features \u201Cgiven its on-chain, auditable properties,\u201D Coinbase said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the future, there may be \u201Cgreater demand for permissioned or \u2018enhanced\u2019 DeFi that marries institutional-grade compliance standards with code-enforced transparency.\u201D Such permissioned networks would be capable of solving problems like undercollateralized credit with anti-money laundering compliant \u201Cprice permissioned liquidity pools,\u201D said Coinbase.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CBorrowing in the crypto space has become incredibly challenging in 2022 as a result of all the credit that has been withdrawn from the system,\u201D Coinbase said. However, lender impairment persisting from the implosion of Celsius and 3AC indicates a continuation of ongoing consolidation as opposed to \u201Crenewed pressure on these entities\" after the collapse of FTX.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CMore than likely, we will see a maturation of lending practices in the crypto space, including underwriting standards, appropriate collateralization, and asset\/liability management,\u201D Coinbase said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Future lending inventories will be sourced via institutional investors instead of a retail base, according to the report. While it may take a few months for institutional credit activity to attain previous levels, \u201Cborrowing will likely not be a challenge for credit-worthy, responsible borrowers.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe think investors\u2019 willingness to accumulate altcoins has been severely impacted by the deleveraging in 2022 and may take many months to fully recuperate,\u201D Coinbase said, referencing newer projects exposed in some way to FTX.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As for bitcoin miners, \u201Cprecarious economic conditions\u201D show no signs of improvement, with mining companies selling nearly \u201C135% of coins mined per day, meaning miners are liquidating the entirety of their newly mined coins as well as portions of their BTC reserves.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Miners facing \u201Chigher input costs and lower output value\u201D in conjunction with the rising cost of power contributed to a \u201Chighly stressed economic environment,\u201D according to Coinbase.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although the report also pointed to the financial woes of mining company Core Scientific as a potential industry indicator, a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/195146\/b-riley-offers-72-million-to-mining-firm-core-scientific\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">structured deal<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> from main creditor and financing firm B.
