The main way of doing that is to get an iris scanned by one of Worldcoin\u2019s orbs. Over 1.7 million people have already signed up \u2014 the majority of them in the Global South.","But as its launch nears, scammers are finding ways to cheat the system.","BlockBeats, a Chinese news site, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BlockBeatsAsia\/status\/1659060950748782594?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said in tweets posted earlier today<\/a> that people in China \u2014 where people cannot yet sign up to receive a share of the Worldcoin token when it launches \u2014 are purchasing iris scans taken in Cambodia and Africa for as little as $30. The news <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mattysino\/status\/1659084612448993282?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">drew sharp criticism<\/a> from Twitter users.","A spokesperson for Worldcoin acknowledged these incidents in a written statement sent to The Block, but stressed that the problem was confined to \u201Ca few hundred instances.\u201D","\u201CThrough ongoing threat and awareness monitoring measures, the Worldcoin team identified suspicious and potentially fraudulent activity whereby individuals were incentivized to sign up for a verified World ID that was then delivered to a third party\u2019s World App rather than their own,\u201D they said.","Worldcoin has taken several steps to try to contain the issue. Those include \u201Cadjustments to the initial in-person signup process and the implementation of dynamic vs static QR codes,\u201D the spokesperson said.","The project had previously <a href=\"https:\/\/worldcoin.org\/blog\/engineering\/humanness-in-the-age-of-ai\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">addressed the subject of account theft<\/a> in a blog post published in March. \u201COnce a proof of personhood is granted, it is crucial to ensure that it is difficult to sell or steal, yet easy to recover,\u201D Worldcoin said in the blog post.","It explained that users could reclaim their World ID \u2014 their verified account \u2014 by getting scanned by an orb a second time. This, Worldcoin said, would help deter the illegitimate sale of proof-of-personhood credentials.","\u201CDespite these precautions, it is important to acknowledge that they do not entirely safeguard against collusion or other attempts to bypass the one-person-one-proof principle. To address these challenges, innovative ideas in mechanism design and the attribution of social relationships will be necessary,\u201D the project added.","Worldcoin has said previously that its token will go live in the first half of this year. The project <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229742\/sam-altman-worldcoin-app-token\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rolled out its self-custodial mobile app<\/a> in early May.","The organization is currently valued at $3 billion after reportedly raising $100 million from Khosla Ventures and a16z in March 2022. The Block <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210014\/sam-altman-worldcoin-fundraise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">revealed in February<\/a> that the company is seeking another round of funding at the same valuation.","Â© 2023 The Block.
