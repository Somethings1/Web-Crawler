During that flight, a bevy of sensors kept tabs on the steak and uploaded readings to the HerdX blockchain, according to the press release.","It was delivered to a Ruby Jack\u2019s steakhouse in Tokyo. There, guests could order the steak and view its freight provenance via QR code. Diplomats in Tokyo celebrated its arrival last Friday and dined on the steak, the firms said.","Romaine Seguin, President of UPS Global Freight Forwarding, said in a statement that a lot went into the project:","Used by firms as a means to verify the provenance and freshness of food products on the way to stores \u2013 as well as as a marketing method to appeal to health, environment and animal welfare-conscious consumers \u2013 blockchain tracing platforms are starting to make their way into the supply chains of major companies like Walmart, Carrefour and Cargill.","The initiative adds to blockchain-based works underway by UPS, including inking a deal in March with e-commerce company Inxeption to develop a platform based on the tech to facilitate business-to-business sales. The firm has also applied for a patent for a concept that uses blockchain as part of a distributed system for sending packages worldwide.","Tracking app image courtesy UPS; Japanese beef dish image via Shutterstock"],"entity":[{"type":"Creekstone","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tokyo","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Romaine Seguin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Arkansas City","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shutterstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Jack\u2019s","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Cargill","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Walmart","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Kansas","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Carrefour","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UPS","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["News","Supply Chain","UPS","beef","HerdX","Creekstone Farms","business news"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
