However, the analysts also expect more than $2.4 billion will flow into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in Q1 and keep prices elevated, if they're approved.","VanEck believes the spot bitcoin ETFs would trade at around 0.1% spreads, with zero commission at many brokerages, catalyzing demand.","The Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., having previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/120956\/proshares-announces-tuesday-listing-of-bitcoin-futures-etf-bito\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">approved<\/a> futures-based funds in 2021. The next deadlines for the SEC\u2019s decision to approve, reject or delay applications from firms including VanEck as well as BlackRock, Bitwise, WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity and Valkyrie are expected to fall in mid-January.

Like past cycles, VanEck expects bitcoin to lead the rally next year, with ether not beginning to outperform until after the halving.
