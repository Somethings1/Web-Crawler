The share of AI and meme tokens in the overall crypto market cap rebounded in February, they added.","Retail interest in crypto also surged towards the end of last year, mirroring the momentum seen in equities during the fourth quarter of 2023, the analysts noted. That surge is corroborated by quarterly reports from traditional brokerage firms such as Block, PayPal, and Robinhood, which offer crypto trading and custody services to retail customers, they said. These platforms experienced increased trading activity and investor flow during the fourth quarter, and similarly, crypto exchanges like Coinbase also noted a rise in trading activity among retail investors during that period, the analysts added.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Recent retail impulse could be attributed to three main upcoming crypto catalysts \u2014 the <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248348\/bitcoin-btc-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/bitcoin.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">BTC<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_positive\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      +0.47%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> halving event, the next major upgrade of the <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum <\/span><span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248349\/ethereum-eth-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ethereum.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">ETH<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -0.67%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span><\/span> network called Dencun, and the prospect of approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. in May \u2014 the analysts said.<\/span>","The first two catalysts, however, are \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/267539\/jpmorgan-ether-outperform-bitcoin-2024\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">largely priced in<\/a>,\" while the chance of approval for Ethereum ETFs in May is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/272417\/spot-ethereum-etf-approval-chance-jpmorgan\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">only 50%<\/a>, the analysts reiterated.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
