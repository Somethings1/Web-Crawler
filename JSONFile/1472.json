He said the company expects to use Apex\u2019s existing partnerships with companies like Webull, M1, Public.com and Stash to expand internationally.&nbsp;","As these companies establish themselves internationally to offer U.S. equities trading, Bakkt can add crypto trading alongside them, he claimed, resulting in a low barrier to entry. That said, Bakkt has already hit some hurdles, having <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235150\/bakkt-delists-solana-polygon-cardano-amid-regulatory-uncertainty\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">delisted<\/a> 25 tokens on the platform due to regulatory concerns.","The Bakkt CEO said there\u2019s more traction in crypto markets outside the U.S. since they\u2019re moving faster in terms of regulatory clarity.","\u201CAnd when you pull back further from the U.S. and you look at what\u2019s happening in other markets, we see them moving slightly ahead of where we are,\u201D he said. He noted that the UK is moving forward with clear crypto regulation, that Hong Kong is allowing trading in certain cryptocurrencies and that the EU has passed its MiCA framework for crypto regulation.","Michael said that he supports the recent regulatory actions in the U.S. but added that the country needs to go further in providing clear regulatory clarity, particularly at the federal level.","This perceived murkiness has had an impact on Bakkt\u2019s ability to work with companies in the U.S., he said. While Bakkt launched with a number of large partnerships \u2014 with companies such as Microsoft and Starbucks \u2014&nbsp;Michael said many firms are waiting for regulatory clarity before moving into the space.&nbsp;","Michael also noted that while its custody service seen a lot of traction, trading is moving at a slower pace.","\u201CWhen we think about trading, trading is really heavily influenced by regulatory clarity. We\u2019ve seen that in the overseas markets where regulatory clarity has led to a change in consumer sentiment. It\u2019s really helped provide the operating rules for folks who are supporting trading platforms,\u201D he said.","Michael also noted that Bakkt is exploring the use of the Bitcoin Layer 2 Lightning Network for custody and settlement, explaining that it can be used for financial services like cross-border payments."],"hashtag":[]}
