The posts also misled consumers by not making it clear that fan tokens were a cryptoasset that had to be bought using another cryptocurrency, the regulator said.&nbsp;<\/span>","Arsenal had partnered with Socios, which uses blockchain technology to provide fan tokens, collectibles and other digital assets to sports organizations. The club's fan token, $AFC, can only be purchased on the Socios app using the cryptocurrency Chiliz ($CHZ), which was also invented by Socios.&nbsp;","Arsenal argued the promotion of the tokens was \"<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">designed to raise awareness of [...] the opportunity to interact with the Club such as the right to vote on official Club decisions.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The soccer club added that fan tokens were not promoted as financial products or an investment vehicle and it did not encourage the trading of fan tokens.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It also said it believed Socios was well-known in the footballing community as a cryptocurrency platform because it sponsored and partnered with a number of European soccer clubs.<\/span>","Nevertheless, the ASA ruled the ads must not appear again in the form they were complained about.
