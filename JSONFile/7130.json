This is in sharp contrast to DeFi, where all trade information is available for anyone to see.","Renegade's tech is designed to improve price execution in DeFi by preventing behavior such as front-running, sandwiches and statistical arbitrage. It aims to provide a trustless platform for trades that avoids the dangers of current decentralized exchanges, the company said. As such, it will anonymously cross order flow directly at midpoint prices.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
