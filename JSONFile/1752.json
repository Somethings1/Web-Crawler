To recover their funds, customers will need to provide two details \u2014 the Ethereum transaction ID for the transaction where the asset was lost and the contract address of the lost asset \u2014 Coinbase said.","The feature is not available for Coinbase's Japan and Prime (or institutional) customers, the company said.","Coinbase rival Binance does not offer coin recoveries. Still, if a customer has suffered a \"significant loss\" due to incorrectly depositing unlisted tokens, Binance may assist them in recovering those tokens solely at its discretion, and the recovery isn't guaranteed, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/support\/faq\/frequently-asked-questions-on-incorrect-deposits-115003798632\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">information<\/a> on its website.","Coinbase said it is the first major crypto company to offer ERC-20 recoveries at scale while preserving the security of customer deposit addresses. \"We\u2019re reducing the points of friction and focus on improving usability to better serve and earn the trust of mass consumers,\" it added.","Earlier this week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194804\/coinbase-ceo-says-market-fear-and-volatility-are-a-moment-to-shine\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">told<\/a> staff in a memo that it is the company's \"moment to shine\" amid market fear and volatility.
