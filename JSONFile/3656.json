Around the same time, Templum publicly announced a significant pivot in its business model from facilitating digital securities offerings on public blockchains, to using a private blockchain it was building with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/security-token-startup-templum-shifts-private-blockchains-symbiont\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Symbiont<\/a>. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Regardless, it is critical that thoughtful analysis be given to new innovations without jumping to an immediate conclusion that they create issues under federal securities laws. A decision to classify miners as broker-dealers would have grave implications for innovation and growth in the industry.<\/span>","","","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What are Ethereum miners actually doing?<\/b><\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As the majority of digital securities offerings to date have utilized the public Ethereum blockchain, this analysis focuses specifically on activities of Ethereum miners on the public chain. <\/i><\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum, like other blockchains, is a digital ledger system that records the occurrence of events and certain identifying information about those events (e.g. its participants). While the events being recorded on the blockchain are colloquially referred to as \u201Ctransactions\u201D, it is important to note that not all of them involve the exchange of value. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Transactions, in this context, represent units of work performed by a computer system. A transaction might be a purchase or sale of cryptocurrency like Ether, but it also might be a record of title for a plot of land.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Prior to being recorded on the ledger, transactions are processed by a network of high-speed computers called \u201Cminers\u201D. When a transaction is proposed on the Ethereum blockchain, it is randomly sent to miners for confirmation. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Miners then aggregate that transaction with other unrelated transactions into a \u201Cblock\u201D (i.e., a group of transactions) and are able to confirm those transactions by solving cryptographic equations that require significant computing power. The miner that solves the equation quickest confirms the transactions within the corresponding block and the transactions are then recorded on the blockchain. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The miner then finally receives payment from the network in the form of Ether for its efforts. The amount of Ether dispensed to a miner is determined by block without reference to the block\u2019s contents. As of June 2019, Ethereum miners receive two Ether per confirmed block.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Do miners' activities fit within the scope of broker-dealer regulation?<\/b><\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With limited exception, all persons who are deemed to be brokers or dealers are required to register with the SEC in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The miner is oblivious to the block\u2019s contents when it confirms the transactions within, and it remains so when it receives payment in Ether upon completion of the block. <\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Furthermore, the amount of Ether paid to miners is fixed per block.
