European institutions reached an agreement on MiCA in June and it has since generally been welcomed by the crypto industry as means to improve credibility and streamline an otherwise fragmented regulatory landscape.","CZ also expressed some concerns over MiCA, however: particularly its limitations on stablecoins. The current MiCA report restricts the issuance of US dollar-pegged stablecoins, which could lead to their eventual ban from the EU bloc.","Blockchain for Europe and the Digital Euro Association, two lobby groups, share CZ\u2019s concerns and wrote a letter to the EU Council in August to try to undo the restriction as logistical details are ironed out in the European institutions.","\u201CThe three largest stablecoins by trade volume are at risk of being banned in the EU from 2024, due to quantitative limits on issuance and use of [e-money tokens] denominated in foreign currency under MiCA,\u201D the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockchain4europe.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/BC4EU-Letter-on-MiCA-restrictions-to-EMTs-referencing-USD.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter<\/a> reads.","Nonetheless, CZ concluded that \u201Coverall, MiCA is fantastic\u201D.","As it was being drafted, MiCA was designed to give Europe a headstart in global crypto regulation. The legislation regulates cryptocurrencies and service providers across the EU\u2019s member states.","Stefan Berger, the lead negotiator on MiCA for the European Parliament, told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theparliamentmagazine.eu\/news\/article\/crypto-regulation-passes-in-parliament-but-amendment-addressing-environmental-concerns-is-rejected\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Parliament Magazine<\/a> in an email correspondence in March that \u201Cbecause it is the first of its kind, MiCA has the potential to serve as a global role model.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
