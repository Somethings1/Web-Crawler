The publication will also help the companies see what regulations apply to their business and whether they require any regulatory authorisations.&nbsp;","And it's slowly making headway too, having <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/07\/03\/its-still-too-early-for-proper-institutions-to-invest-but-were-ready-says-uks-first-regulated-crypto-hedge-fund\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">approved<\/a> the UK's first crypto asset manager earlier this month.","But by concentrating its hiring efforts in intelligence and crime divisions, the FCA may be looking at hardening the relatively laissez-faire stance it has adopted in the UK until now.","Indeed, the regulator is already set to tighten its scrutiny of the space. Per this week's announcement, the FCA will also be <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/uks-new-economic-crime-plan-includes-action-on-cryptocurrencies\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in charge<\/a> of maintaining a \u201Cstrong AML [anti-money laundering] regime\u201D for cryptocurrency companies, following new laws set out by the UK government, scheduled for January 2020. The FCA also recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/uks-financial-watchdog-proposes-to-ban-crypto-derivatives-for-retail-investors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">proposed a ban<\/a> on the sale of cryptocurrency derivatives and exchange-traded notes to retail investors, saying the assets are \u201Cill-suited\u201D for consumers who lack understanding of the products.&nbsp;","The responsibility may lie with the FCA's new crypto-crime team, which is expected to have direct contact with high-risk companies, involving \"regular anti-money laundering visits,\" according to the new job description. It also notes that the recruit will report \"on how firms manage various financial crime risks,\" and the controls in place.","Meanwhile, the position of crypto intelligence associate is described as involving \"considerable amounts of liaison and stakeholder management\" with different government agencies. The aim is to obtain information on \"crypto assets, financial and economic crime linked themes and the role of various processes [] in regulating this activity,\" and to help the FCA make informed decisions about specific cases.","Regulatory uncertainty is a commonly cited concern for major institutions. Additionally, the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/bitcoin-atms-being-used-for-drug-money-laundering-in-spain-as-dealers-exploit-loophole-in-existing-eu-law\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Spanish police<\/a> have argued for tighter anti-money laundering controls around crypto, after discovering that bitcoin ATMs were being used to launder drug money.","Â© 2023 The Block.
