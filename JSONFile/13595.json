Capital is important, too, but those are the three KPIs we look at all day long.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While the price of bitcoin will always be prone to fluctuation, the energy cost for bitcoin miners is typically predictable since it is purchased on long-term contracts. As Thiel explains:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CJust like the airline industry will hedge their fuel purchases by buying futures on fuel, when we write a hosting agreement, we are locking in a fixed price for five years. So our cost of hosting, which is energy hosting, services, etc., is locked in a little over $0.04 a kilowatt hour for five years. And our energy provider has to take out the hedges to make sure that they're not upside down on the energy cost.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The third consideration \u2014 the ability to deploy and access hardware \u2014 is often a bottleneck for Marathon, because the company has to wait on government bodies to approve operational permits.<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">During this episode, Chaparro and Thiel also discuss:<\/em>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This episode is brought to you by our sponsors&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fireblocks.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/coinbase.com\/prime\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase Prime<\/a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/crossriver.com\/crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Cross River<\/a><br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/b><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fireblocks is an enterprise-grade platform delivering a secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets.
