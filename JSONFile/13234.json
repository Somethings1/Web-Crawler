This means users can hone in on real-time data across multiple chains, reshape it through a data streaming platform and serve up the final result directly to a website via an API.&nbsp;","This, Goldsky says, solves one of the most costly problems faced by the industry, which is reading and processing data from deployed smart contracts.&nbsp;","\u201CTeams often find themselves doing significant amounts of data engineering to aggregate and process decentralized activity. This can run up tens of thousands of dollars and more importantly, take valuable time away from the core product,\u201D it said in a statement.","The company's current customer base includes POAP, Polymarket and Arweave.","Goldsky is among a clutch of other firms that are fighting for a corner in the blockchain data space.
