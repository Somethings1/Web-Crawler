ICO was way too founder-friendly. Venture capital is too investor-friendly. So the CSO model is this interesting balance between the two,\u201D said Fairmint CEO and cofounder Thibauld Favre.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">How it works<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Specifically, a company looking to raise money through a CSO will first commit to putting a certain percentage of its future revenues into a reserve (held in escrow) for a set period. Investors on the Fairmint platform can then buy claims to the reserve, represented by ERC-20 tokens.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The initial price of the tokens will be calculated based on the size of the reserve by an algorithm. I<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">nvestors can then trade these tokens via decentralized exchange Uniswap and the price will subsequently be determined by market demand. They can also choose to redeem these tokens from the company, and the redemption price will also be calculated based on the reserve and change as the reserve size fluctuates.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Each CSO will last for a period of time set by the company. During the period, investors can continuously trade these tokens based on their confidence in the company and their prediction of its future revenues. Once the company decides to end the CSO, it is responsible for buying back all the outstanding tokens at the price paid for the final token minted.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Money raised through the CSO will fund the company, and if the company chooses to, it can direct a portion of the fund back into the reserve.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Why it matters<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although many different matrices can measure a company\u2019s success, Fairmint believes that a focus on revenues can foster healthy company growth.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWorking with equity is extremely hard, while working on revenue is much easier and much more healthy\u2026 And to rely on revenue generation, we think it's a very positive and healthy thing. Revenues are also very easy to audit,\u201D said Favre.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This ethos is felt across the startup ecosystem, as the WeWork Initial Public Offering (IPO) fiasco serves as a&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/ipo-investors-are-pushing-back-on-growth-at-all-costs-private-companies-2019-09-26\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cautionary warning<\/span><\/a>&nbsp;to<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> many founders and investors against the growth-at-all-costs model fueled by venture money.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As such, Fairmint targets companies that have viable business models and can generate revenues. Conducting CSO also does not prevent the companies from raising equity rounds or getting publicly listed, since no shares are offered via CSO.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Next step<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Starting on Feb. 6 at 2 PM EST, any companies and individuals can register accounts on the Fairmint platform. The first CSO will begin on Feb. 19, and Fairmint itself will be the token issuer.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Since Fairmint is a U.S.-based company and it considers its CSO an offering of securities, the tokens will only be available to non-U.S. users and accredited investors in the U.S. to be compliant with the securities law.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe value of the token is really in the token, it\u2019s not like in an STO (security token offering) where the value of the token is just a piece of paper saying that you have a share somewhere. Here the token has its own value,\u201D said Favre.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>"],"hashtag":["FUNDRAISING","UNISWAP"]}
