The business has already signed up its first batch of customers for the white-label platform in Europe and Asia.","The Helsinki-based lender is targeting mid-sized crypto businesses \u2014 such as wallets and exchanges \u2014 that are competing with giants like Binance and Coinbase, but which often lack the resources to devise interest-bearing products on their own.","All of these companies are looking for \u201Csticky\u201D products to help retain their customers, according to Wu. \u201CYield products are a way to do it,\u201D he said. \u201CThey will essentially be able to offer their clients a BlockFi, Celsius-esque product.\u201D","Tesseract Earn will enable partners to offer interest-bearing products with a risk and return profile of their choosing. Tesseract will generate yield for end-users through three main avenues: borrowing and lending; market making and arbitrage-based strategies; and DeFi yield farming.","Wu described credit as \u201Cthe unsexy part of crypto,\u201D but added that it\u2019s also one of the most difficult to crack.","\u201CYou have a lot of those retail-facing platforms that are out there, that in my personal opinion... are just like a semi-time bomb that is waiting to explode,\u201D he said, pointing to the hedge fund-like activity that underpins such accounts and a lack of regulation as major concerns. Tesseract is supervised by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.","Founded in December 2017, Tesseract has until now operated quietly as a B2B-only company focused on lending out deposits from institutions and sophisticated investors. Wu likened the business to Genesis, the US crypto trading heavyweight.","Its profile was boosted by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/108779\/finnish-crypto-lender-tesseract-25-million-investment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a $25 million Series A fundraise<\/a> led by Augmentum Fintech in June 2021. Half a dozen venture capital firms, including LeadBlock Partners, Coinbase Ventures and trading firm Wintermute, also participated in the raise.","Wu said that Tesseract was cash flow positive by the time the Series A funds came in, but chose to raise anyway \u2014 primarily to instil confidence in potential partners.","\u201CWhen we started to deal with a lot of larger financial institutions, regulated entities\u2026 Their first line of reference point is: who has invested in you? Has any famous investor put a stamp on you, so we know you\u2019re not a scam? Which is a silly thing, but it\u2019s a strong signal to the market,\u201D Wu explained.","Most of the $25 million is still sitting in the bank, he added.","Since the raise, Tesseract\u2019s headcount has grown from 6 to around 40. Revenues and lending are also up substantially, with the firm\u2019s outstanding loan book now in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Wu is hoping that the Earn platform \u2014 which he said takes aim at a \u201Cneglected market segment\u201D \u2014 can help boost that number to a couple of billion dollars by year-end."],"hashtag":["LENDING"]}
