The comments came in the agency\u2019s case against Terraform Labs and its former CEO Do Kwon.","\u201CSEC staff is considering the various available avenues for further review and intends to recommend that the SEC seek such review,\u201D the lawyers continued.","The filing signals a likely appeal of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239559\/sec-faces-wake-up-call-after-ripple-ruling-though-appeal-likely\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">portion<\/a> of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235926\/sec-lawsuit-over-whether-xrp-is-a-security-will-go-to-trial\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ripple decision<\/a> that determined that \u201Cblind bid\u201D or \u201Cprogrammatic\u201D sales of XRP to third parties did not fit all the criteria of a securities offering. The lawyers would not ask the judge to ignore the ruling if they did not believe a decision to appeal would come from the commission, which has to vote on litigation.","A different judge in the same court as the Terraform and Do Kwon case issued the Ripple decision, which would be considered precedent relevant to the case unless the SEC appeals the decision.","The part of the Ripple decision that went against the SEC\u2019s stance that XRP sales were illegal securities offerings was brought into the already-ongoing civil enforcement case by lawyers for Terraform and Kwon, who argued in a filing on Tuesday that the case against them should be dismissed as a result of the Ripple decision, which they describe as \u201Cfatal\u201D to the SEC\u2019s argument against them.","The SEC has made similar arguments that the sales of those tokens were illegal, though they also accuse Terraform and Kwon of $40 billion worth of outright fraud, an allegation not made in the Ripple case.","But SEC lawyers previewed their argument to overturn the portion of the Ripple decision that went against them, if the bipartisan commission approves an appeal, as it likely will.","The judge in the Ripple case \u201Ccorrectly concludes that defendants\u2019 extensive public statements promoting XRP created in institutional buyers reasonable expectations of profits from Ripple\u2019s efforts,\u201D SEC lawyers wrote the court in their ongoing Terraform proceedings. But they argued that \u201Cthe same result should have followed directly with respect to retail buyers too. Instead, Ripple creates an artificial distinction between the expectations of sophisticated institutional and retail investors, improperly transforms Howey\u2019s reasonable investor inquiry into a subjective one, and turns on its head the reasoning underlying Howey and other cases.\u201D","The lawyers added that the Ripple decision \u201Cappears to improperly add\u201D a requirement that promise of return be made directly to an investor, and that each investor know that their money \u201Cwas going directly to the promotor.\u201D The decision takes an unusually narrow read on what normally defines a security investment, the lawyers argued.d&nbsp;&nbsp;","Finally, the lawyers argued that courts typically lean toward interpreting existing law in ways that accentuate protection of everyday investors, the ones who ultimately bought XRP in the process that last week\u2019s split decision ruled was not a securities law violation. &nbsp;","\u201CWhen distinguishing between classes of investors, courts construe the federal securities laws\u2019 provisions to provide more \u2014 not less \u2014 protection to retail investors,\u201D the SEC lawyers wrote.","If or when an appeal comes in the Ripple case, it would go to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.","Â© 2023 The Block.
