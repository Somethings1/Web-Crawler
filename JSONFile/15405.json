Every person receives depends on how early in the project\u2019s roll-out they got involved and is distributed over two years, with 10% available immediately in a wallet app generated by the Orb.","3AC participated in a $25 million round for Worldcoin\u2019s developer Tools For Humanity, which valued the firm at a $1 billion valuation, data from funding tracker Dealroom shows. The firm\u2019s exact WLD holdings are unknown, and its founders owe creditors over $1.5 billion from investment losses, as per court filings.","Another creditor group that could likely benefit is the FTX estate. In its Series A in October 2021, Worldcoin also received investment from Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the founder and CEO of crypto exchange FTX, which has since gone bankrupt with Bankman-Fried facing allegations of fraud.","Data tracked by SpotOnChain shows wallets linked to Bankman-Fried\u2019s company received over $185 million worth of WLD tokens in August 2023. The same Worldcoin address also sent tokens worth between $35 million to $170 million to several other addresses in the same month, blockchain transactional history shows.","WLD\u2019s rise has apparently come after AI developer OpenAI\u2019s launch of a text-to-video generator, Sora, last week. Worldcoin\u2019s parent company and OpenAI share the same founder, Sam Altman, and crypto traders are likely considering WLD a bet on the latter\u2019s successes.","The token\u2019s nearly 50% jump in the past 24 hours has propelled prices to all-time highs of over $7 as of Monday, giving Worldcoin a full diluted valuation of a mammoth $75 billion.","At launch and for 15 years, a total of 10 billion WLD will be released to the market. Tokens allotted to investors and the development team were locked for a year.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"August 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"50%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Worldcoin","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Su Zhu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Feb.26","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$7","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$25 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"crypto exchange FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$35 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$185 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$1.5 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$170 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Sam Altman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"200%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$165 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Sora","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SpotOnChain","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$75 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["worldcoin","Trading","Markets","Three Arrows Capital","FTX"],"authors":["Shaurya Malwa"]}
