Existing investors Paradigm, Index Ventures and Creandum also participated, alongside new strategic backers Starkware, Jump Crypto and Animoca Brands.","The money will be used to accelerate Argent\u2019s plans to support a wider spectrum of activities across DeFi and web3.","\u201CArgent still feels very finance-centric, and we want to play a big role in other NFT verticals \u2014 so NFT gaming, virtual real estate,\u201D co-founder and CEO Itamar Lesuisse said in an interview with The Block. \u201CWe want to be the de facto wallet for gaming.\u201D","Fulfilling that vision will involve rolling out new functionality for crypto games, such as infrastructure for onboarding new players and signing in-game transactions.","Currently, Argent users are able to store certain non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within their wallets through connections to marketplaces like OpenSea.&nbsp;","Proceeds from the raise will also be used to build out Argent\u2019s services in Latin America, beginning in Mexico, where Lesuisse sees strong demand for the product. Some money will also go towards hiring in-house legal, finance and treasury management experts, as well as for a new research team focused on Layer 2 protocols, according to Lesuisse.","Founded in 2017, Argent resembles a fintech \"smart wallet\" app but built for DeFi \u2014 allowing users to buy, store and send crypto. Argent says its app has had more than 500,000 sign-ups.","In March, the startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/136501\/defi-wallet-argent-launches-layer-2-account-with-waitlist-over-500000\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">officially launched<\/a> a new version of its crypto wallet built on zkSync, an Ethereum-focused scaling solution, with the broad aim of cutting the cost and environmental impact of interacting with DeFi.","Argent has also built a wallet named Argent X on rival Ethereum-scaling solution StarkNet, which is the reason Lesuisse described Starkware\u2019s participation in the Series B round as strategic. \u201CWe are doing a massive push on StarkNet and their permissionless network with Argent X,\u201D he added. &nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
