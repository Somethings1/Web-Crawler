As such, the proposal focused on selling only half of its unstaked ETH to build up its stablecoin reserves. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At the same time, the proposal asked the DAO not to sell any of its own LDO governance tokens as that would put \u201Cunnecessary price pressure\u201D on its price.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It's not clear yet whether this proposal will be put to an on-chain vote or whether it will be approved in the end. Having said that, it does indicate Lido's willingness to reduce exposure to ETH and to play it safe in case of a drawn-out bear market. But it's already quite late; the price of ETH is down 48% this year alone.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
