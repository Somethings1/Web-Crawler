These NFTs were sold with a starting price of 2 ether, which would drop over time during the dutch auction. Yet following the sale they opened with a floor price of just 1.6 ether ($3,100) \u2014 which has now fallen to 0.84 ether ($1,600).","As a result, NFT holders are down around 11 ether ($21,600) for each of their main NFTs and 1.15 ether ($2,250) for each NFT they bought in the recent sale. Unsurprisingly, the community has been quite frustrated.","\u201CThe whales and OG made their disappointment very clear to the team, just not going public to vent their frustration.

The project has brought in 17,340 ether ($34 million) in all-time royalties, according to Nansen.","While these royalties were largely from OpenSea, they now come in primarily through Blur. That said, the effective royalty rate dropped toward the end of 2022 and royalties have considerably decreased in volume.","Azuki, however, isn\u2019t laughing all the way to the bank.
