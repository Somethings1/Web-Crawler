Asteroid uses Cosmos transaction call data for inscribing new tokens into existence called \u201CCFT-20s.\u201D","Asteroid contributors released the first CFT-20 token, <a href=\"https:\/\/asteroidprotocol.io\/app\/tokens\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Asteroids (ROIDS)<\/a>, as a proof of concept on Tuesday. The token \u2014 with a total supply of 100 million \u2014 was inscribed quickly by users within a few hours. Each ROIDS token is trading at $0.045, giving it a $4.5 million market capitalization at the time of writing.","According to Delphi Labs, Cosmos inscriptions via Asteroid open doors for various applications beyond tokenization and into data storage. It also provides a \u201Cmetaprotocol\u201D framework that can allow additional apps to be developed.","\u201CThe biggest thing people are missing with Asteroid is that it is designed to be a generalized metaprotocol framework,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lukedelphi\/status\/1747611968041607492\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> Delphi Labs CTO Luke Saunders. \u201CImages and tokens are just the first two use cases, but much more is possible.\u201D","In addition to Asteroid, Delphi Labs backs two DeFi platforms \u2014 Astroport and Mars Protocol \u2014 within the Cosmos ecosystem.","Inscriptions were introduced in early 2023 with the Ordinal protocol, which allows users to inscribe data \u2014 such as NFTs and images \u2014 onto individual satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain.","Over the second half of 2023, inscriptions rapidly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266272\/brc-20-style-tokens-are-spreading-to-chains-beyond-bitcoin-but-why\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">expanded<\/a> to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains like BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Fantom.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
