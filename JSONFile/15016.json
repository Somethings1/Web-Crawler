It\u2019s been spent talking with hordes of members from his play-to-earn gaming community, whom he\u2019s met while traveling around the country from Baguio to Cebu City.","Still hours from his home in Nueva Ecija, Spraky (the name he goes by in Web3) has been hosting gaming tournaments and meetups for the locals in these areas who\u2019ve joined Yield Guild Games (YGG). Their aim is to become part of a larger community that\u2019s learning the ins and outs of crypto by playing video games.","This article is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.","\u201CWe\u2019re planning to do this every month in different major cities here in the Philippines,\u201D he said. And even though it\u2019s temporarily cost him his voice, it\u2019s a part of his job he really loves. He\u2019s one of those lucky guys who genuinely enjoys hanging out with the people he works with. \u201CWe\u2019re staying in our community because we love our community. We love to hang out with everyone.\u201D","Spraky, a former head of engineering at his local water utilities plant, quit that job for his many side hustles after he first discovered blockchain gaming around November 2020. He\u2019s now a guild relations manager for the Philippines at YGG, a sprawling organization that owns non-fungible token (NFT) assets in games including Axie Infinity, CyBall and Fancy Birds.","YGG lends those assets out to players who can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t care to buy them \u2013 so they can still play-to-earn in the games \u2013 and takes a 20% cut for community managers and 10% for YGG overall. The remaining 70% goes to the players.","Spraky describes YGG as a \u201Cguild of guilds,\u201D or a \u201CDAO of DAOs.\u201D In other words, it\u2019s a large organization of play-to-earners (with about 30,000 current members in 28 countries around the world) that\u2019s split up into numerous subguilds. Spraky manages \u201Call of the subguilds inside YGG Philippines,\u201D yet another larger subguild within the wider YGG universe. This means the bulk of his job entails him talking to and socializing with his community members, whether via Discord or IRL meetups, like those he\u2019s been hosting this past week.","Like many others who\u2019ve played-to-earn in the Philippines, Spraky first got into Web3 by playing Axie Infinity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns across the country were especially strict, with many stuck at home or within a several-block radius \u2013 a particular problem for many in the Philippines who either work outside of the country for better financial opportunities or rely on family members who do. As of August 2020, unemployment in the country had reached a high of 17.7%.","Read more: \u2018I Don't Follow Trends\u2019: Multicoin\u2019s Kyle Samani on How to Make It in Crypto","\u201CA lot of people lost their jobs,\u201D Spraky said. \u201CSo how they put food on the table was by playing [Axie Infinity].\u201D","Spraky first encountered the Axies on Facebook \u2013 he came across a picture of someone playing the game, sparking his curiosity and an ensuing Google search. It led him to this very publication, where CoinDesk contributor Leah Callon-Butler had written an article about how people in Spraky\u2019s very own Nueva Ecija were earning money by buying, breeding, battling and trading these little NFT-backed, blobby creatures that don\u2019t quite resemble the amphibians (Axolotls) for which they\u2019re named. Rather, they each have a set of unique, whimsical traits (like pumpkin-shaped fins and thorny caterpillar tails) that can make them more or less rare \u2013 which in the NFT world tends to translate directly to value. All kinds of people in Nueva Ecija had begun playing the game to both earn much-needed income and distract themselves during the economic devastation and isolation brought on by the pandemic, selling the assets they earned in the game in exchange for cryptocurrency, which they then turned into their local pesos.","This had been going on about 20 minutes from Spraky\u2019s home in a more rural part of Nueva Ecija, but once Spraky learned about the game, he immediately \u201Cbecame really active within the Axie community,\u201D he said. His playing-to-earn eventually translated to a full-time gig.","\u201CI didn\u2019t know anything about crypto back then,\u201D Spraky admits, but he was welcomed into its sphere in part by the Filipino GameFi influencer Kookoo Crypto TV, who Spraky says invited him to join the YGG community. Spraky started spreading the word in his IRL community about the ability to earn via Axies \u2013 a somewhat tough sell, since a group of people in his area had been known to use crypto to scam others back during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017. But he and two friends cofounded Axie University (which YGG eventually helped scale due to the demand) to help communicate that this was different.","\u201CAs the community builders in our area, it's our job to introduce to [people] how to play Axie and how many opportunities can come [from that],\u201D he said.","Today, Spraky does this by waking up and immediately hopping on Discord to check messages from his YGG community members. He uses the platform to chat with his team about how to support other managers in their network, checking in on YGG\u2019s in-game NFT inventory and hosting events where play-to-earners can come to learn strategy and hang out virtually with one another.","At YGG, the lending of in-game blockchain assets is known as \u201Cscholarships,\u201D and recipients are \u201Cscholars.\u201D During the crypto bull market, when Spraky first got into his role, finding and retaining scholars was easy and enjoyable \u2013 Spraky did it for free on YGG\u2019s behalf for months until he was officially hired this past December. There was plenty of buzz around the profitability of the play-to-earn grind, and it netted real profits for many, particularly in the Philippines. People would come to him, messaging him and his team members to figure out how they could get in on the windfall.","During the bear market, like most other crypto assets, the value of in-game NFTs like Axies has tanked, so joining a play-to-earn guild doesn\u2019t have quite the same appeal. Instead of expanding the community, Spraky\u2019s been working on keeping members \u201Cengaged\u201D with events including bingo nights, singing contests and giveaways \u2013 it serves to keep up the community\u2019s spirits and display how there are perks to being involved other than the earning potential. \u201CIt's not just about how much you earn,\u201D Spraky says. \u201CIt's about how we have each other in our community.\u201D","He also reminds scholars not to consider playing-to-earn as their primary source of income, and he walks the walk. Spraky\u2019s many gigs span the virtual and physical worlds \u2013 he has a car paint shop with his family, buys NFTs, does crypto staking and participates in liquidity pools. (Though there was some reporting on people in places like the Philippines who were able to buy two houses during the earlier days of the pandemic purely from their play-to-earn income, Spraky notes that many of those people\u2019s stories were more nuanced \u2013 they were also yield farming, staking and investing in tokens that ended up taking off.)","Instead, Spraky aims to emphasize the opportunities that learning about crypto through play-to-earn can bring. \u201CWe turn our scholars into investors,\u201D he said, adding that some have even gotten jobs at other Web3 companies because of their experience playing blockchain-based games. Another strategy these days is to encourage players to buy up in-game assets while they\u2019re cheap.","\u201CAt the end of the day, we're playing a game,\u201D Spraky said. \u201CGames were meant to be played to have fun, so we always tell our scholars that we\u2019re playing this because we love the game.\u201D","What Spraky really loves, though, is Web3 at large and the community of people he\u2019s gotten to join because of it.","\u201CWe're staying here because the environment in Web3 is very different from a traditional corporate job,\u201D he said. For example, he explains how YGG is helping MetaGoons, another Web3 gaming organization that\u2019s essentially their competitor, because the Web3 ethos, as far as he\u2019s experienced it, is about \u201Cpromoting collaboration and healthy competition.\u201D","\u201CIt's really like I'm not working,\u201D Spraky added, \u201CI didn't know crypto like, two years ago\u2026 [now] I really love being here in this space.\u201D","The Crypto Jobs Boom","It may be a bear market, but there are still plenty of jobs to be had at crypto companies.","'We're Freaking DAOing It': The People Who Think DAOs Are the Future of Work","Meet the pioneers who work at decentralized autonomous organizations.","Chase Chapman on DAOs and Professional Polyamory","\"There's a lot of value in talent that doesn't want to be held down by one organization,\u201D Orca Protocol\u2019s Chase Chapman says.","Payroll, Web3 and the $62B Opportunity","Crypto can make it faster and cheaper to pay workers.","You\u2019re Hiring Wrong: Do It More Like Web3","By adopting a more open, fluid model, traditional firms would find it easier to attract talent and end up with a more passionate, engaged workforce.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"Leah Callon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"70%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"August 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Butler","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"10%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Google","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Cebu City","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"late June","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Spraky","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NFT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chapman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"November 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Axie University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Yield Guild Games","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"17.7%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"19","content":"DATE"},{"type":"end of the day","content":"TIME"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nueva Ecija","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"the Philippines","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Infinity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$62B Opportunity","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Spraky","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Kyle Samani","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Spraky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Baguio","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"YGG Philippines","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Future of Work Week","Interview"],"authors":["Jessica Klein"]}
