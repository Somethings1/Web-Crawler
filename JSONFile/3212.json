The new comments come just three days <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/106730\/india-rbi-crypto-clarification-customer-due-diligence\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">after the RBI issued a circular<\/a> asking banks not to refer to its old 2018 ban circular when dealing with crypto clients.","\"It came to our surprise that some banks were still referring to and citing that old circular in their correspondence with their customers,\u201D said Das. \"We had to set the record straight that that particular circular of RBI has been set aside. So, therefore, it is not at all correct to refer to that circular.\"","In April 2018, the RBI had passed a rule that restricted banks and other financial institutions from dealing with crypto clients, but the Supreme Court <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/57708\/indias-supreme-court-strikes-down-rbis-banking-ban-against-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">overturned<\/a> that rule last year. Still, some major banks, including HDFC Bank, were citing the old circular, warning customers of restrictions. Earlier this week, HDFC Bank reportedly <a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/markets\/cryptocurrency\/hdfc-bank-retracts-crypto-warning-after-rbis-may-31-circular\/articleshow\/83222562.cms\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">redacted<\/a> its warning.","As for whether Indians should invest in crypto, Das today said the RBI doesn\u2019t give any investment advice. \"It is for each investor to make his own appraisal, to do his own due diligence, and take a very careful call with regard to his own investments,\" said Das.","As The Block has reported previously, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/9004\/bbva-backed-fintech-firm-invests-in-indian-mutual-fund-platform-groww\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">India<\/a>'s crypto fate depends on the country's central government. The government is likely to discuss a bill in the upcoming session of parliament, which seeks to \"prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.\" The definition of private cryptocurrencies and the bill's other contents, however, are not yet public.&nbsp;","Meanwhile, Indian crypto exchange operators&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/97559\/indias-crypto-exchanges-optimistic-reports-crypto-ban\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">remain optimistic<\/a> that the government will not ban crypto and rather regulate it as an asset class."],"hashtag":[]}
