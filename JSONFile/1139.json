These include source code, development plans, and \"information explaining the launch&nbsp;and supply process, including the number of tokens to be issued in an initial allocation, the total number of tokens to be created, the release schedule for the tokens, and the total number of tokens outstanding.\"","Development teams looking to use the safe harbor would also have to file exit reports demonstrating sufficient decentralization.&nbsp;","The safe harbor is the statutory version of a longstanding proposal from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/101553\/sec-peirce-token-safe-harbor-update\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Securities and Exchange Commission's Hester Peirce<\/a>. Following the initial coin offering boom of 2017-2018, the SEC stepped up its scrutiny of token issuance, establishing an expectation that issuers register their offerings with the commission.","Based on comments from SEC leadership, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/109661\/andreessen-horowitz-new-crypto-vc-hires\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">especially Bill Hinman<\/a>, many crypto development teams still saw a route to turn centralized offerings of tokens into decentralized networks that no longer need to register with the SEC, either as an issuer or under an exemption.&nbsp;","While Peirce's framework has not picked up steam within the SEC, law passing in Congress can change all of that. The leadership of leading industry advocates the Blockchain Association, Coin Center and the Association for Digital Asset Markets noted their support for McHenry's bill.","The bill comes just half an hour before the Financial Services Committee's hearing with SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. Also this morning, Representative McHenry released a <a href=\"https:\/\/republicans-financialservices.house.gov\/uploadedfiles\/2021-10-5_letter_to_chair_gensler.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">letter<\/a> to Gensler, which said \"You have made a series of concerning and apparently self-contradicting public statements regarding crypto assets and other innovative technologies.\"","In the letter, McHenry requested answers to a series of questions on the SEC's work with crypto, particularly its expectations for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/117651\/elizabeth-warren-and-gary-gensler-place-coinbase-in-oversight-crosshairs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cryptocurrency exchanges<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/119475\/circle-continues-to-face-investigation-from-secs-division-of-enforcement-filing-states\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stablecoins<\/a>.

While many bills looking to clarify cryptocurrency regulation have been introduced \u2014 in the Financial Services Committee and elsewhere \u2014 most have languished.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["CONGRESS","GARY GENSLER","HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE","SEC"]}
