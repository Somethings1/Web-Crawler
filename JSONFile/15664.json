In this case, 3AC lawyers said Tuesday that the company made as much as $270 million in such payments to BlockFi \u2013 more than was previously disclosed.","The dispute over the money is expected to turn upon an answer to a key legal question: When was 3AC actually insolvent, and how does that date relate to when the hedge fund\u2019s payments were made?","Tensions were apparent between the sides in court, as a lawyer for BlockFi said 3AC has a \u201Crunaway\u201D legal counsel who is dragging things out and piling up more than $16 million in legal bills. A lawyer for the hedge fund, Adam Goldberg from the firm Latham & Watkins, said those comments were \u201Ccompletely inappropriate and reckless.\u201D He reminded the court that at 3AC \u201Cthe founders fled and completely ignored any attempt to engage with them,\u201D and those taking down the firm had to rebuild its records, find its assets and secure them for creditors.","Sandali Handagama contributed reporting.","Read More: Bankrupt Crypto Lender BlockFi Inches Closer to Refunding Clients","\n","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"U.S. Bankruptcy Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"January","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$284 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Michael Kaplan","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Latham & Watkins","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Adam Goldberg","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"District of New Jersey","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$270 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$16 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Feb. 5","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Three Arrows Capital","3AC","Bankruptcy","litigation","BlockFi"],"authors":["Jesse Hamilton"]}
