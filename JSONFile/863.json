Yet when the lender <span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/157491\/crypto-lender-celsius-declares-chapter-11-bankruptcy-in-new-york\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last July, <\/span>it reported a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet.","And while the 2022 crypto bear market piled pressure on Celsius's finances, the trouble had begun as early as 2020.","By June of 2021, at the height of the bull market, a third of Celsius\u2019s institutional loan portfolio was wholly unsecured and more than half was under-collateralized, the bankruptcy examiner said. The firm also recognized $800 million in losses in 2021 from investments with Grayscale, KeyFi, Stakehound and Equities First Holdings. It did not report these losses to its customers when they were incurred, the report said.","Celsius also used customer funds of bitcoin and ether to purchase its own native token CEL, according to the report, which also accused Celsius of concealing the extent to which it was market-making for CEL.","The lender used a strategy called the \u201COTC flywheel,\u201D where it would sell CEL tokens in private, over-the-counter transactions and make offsetting purchases in the public market, which it believed would impact the trading price.","Celsius employees routinely discussed in 2022 that the tokens were \u201Cworthless\u201D and questioned why any company other than Celsius was buying them.","\u201CThese trades caused Celsius\u2019s former chief financial officer to write \u2018[w]e are talking about becoming a regulated entity and we are doing something possibly illegal and definitely not compliant,'\u201D the report said.","<span class=\"TextRun SCXW130408849 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-US\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW130408849 BCX0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIf anyone ever found out our position and how much our founders took in USD could be a very&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed SCXW130408849 BCX0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">very<\/span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW130408849 BCX0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> bad look...

Between 2018 and the firm\u2019s collapse, Mashinsky sold CEL tokens for at least $68.7 million while making \"repeated assertions that he was not a seller,\" Pillay wrote.","The firm also used equity raised from outside investors to the support the price of CEL, a practice that raised concern among some managers who said the money would have been better used to grow the company.","Another manager put it more bluntly \u201CWe spent all our cash paying execs and trying to prop up alexs [sic] net worth in CEL token,\u201D a reference to Mashinsky, who earlier this month was sued for fraud by the New York Attorney General.","In another documented instance, Celsius used customer assets to purchase tokens needed to cover the liabilities of other customers. This was described as \"very Ponzi like\" by the firm\u2019s coin deployment specialist in April last year.&nbsp;","\"If Celsius had not instituted the pause and the run on the bank continued, new customer deposits inevitably would have become the only liquid source of coins for Celsius to fund withdrawals,\" said Pillay, who had been asked specifically to examine whether Celsius was running a Ponzi scheme, where existing investors' returns are paid from new clients' funds.&nbsp;","The pause appeared to satisfy the withdrawal requests, the report said. However, there were some cases in June 2022 where Celsius did directly use new customer deposits to fund customer withdrawal requests, according report.","\"The Examiner\u2019s identification of the instances where Celsius directly used new customer deposits to fund customer withdrawals is not a comprehensive or exhaustive list of all transactions for all time periods,\" Pillay said.","Bankruptcy examiners provide the courts and creditors with an independent legal outlook on the failures of a bankrupt company.","Celsius didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
