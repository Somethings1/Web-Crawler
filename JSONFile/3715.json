Coinbase, how about first year law school in 30 seconds? Sounds like fun, doesn\u2019t it? If you already finished law school you can skip ahead of course (or read so you can accuse me of over-simplifying several hundred years of jurisprudence).","Most first year law students in the United States take at least one contract law class and one tort law class. Tort and contract law are two fundamental building blocks of the legal system. They help define the legal obligations that people have to one another. In a very (VERY) broad brush fashion, you can distinguish between the two by saying that contracts are agreements between parties to perform obligations in exchange for some kind of \u201Cconsideration\u201D (money, for example). You don\u2019t have a contractual duty to someone unless you enter into a contract. And the nice thing about contracts is that if you know what you are doing you can limit your liability to your counter-party.","Torts are a different animal. They are a category of causes of action that are implied or imposed by law, even where there is no contract. I have a feeling some law professor somewhere is going to quibble with that definition, so let me give an example. If I agree to cut your grass for 10 dollars a week and you agree to pay me 10 dollars, that\u2019s a basic contract. (Yes, I am simplifying, I know, I know). But I didn\u2019t have a duty to you to cut your grass a priori, right? Nor you to pay me 10 dollars for doing so. The reciprocal duties are created by a contract. A tort duty is something different and can be quite a bit more \u2026 mushy (a term of art, that). If I shovel my sidewalk, for example, and do a terrible job and you slip and fall on my negligently shoveled sidewalk, you might sue me for negligence (I\u2019ll win, I\u2019m sure, because you were obviously careless). I don\u2019t have a contract with you, as a stranger, to shovel my own darn sidewalk. But courts have said that we have a duty to use reasonable care to prevent harm to foreseeable plaintiffs. And if the breach of that duty causes harm, whelp, you can sue for negligence. There are plenty of other torts besides negligence, by the way, but that\u2019s a for example for you.","Contracts take a lot of forms. Website terms of services are an example, and that gets us back from first-year law school to the <a class=\"cj cf mc md me mf\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/421054454\/Berk-v-Coinbase\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Berk v. Coinbase<\/a> case. We first wrote about this one back in CCM in October and you can read a summary of the facts there. In short, this case has to do with the launch of Bitcoin Cash and its availability to Coinbase customers.","Coinbase previously asked the Court to require the parties arbitrate this dispute, based on an arbitration clause in their online terms of service. Coinbase asked again and the Court said no dice. The general rule in the 9th Circuit (which is where this case is being litigated) is that an arbitration clause that applies to all disputes \u201Carising under\u201D the parties\u2019 agreement is interpreted narrowly, and only applies to claims that \u201Crefer to disputes or controversies relating to the interpretation and performance of the contract itself.\u201D Those claims by plaintiffs that were \u201Cpremised on Coinbase\u2019s alleged facilitation of insider trading or alleged market manipulation\u201D did not arise under the Coinbase terms of service, according to the Court, so the arbitration clause didn\u2019t apply. So too is the plaintiff\u2019s theory that \u201Cthat Coinbase negligently launched a dysfunctional trading market for Bitcoin Cash.\u201D The Court says this is \u201Ctoo collateral\u201D to the user agreement. So the arbitration clause didn\u2019t apply.","The Court then analyzed a motion to dismiss the negligence claims that Coinbase filed. Coinbase cited something called the economic loss rule, which says that \u201Cone does not possess a duty to exercise reasonable care against the economic loss of others.\u201D The court rejected Coinbase\u2019s argument and held that under California law it believed that","that Coinbase indeed had a duty to maintain a functional marketplace. First, Coinbase encouraged traders to enter the market following its launch of trading in Bitcoin Cash, so Coinbase\u2019s actions were aimed at the traders as a class. Second, the negligent launch of a digital currency foreseeably impacts those who trade in the resulting dysfunctional market. Third, the buyers suffered an ascertainable pocketbook injury, and fourth, that injury is directly tied to the allegedly negligent launch. As to the fifth and sixth factors, California cases suggest that the defendant\u2019s conduct is morally blameworthy, and a policy of preventing future harm is warranted, when the defendant holds a position of trust, such as Coinbase\u2019s role in processing the transactions of traders on its exchange.","The Court said that for purposes of analyzing the motion to dismiss, in which the facts must be taken as true,","the complaint also lays out a plausible account that Coinbase breached its duty to maintain a functional market. For starters, the fact that Coinbase halted trading within three minutes of the launch is indicative of dysfunction. The buyers have also identified precautions Coinbase could have taken to avert the massive spike in the price of Bitcoin Cash on its exchange. Most prominently, Coinbase could have announced its launch of trading in Bitcoin Cash more than an hour in advance, which would have permitted more buyers and sellers to place limit orders. That way, Coinbase could have ensured the liquidity and market capitalization needed for an orderly market. Id. Coinbase instead launched trading while only purchase orders were pending. And the buyers have alleged a plausible motive for Coinbase\u2019s seemingly rushed decision to launch under subpar conditions: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange opened trading in Bitcoin futures the day before the launch.","At the risk of being accused of being partisan \u2014 and I don\u2019t think I am, this is just the most interesting part of the case to me \u2014 a bunch of other claims against Coinbase were dismissed, including a fraud aim and a statutory unfair business act claim. But this case is important because it is precedent for the notion that an exchange has tort obligations to users that may be outside of any contractual agreement. Given the state of some exchanges over the last few years \u2014 where some have alleged that wash trading, spoofing and all manner of hijinx have been allowed to flourish \u2014 we see a court recognizing that liability can\u2019t be entirely limited by a user agreement\/click-through-terms-of-service. This means that the exchange can try its best to ring fence its liability in online terms of service but it still appears to have an independent duty in tort (at least under the facts of this case) to maintain a functional market, at least for a newly available asset.","The notion that tort law and its obligations can exist alongside of a contractual relationship isn\u2019t really anew thing, to be clear. But a court saying that a crypto exchange has a duty to maintain a functional market does sound like at least new-ish law. My suspicion is that this is important enough that Coinbase will take the issue up on appeal. This is a federal court and it\u2019s making what\u2019s known in the business as an \u201CErie guess\u201D about what the California Supreme Court would hold if presented with this issue. So it\u2019s possible it\u2019ll be reversed or modified if taken up. I don\u2019t know. At the moment, though, it\u2019s potentially significant precedent for the crypto exchange industry and a case that I\u2019d expect to see cited in other litigation involving crypto-exchanges and customer losses.","Â© 2023 The Block.
