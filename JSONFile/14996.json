Morris, filling in for Michael Casey to talk about so-called artificial intelligence, the threats it poses to the future \u2013 and how crypto could help mitigate them.","As Michael would surely agree, there are no real days off in crypto. I was reminded myself when I recently spent a long weekend at the fantastic Readercon fiction convention. Inevitably, I missed some important crypto stories, but I also got some up-close insight into another looming novelty: the existential threat that automated large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 pose to the entire internet.","You\u2019re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","That might sound hyperbolic. But at Readercon, I met Neil Clarke, founder and editor of the top-tier science fiction magazine Clarkesworld, which along with other fiction publications has become a canary in the coal mine of A.I. run amok. The rise of ChatGPT has inundated these journals with a flood of fake GPT-generated story submissions, a plague so severe Clarkesworld was forced to temporarily pause submissions this February, threatening the work and livelihoods of real authors.","\u201CI\u2019ve been calling it spam,\u201D says Clarke, \u201CBecause that\u2019s what it is. I sometimes refuse to even call it \u2018artificial intelligence.\u2019 You can\u2019t humanize these things. It\u2019s not like the science fiction of movies where it\u2019s aware. It\u2019s a statistical [language] model.\u201D","The mention of spam should raise the antenna of longtime cryptocurrency watchers: the same problem lay at the very origins of Bitcoin.","Between 1998 and 2002, computer scientist Adam Back developed the concept of \u201CHashcash,\u201D primarily intended to combat e-mail spam by requiring a tiny payment to send one. Back and his ideas became foundational to the development of Bitcoin, and he\u2019s now CEO of crypto developer Blockstream.","Two decades later, with robotic barbarian hordes poised to swamp human communication systems, it might be time to revisit the Hashcash concept.","\u201CChatGPT came out in late November,\u201D Clarke says, \u201CAnd we immediately started seeing submissions using it. The first people to adopt it were the ones already submitting plagiarized works. It was readily embraced by people who were trying to make a quick buck off other people\u2019s work.\u201D","As they faced down the spam problem, Clarke says he and his team quickly realized the attack was coordinated. YouTube and TikTok channels focused on get-rich-quick schemes were promising viewers they could make thousands of dollars by submitting GPT-generated stories to fiction magazines like Clarkesworld. Clarkesworld pays a few hundred dollars per story, depending on length \u2013 not much more than beer money in some parts of the world, but extremely meaningful in others.","Those fraudulent promises from online grifters seem to have spread fast. Clarke says he received 54 AI-generated submissions in December. In January, he got 117 fake stories. In February, the number hit 514 before Clarke closed submissions midday on February 20.","\u201CAnd that morning alone,\u201D he says, \u201Cwe had 50.\u201D","Clarkesworld has a small staff, who normally review about 1,100 submissions a month. So the accelerating flood of trash threatened to overwhelm them, and solutions weren\u2019t obvious.","\u201CWe have an open submission process, specifically designed to welcome in new writers and new voices,\u201D says Clarke. \u201CSo we could close submissions from certain locations [to fight spam], but we also have legitimate authors coming in from those countries. And we\u2019ve been told things like, \u2018The payment for this story will cover my bills for a month.\u2019\u201D","\u201CAuthors like that are getting buried. The A.I. submissions hurt new authors, and authors who might not be from communities that are well-connected.\u201D This is one clear way auto-generated content threatens to make the internet worse for human beings \u2013 particularly those at the margins.","\u201CIf you go back 15 or 20 years when we took submissions on paper,\u201D Clarke says, \u201Cjust the cost of postage was enough to decrease submissions from outside the U.S., Canada, and U.K. substantially. And as soon as you have digital submissions, we had this flood of international submissions.\u201D That has led to a huge diversification of the fiction world \u2013 a creative renaissance that\u2019s now threatened by the rise of LLMs.","Clarke is also a coder, which gave him useful tools for addressing the spam challenge. He began associating more metadata with submissions, such as whether they came through a VPN and the length of the user\u2019s session. These and other criteria are now used as part of a \u201Cpoints system\u201D that places stories more likely to be fake further down a review queue. This helps real authors get read first, but also ensures that every submission is eventually reviewed.","Finally, if a story is determined to be LLM-generated, the submitter is permanently banned from the system.","Those measures have helped Clarkesworld reopen submissions, for now \u2013 but a continued rise in the volume of spam they\u2019re dealing with would mean the solution is only temporary.","One important aspect of Clarke\u2019s experience is that the actual quality of the robotic submissions has been abysmally low. They\u2019re almost instantly recognizable to a human reader, and have no actual chance of being published.","\u201CChatGPT3 was writing at a level below the worst human writers,\u201D says Clarke, who after two decades as an editor knows exactly what the worst looks like. \u201CGPT4 is getting closer to the worst human writers, but even that\u2019s still rare.\u201D","\u201CThe common thing is that they have perfect grammar, they have perfect spelling,\u201D Clarke continues. \u201CBut the stories themselves don\u2019t make a lot of sense. They jump over important things. They\u2019ll start out with a basic premise, like ecological collapse, and introduce some scientists who can solve the problem, and then suddenly they\u2019ve solved the problem. It\u2019s missing the middle of the story, and bookending it with stereotypical openings and closings, done very poorly.\u201D","That sounds a lot like Ted Chiang\u2019s recent characterization of ChatGPT\u2019s output as \u201Ca blurry JPEG of the internet.\u201D This manifest crappiness happily debunks much of the brain-dead hype around LLMs. But it also makes the image of talented (and wildly underpaid) editors being forced to sift through the dross all the more depressing.","Another option for reducing spam submissions is a submission fee. Clarke says he has no desire or plan to implement a fee, thanks to overriding ethical and creative concerns. In particular, a submission fee could limit access, which the community of science fiction writers strongly opposes.","But beyond that, the technical shortcomings of current global payments infrastructure also make charging an anti-spam fee impractical, even if Clarke wanted to.","For instance, Clarke says to charge a submission fee, he would need to be able to refund it, for instance to writers whose stories were accepted, or simply not AI-generated. An ideal spam-blocking fee would also be quite small \u2013 certainly far lower than the $25 or $30 worth of postage that was keeping away developing-world authors in the pre-internet era.","But there\u2019s no way to do that with current tech.","\u201CTell me a credit card company where I can refund almost all of it. I\u2019d lose the account,\u201D says Clarke. As any good crypto bro knows, credit cards also don\u2019t play well with small payments. But those aren\u2019t even the biggest issue.","\u201CThere are also problems with trying to take payments in different parts of the world,\u201D Clarke continues. \u201CThere are a number of African countries that credit card companies won\u2019t work with. So that would eliminate authors. I\u2019ve also had people suggest identity services, but those also have nation-sized holes in them. We need something that works for everybody.\u201D","If you\u2019re reading this, you already know where we\u2019re headed: at least in principle, cryptocurrency and related systems could help mitigate Clarkesworld\u2019s fake submission problem.","Requiring a small payment for all submissions would reduce low-quality submissions, lightening editors\u2019 workloads, and compensating them for the spam that did come in. Because payments could be cheaply, quickly, and easily returned to real authors, the cost to actual human writers would be marginal. And because these systems are not confined by national borders, no real writers would be crowded out by the robo-regurgitators.","Though it would take considerable elaboration, some version of the same system may someday serve parallel purposes in less boutique settings. One can imagine a Steem-like system of staking incentives being used to punish automated posting on forums or social media, for instance. More elaborate decentralized identity systems, such as SpruceID, are more challenging and, for now, more nascent, but could have even more profound potential.","To be clear, none of this should be necessary. LLMs are quickly being revealed as little more than parlor tricks, whose real utility is probably limited, at least in the near term, to short-form customer service and clickbait entertainment. (Take for instance CNET\u2019s disastrous experiment with using GPT to write news articles).","The technology\u2019s biggest impacts are instead seen in the spread of fourth-rate gibberish that wastes the time and brainpower of all the actual humans involved. But if this is what the god-princes of Silicon Valley see as the next frontier of venture capital riches, then it is the world we\u2019ll have to live in. At the very least, crypto offers one hope for fighting back.","Edited by Ben Schiller."],"entity":[{"type":"Canada","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$30","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Ben Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Neil Clarke","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.K.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"David Z.
