When asked for the drop out in the top 10, Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, told The Block: \u201COur new Benchmark includes a category for recent hacks for which we penalize exchanges. As Binance was recently hacked, it is marked down in the security category.\"","In May, Binance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/skeptics-lens-binance-suffered-the-sixth-largest-hack-in-history-but-it-will-take-less-than-2-months-to-earn-it-back-22478\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suffered<\/a> the sixth-largest hack in history, in which 7,070 bitcoin (worth nearly $41.2 million at the time) were stolen.

When asked for details, Hayter told The Block that Bitstamp, itBit, Coinone and Gemini are a few examples that provide a custody provider, while Gemini and Independent Reserve offer third-party insurance, among others.&nbsp;","\u201CSecurity has been a key Gemini pillar since inception and protecting our customers\u2019 cryptocurrency is a priority as we build the future of money,\" said Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, managing director of operations at Gemini, on being ranked at the top.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nNotably, top-tier exchanges (grades AA-B) account for 33% of global volumes, while lower-tier exchanges (grades C-E) account for 67% of global volumes, according to the updated rankings.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">'Thousands of research hours'<\/strong>","Hayter told The Block that the refined methodology and rankings took \u201Cthousands of research hours\u201D as the underlying data set comprises \u201Cover 300 qualitative and quantitative metrics\u201D on over 160 exchanges.&nbsp;","London-based CryptoCompare is not the only firm that ranks exchanges.
