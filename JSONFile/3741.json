Combined with the EIP-1559 feature on Ethereum, where a portion of transaction, or gas, fees are \"burned,\" it's estimated that more ether is destroyed than added to supply whenever the transaction fees go above 16 gwei, the very trend being observed now. In fact, the supply is merely 1,700 ETH away from getting to pre-Merge level and continuously going down, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/ultrasound.money\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a> from ultrasound.money.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If this trend continues, and fee burns remain greater than new issuance, we may see supply growth drop below the level prior to The Merge in the next few days, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mhonkasalo\/status\/1582853040972787712?s=46&amp;t=31DMFFOXpPPLX3f7fxPWPw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> DeFi researcher Mika Honkasalo. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Post-merge total supply change is about to turn negative in the next 5-7 days,\" Honkasalo<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mhonkasalo\/status\/1582853040972787712?s=46&amp;t=31DMFFOXpPPLX3f7fxPWPw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ETH supply change since The Merge.

The increased activity has been accounted for by the introduction of a freely claimable token called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/176923\/someone-abused-ftxs-withdrawal-fee-subsidy-to-mint-70000-of-xen\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">XEN<\/a>.
