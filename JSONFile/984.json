Now, more than a year later, it appears that investors are heeding the recommendation of the crypto asset management firm.&nbsp;","Michael Sonnenshein, a managing director at firm, said that 2020 has been a year marked by \"unprecedented capital inflows for the Grayscale business.\"","\"On the heels of 2019, which was a record year for us, the momentum has carried into 2020,\" he told The Block. \"In Q3, the firm raised over $1 billion and we are pleased to share with you that we are seeing that momentum only increase \u2014 two-thirds of the way into Q4.\"","The inflows into Grayscale's funds are striking juxtaposed with action in the gold market, according to a group of analysts at JPMorgan in a report published Friday.","\"What makes the past five weeks flow trajectory for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/23109\/inflows-into-grayscale-products-picked-up-40-in-q1-fueled-by-offshore-hedge-funds-looking-for-bitcoin-exposure\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Grayscale<\/a> Bitcoin Trust even more impressive is its contrast with the equivalent flow trajectory for gold ETFs, which saw modest outflows since mid-October,\" the analysts wrote, adding:","\"The contrasts lends support to the idea that some investors that previously invested in gold ETFs, such as family offices, may be looking at bitcoin as an alternative to gold.\"","The contrast isn't surprising to Sonnenshein, who said that Grayscale made a bet that money would rotate into bitcoin as a result of shifting preferences.&nbsp;","\"Going back to the Drop Gold campaign, we took a look at generational investment preferences and we are now seeing the beginning of this wealth transfer,\" he said.&nbsp;","Recent gold ETF outflows have been underpinned by a decline in the metal's price since midsummer.

Also, inflation \u2014 which is believed to be a tailwind for gold \u2014 appears to be less of a concern among Wall Streeters.
