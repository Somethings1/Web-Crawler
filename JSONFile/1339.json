These shards are then stored with three third-party companies. The seed phrase can only be restored if the three shards are combined on a Ledger device \u2014 and for the user to do so, they need to pass an identity verification test. The service costs $9.99 a month and if a user stops paying, they won't be able to access the backup after a certain point.","The optional service has proven <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230992\/ledger-defends-crypto-wallet-recovery-tool\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">controversial<\/a>, with many Ledger owners skeptical about the service and worried that it was a feature they weren't aware the device was capable of performing. Larchevêque noted that he had even seen users posting pictures of their Ledger devices being burned in protest of the new feature.","<span data-v-9360dbf6=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nicolas Bacca, co-founder and VP of Innovation Lab at Ledger<\/span>, claimed that the new service \"doesn't change the security assumptions compared to a firmware update.\" In an emailed response to The Block, Ledger reiterated that its an optional service \u2014 \"<span data-v-9360dbf6=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">so if you're a Ledger user who wants to use your Ledger as you always have, you can still do that without concern.
