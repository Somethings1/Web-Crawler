ASIC believes this isn\u2019t true.","\u201CWe allege that, despite what BPS represented in its marketing, Qoin merchant numbers have been declining, and that there have been periods of time where it was not possible to exchange Qoin tokens through independent exchanges,\u201D ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court said.","ASIC is also concerned that the company misrepresented its regulatory status.","\"We believe the more than 79,000 individuals and entities who have been issued with the Qoin Facility may have believed that it was compliant with financial services laws, when ASIC considers it was not,\u201D Court said.","BPS is <a href=\"https:\/\/qoin.world\/important-update\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reviewing<\/a> the allegations.","\u201CBPS does not agree with ASIC\u2019s position and, confident of its position, will be defending the matter. Before it started, BPS consulted with ASIC in late 2019 regarding the structure of the Qoin project and did so again in early 2021,\u201D it said.","The date for the first case management hearing has not yet been scheduled.","Australian regulators have been paying more attention to crypto assets recently. Earlier this month, ASIC also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177615\/australian-authority-temporarily-suspends-three-holon-investments-crypto-funds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">suspended<\/a> the offering and distributing of three cryptocurrencies to retail investors on Holon Investments for 21 days.
