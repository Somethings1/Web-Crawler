Similar to Ethereum 2.0, the network makes use of sharding, a method that breaks down the blockchain into different servers or shards. Instead of processing all network transactions, each node only processes transactions for a particular shard, allowing more transactions to move in a given time. The sharding solution is intended to help NEAR become more scalable.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In July 2019, the NEAR team <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/44552\/flux-now-enables-users-to-create-their-own-markets-that-bet-on-anything\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> $12.1million from prominent investors, including Metastable, Accomplice, Pantera, Multicoin, and Coinbase Ventures.

However, although the team envisions a community-governed network with no restrictions on the identity of the validators, NEAR's current version runs on the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) mode and only features validators controlled by the NEAR Foundation.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In July or August, there will be an update that allows validators run by existing token holders and white-listed professionals to participate in the network.
