The terms of the deal were not disclosed.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whilst the two brands will initially stay separate, the move will see MyCrypto merge with MetaMask over time, with emphasis on the latter brand in the long run.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe MyCrypto wallet is going to continue to exist and serve its current audience,\" says Dan Finlay founder of MetaMask,&nbsp; \u201CBut we're going to be putting a lot of our shared energy into the Metamask brand, because that's the product that has more users today.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For Finlay, another key reason for the acquisition is developer talent \u2014 specifically, the MyCrypto team\u2019s previous focus on user safety and security. The wallet manager's developer experience in building desktop apps will be used to further build out MetaMask\u2019s security and anti-phishing processes, create developer documentation and enable a shared team across both company\u2019s core libraries for its products.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThese are things that we've wanted to do for so long,\u201D says Finlay.\u201DWith the MyCrypto acquisition, we're finally putting ourselves over the threshold where we're going to be able to give all these things specific, dedicated focus.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","He also notes that both teams have known each other for a while, with the team collaborating since 2015 on anti-phishing campaigns and security tip knowledge bases during the ICO boom.&nbsp;","\"I've been through war with [founder of MyCrypto] Taylor Monahan,\" says Finlay. \"We've experienced the shared trauma of several market cycles, where there's been an urgency to keep our users safe.\"","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When asked if further acquisitions were in the pipeline, Finlay didn\u2019t rule out future buyouts despite it not being a core MetaMask strategy.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere are some other product software services that we have particularly good relationships with that we are open to considering [too].\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The news comes after The Block reported last week that the company that created MetaMask is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/131445\/ethereum-developer-consensys-poised-to-double-its-valuation-in-pending-fundraise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raising a primary round of $300 million<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> at a pre-money valuation of $6.7 billion.
