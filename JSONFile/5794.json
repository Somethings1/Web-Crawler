While the project is protected by multi-party computation, the servers running this were controlled by Zhaojun's personal cloud server account. As a result, when he was detained, those who would normally sign such transactions had their access revoked \u2014 hence why the project was unable to initially fix its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231974\/multichain-token-price-drops-20-as-bridge-upgrade-causes-delayed-transactions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">technical issues<\/a>.","The project noted that all operational funds and investor funds were under Zhaojun's control and are now with the Chinese police.","On June 4, Multichain team engineers managed to fix the project's technical issues after getting access via historical information on Zhaojun's home computer.","On July 7, funds were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238206\/tens-of-millions-of-dollars-withdrawn-from-multichain-on-fantom-in-possible-exploit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">moved abnormally<\/a> from the network.

Two days later, she transferred $220 million of remaining user assets \u2014 primarily stablecoins and ether \u2014 into new wallets under her control.","On July 13, Chinese police took Zhaojun's sister into custody too, the project said, and the project is unclear about the status of the assets.","\"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Due to the lack of alternative sources of information and corresponding operational funds, the team is forced to cease operations,\" it said.<\/span>","Multichain also explained that it did not disclose the information that Zhaojun was detained throughout the last few weeks due to local laws and regulations.
