Volumes hit $5.63 billion in January this year, before falling off a cliff in the summer. Less than $1 billion NFTs were traded in June, and it looks as though volumes will be lower still for July.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But Bosc, who spent nearly 10 years trading crude oil at Goldman Sachs before joining GSR last year, is undeterred. He believes the timing is in fact \u201Copportune\u201D because the prices of blue-chip NFTs have fallen so dramatically. Can he be sure, though, that they will rebound?<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI\u2019m pretty confident that they\u2019ll be back, but they might be back looking different,\u201D he said. \u201CI think NFTs will act as an even higher beta than the wider crypto market.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">His thinking is that in the event of a rebound, rising floor prices \u2014 the cheapest entry point for NFT collections \u2014 coupled with a rally in ether (the token that most NFT prices are denominated in), will give holders \u201Csquared exposure\u201D to the crypto market.

Fidenza and Chromie Squiggle are blue-chip collections from the generative art platform Art Blocks, a focal point of GSR\u2019s NFT trading efforts. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But GSR Blue \u2014 which is comprised of pieces the company intends to hold, not trade \u2014 is only the tip of the iceberg. To kickstart the market making project, GSR first had to accumulate a sizable inventory of NFTs. Bosc said that the firm has bought roughly 175 pieces so far, and sold 15 \u2014 much of the trading in Art Blocks collections. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dune.com\/0xRob\/archipelago\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">chart<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> compiled on Dune Analytics by the Twitter user 0xRob shows that GSR has been driving a lot of volume through Archipelago, a generative art marketplace founded in November last year and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nftevening.com\/new-generative-art-nft-marketplace-archipelago-backed-by-tyler-hobbs\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">backed by Fidenza creator Tyler Hobbs<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. According to the chart, GSR has bought 1,069.56 ether\u2019s worth of generative art on the platform (approximately $1.7 million), while selling NFTs worth 229.83 ether (around $371,000). GSR has also been trading on gm.studio, a decentralized art platform, according to Bosc.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OpenSea is by far and away the NFT sector\u2019s largest marketplace, dominating volumes in good months and bad. Yet GSR appears to be trading predominantly on Archipelago, a far smaller outfit with just a handful of staff. Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In part, because of the platform\u2019s focus on generative art and Art Blocks, which aligns neatly with GSR\u2019s plans. The firm\u2019s co-founder and president Rich Rosenblum told The Block in January that Art Blocks pieces are a good fit for algorithmic trading, because of the \u201Cmathematical seed\u201D that dictates their appearance. But Archipelago\u2019s more sophisticated bidding system also helped entice GSR.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThey give us the option to create bids for collection level, but also at the trait level,\u201D said Bosc. \u201CSo, if I said I want a slinky Squiggle, I could show bids to all of the slinkies.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NFT trading is still a sideshow at GSR, with just a few people dedicated to it and a few million dollars at stake. The hope, though, is that it will help foster a smoother market in which operators will always have a buyer and seller of last resort, whatever the state of crypto prices.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThis is what is missing in NFTs \u2014 just creating the conditions for trading,\u201D said Bosc. \u201CAnd that\u2019s part of the experiment.
