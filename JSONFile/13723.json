Non-custodial exchanges \u2013 that is, trading platforms that don't handle or control customer funds \u2013 appear more likely to not fall under them.&nbsp;","As the group notes:","\u201CStaff is aware that some Platform operators are of the view that the Platforms they operate are not subject to securities legislation because they only allow for transactions involving crypto assets that are not, in and of themselves, derivatives or securities. However, based on our analysis of how trading occurs on Platforms, we note that some Platforms are merely providing their users with a contractual right or claim to an underlying crypto asset, rather than immediately delivering the crypto asset to its users. In such cases, after considering all of the facts and circumstances, we have concluded that these Platforms are generally subject to securities legislation.\u201D","It\u2019s that \u201Cimmediate\u201D delivery aspect that may wind up capturing many of Canada\u2019s current exchanges. The CSA notice includes an extended discussion on the nature of immediate delivery, ultimately noting that it would consider such an event occurring if the exchange:","When reached for comment, Adam Goldman, founder and president of Canada-based Bitbuy, said that the company \"is encouraged by the CSA adding clarity to its proposed framework in March 2019.\"","\"Having a defined regulatory landscape will promote the cryptocurrency industry in Canada, and will provide platforms that seek to lawfully participate in the financial system a clear path forward, while at the same time protecting the rights of Canadians,\" he told The Block.&nbsp;","Thomas Beattie, CEO of Canadian financial services firm Voleo, told The Block that he believes \"the regulators nailed it.\"","\"If I cut to the essence of what the CSA has done here, it is continuing their mandate of protecting the public.&nbsp;Too many scams and collapses have occurred for regulators to ignore the risk that the public faces when their funds are held by platforms that don\u2019t segregate client assets or offer them appropriate protections,\" he said.","Cornell Law professor Robert Hockett told The Block that when a digital asset is not immediately delivered but stored on the exchange, there is a risk that the asset will lose its value, resulting in loss for the customers.","As such these exchanges are actually offering \u201Cthe right to something in the future\u201D that may expose investors to risk and speculation.","\u201CThey [Canandian regulators] are saying that\u2026 the distinction that really matters is a transaction where you are immediately receiving the underlying thing you are buying and a transaction where you have the right to something in the future,\u201D Hockett said, adding:","\u201CAnd because of the latter, the time-spanning commitment is inherently risk-prone and inherently speculative, and in that sense, it\u2019s a security with the meaning of the laws we use to regulate security transactions and security exchanges.\u201D","Christine Duhaime, a crypto legal expert based in Canada, described the move as \u201Ca solid move for consumer protection\u201D in comments to The Block.","\u201CI think they understand how exchanges and wallets work and are making all exchanges that take custody for any period of time of customer assets, subject to securities law, thereby eliminating any more risk to users in Canada,\u201D she said, going on to note:","\u201CBut as an operator in Canada or a US or foreign one who on-boards Canadian residents, it makes them now subject to our securities law regardless of their coins listed.\u201D","Duhaime added that there are more than a dozen regulators tied to securities oversight and that \u201Cit\u2019s complicated here to do business although they try to each work together to ease the legal work.\u201D","\u201CIt ends risky behaviour though, and finally in Canada gives exchanges a regulator,\u201D she went on to say. \u201CA place to call for guidance and to have legal certainty. The ecosystem needed that.\u201D","In 2019, Canada became ground-zero for scrutiny of crypto exchanges when QuadrigaCX <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/23014\/quadrigacx-owes-creditors-160-million-but-has-just-21-million-in-confirmed-accessible-assets-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">collapsed<\/a> following the death of its operator, Gerald Cotten. The fall of QuadrigaCX is currently the subject of investigations by U.S. and Canadian authorities.","Last November, a crypto exchange called Einstein <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/45848\/canadian-crypto-exchange-einstein-shuts-down-owes-more-than-12m-to-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shut down<\/a>, reportedly owing more than 16 million Canadian dollars to its customers.","\u201CIt might have some influence here in the U.S\u2026 because everybody is looking for guidance from everybody.\u201D","&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
