This will enable new use cases and monetization models, while allowing dapps to serve multiple chains through a single deployment.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">An example use case could be triggering a Flare smart contract action with a payment made on another chain, or with input from an Web2 API. Flare\u2019s technology can also facilitate new ways of bridging between blockchains, supporting free decentralized movement of both smart-contract and non-smart contract assets between chains.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To make this possible, Flare has developed two native interoperability protocols which enable on-chain, decentralized acquisition of blockchain, time series and Web2 API data. The protocols are secured by the network itself, with decentralized and independent data providers incentivized to deliver accurate data. This helps Flare to minimize risks for users and developers.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/flare.network\/stateconnector\/?utm_source=TDE&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=TheBlock\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">State Connector<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> securely acquires event information from other blockchains and the internet to be used in smart contracts on Flare.

Alternatively, it could be event data from a Web2 API, such as for a bank or social media platform.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It acquires this data securely, scalably and in a decentralized manner, with a set of independent attestation providers needing to come to consensus on the validity of an event before the data is made available to dapps on the network. In contrast to a proof of stake based system where data providers are obliged to stake value, the security of the State Connector is not limited by the amount staked in the system. This means that the State Connector is invariant in its safety relative to the size of a transaction, offering a secure system capable of powering higher value use cases.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The second core protocol is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/flare.network\/ftso\/?utm_source=TDE&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=TheBlock\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Flare Time Series Oracle<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> (FTSO).
