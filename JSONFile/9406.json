Luna was directly exchangeable for TerraUSD and was burned or minted in order to increase supply and demand for TerraUSD, with the intent of forcing TerraUSD\u2019s value to stay at $1 per coin. However, neither coin was actually backed by US.. dollar reserves and, eventually, investors heavily sold both luna and TerraUSD, wiping out more than $40 billion in value.","That started a chain of events in which crypto prices declined broadly and investors began exiting their crypto positions across the entire market.","\u201CIn May 2022, the prices of Terra and luna crashed by more than 99% and caused cryptocurrency to plunge, wiping out billions in value, and the industry to suffer significant losses, including for many of Celsius\u2019s institutional counterparties. One particularly impactful event for Celsius was the unexpected and extremely rapid mass withdrawals of assets from Celsius\u2019s platform, during which it lost over $672 million in assets over the course of several days,\u201D Mashinsky says in his motion.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/153013\/celsius-says-its-determined-to-find-a-resolution-a-week-after-halting-withdrawals\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Celsius paused all withdrawals<\/a> on June 12, 2022, and then filed for bankruptcy, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dlnews.com\/articles\/fintech\/best-regards-and-hodl-on-celsius-customers-fury-as-100000-in-bitcoin-trapped-in-collapsed-crypto-lender\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">leaving investors frozen out of their crypto accounts and savings<\/a>.","A source close to Mashinsky also pointed The Block to <a href=\"https:\/\/celsiusnetwork.se\/why-did-celsius-collapse-the-true-story\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a blog post attributing the downfall of Celsius<\/a> to an attack by competing firms, particularly FTX (which itself went bankrupt a few months later). That blog, written by pseudonymous Twitter user called Celhodl, argues that as customers began withdrawing their money from Celsius, the exchange realized its declining assets were now worth \u201C$1.2 billion less than what users had deposited.\u201D (<a href=\"https:\/\/ag.ny.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/mashinsky_complaint.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">New York State\u2019s complaint<\/a> claims that even though there were $20 billion in deposits before its collapse, Celsius nonetheless struggled to generate enough revenue to cover the \u201Cyield\u201D it owed customers who had deposited their crypto in interest-bearing accounts).","At the same time, FTX\u2019s sister hedge fund, Alameda Research, began shorting CEL, Celsius\u2019s native token, using its now-infamous ability to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/17\/alameda-had-secret-exemption-from-ftx-liquidation-protocols-new-ceo-says\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">borrow unlimited amounts of from the FTX platform without risk of liquidation<\/a>, the blog says. \u201CAlameda et al. had the ability to borrow millions of synthetic CELs and dump them on the market so that the price was pushed down,\u201D the blog claims.","None of this was Mashinsky\u2019s fault, his motion says. \u201CUltimately, however, circumstances outside of Mashinsky\u2019s (and Celsius\u2019s) control led to a liquidity squeeze that resulted in Celsius pausing withdrawals and filing for bankruptcy. Instead of acknowledging that Celsius\u2019s eventual downfall was caused by a series of calamitous, external events, the NYAG pins all resulting losses on the alleged misstatements on Mashinsky alone.\u201D","Mashinsky also makes a novel argument that its yield-paying \"Earn\" accounts were not securities precisely because they promised a guaranteed rate of interest to customers. One definition of a \u201Csecurity\u201D in U.S. law is any financial instrument that promises a return based on a \u201Ccommon enterprise,\u201D usually meaning the efforts of others, such as a company or cartel. Usually, interest-bearing products \u2014 like bonds \u2014 are classed as securities because they pay interest, and the interest is generated by the \u201Ccommon enterprise\u201D of whoever borrowed the money on which the interest is being paid.","Mashinsky, however, argues that Celsius gave earn account holders a guaranteed rate of interest regardless of how well Celsius\u2019 revenues performed, and thus were not related to a common enterprise. \u201CUnder the agreement, Celsius paid the Earn account holder a predetermined, published weekly interest rate based on the type and amount of digital assets the user loaned. (rates \u201Cwere \u2018subject to change on a weekly basis as they are calculated by the weekly demand for each coin . . . .\u2019\u201D). Thus \u2026 the Earn account holders\u2019 fortunes were based on a predetermined rate, and were not dependent on Celsius\u2019s revenue generation.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
