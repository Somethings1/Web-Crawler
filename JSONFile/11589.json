But generating large yields often comes with the sacrifice of taking outsized risk of losing invested assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If the market for US dollar stablecoin is 8-10% and someone else is paying 20%, investors must ask hard questions about how they can do that. When yields appear too good to be true, they usually are.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Right now, prudent lenders still see opportunities in the market where they could seek higher yield for clients. However, they\u2019re making a conscious effort to assess t<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hose opportunities and choose not to invest where the risk of losing client assets is too high<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.

Spreading the risk is a sign a potential lender is adopting a conservative approach to wealth-building, especially when others are taking larger risks.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Right now, any digital asset business issuing loans to a single counterparty is facing a great deal of \u2018concentration risk\u2019. When a borrower gets into some sort of financial trouble and is unable to repay all assets back in this scenario, lenders can soon discover the amount of cash within the company is less than the unpaid loan.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s also important to ask the types of&nbsp; borrowers your assets are being loaned to in order to generate the yield you are receiving. Some lenders, like Ledn, will only issue loans to high-quality institutions and credit-worthy borrowers that don\u2019t take a directional view of the market. Be sure any potential lender safeguards assets, through strong underwriting and ongoing monitoring of counterparties.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Above all, seek out comfort about the return <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">of <\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the assets, not just the promised return <\/span><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> those assets.

Borrowers can be assured a lender is engaged in responsible risk management if the assets remain secure, and they can be pulled back from that institution whenever they are needed.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Risk and reward trade-offs will always drive an investor\u2019s decision-making when pursuing long-term goals like growing generational wealth. But to generate yield, risks need to be relative to the market environment. And the assets need to remain accessible \u2014\u202Falways.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by&nbsp;Ledn and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
