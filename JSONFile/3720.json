On another occasion, the creator of a yield farm held funds hostage in a scam that cost Alameda $40 million, said Baradwaj.","In his last example, Baradwaj said that, after the leaking of an older version of the Alameda's \"plaintext keys file,\" an attacker was able to transfer funds \"out of some exchanges and placed bad orders,\" resulting in a loss of $50 million.","Baradwaj has said he lost more than 90% of his liquid assets when FTX collapsed.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
