Some combination of multiple techniques allowed the hacker(s) to send themselves a single giant transaction of &gt;7,000 BTC to an address under their control, from the Binance hot wallet. Binance announced that this would be 100% covered from their insurance fund, and that no user funds would be affected.","Jeremy Rubin, a BTC core dev and friend-of-the-newsletter had the following suggestion","<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cz_binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@cz_binance<\/a> if you reveal your private keys for the hacked coins (or a subset of them) you can decentralized-ly at zero cost to you, coordinate a reorg to undo the theft.","You can replace \u201Creveal the private keys\u201D (which would allow miners to make their own transactions spending the hacker\u2019s coins to miner addresses) with \u201Ccreate a double-spend of the hack transaction back to a Binance-controlled wallet, and add a massive fee\u2014700 BTC? 7000 BTC?\u2014to incent miners to reorg the chain to reflect the Binance transaction rather than the hacker\u2019s transaction.\u201D","This suggestion was made when roughly 50 blocks had elapsed, so what Jeremy was suggesting would require a massive amount of hashpower to pull off. It\u2019s also not a new suggestion (the wonderful Bitmex Research pointed to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/4vupa6\/p2shinfo_shows_movement_out_of_multisig_wallets\/d61qyaj\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">this thread<\/a>) and so far it\u2019s never actually been tried. In general, sentiment in the community was so massively against this move that it probably would have caused a chainsplit, and therefore been untenable.","However, would it be advisable for an exchange who has just been hacked and realizes it VERY rapidly to try this after only 2-3 blocks have elapsed? The bitcoin chain is reorg-ed by a few blocks occasionally in the course of normal mining, which is part of how the \u201Cwait 6 confirmations\u201D rule came about. If the exchange noticed the hack within 2 blocks, or even before it made it out of the mempool, and immediately submitted a competing transaction with a much higher fee, I don\u2019t think most of the community would have any problem with it. However, if exchanges started doing this frequently, they would perhaps be incentivizing <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">miners <\/em>to hack them, since the miners know that the exchange will attempt to \u201Cburn\u201D the hacked funds into fees\u2026","Anyway, this story has an uneventful and perhaps happy ending:","After speaking with various parties, including <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeremyRubin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@JeremyRubin<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_prestwich?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@_prestwich<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bcmakes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@bcmakes<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hasufl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@hasufl<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JihanWu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@JihanWu<\/a> and others, we decided NOT to pursue the re-org approach. Considerations being:","cons: 1 we may damage credibility of BTC, 2 we may cause a split in both the bitcoin network and community. Both of these damages seems to out-weight $40m revenge. 3 the hackers did demonstrate certain weak points in our design and user confusion, that was not obvious before.","So for now, this has been a koan-like lesson on the nature of Nakamoto consensus and its lack of transaction finality, but we didn\u2019t get to see how Bitcoin would behave in a particularly extreme scenario.","More next week, as always thanks for reading!","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinops.org\/en\/newsletters\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Optech<\/a>&nbsp;on Bitcoin<\/strong>","<a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoincore.org\/en\/releases\/0.18.0\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin Core 0.18.0 released<\/a>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Proposal for support of Schnorr signatures and Taproot script commitments:<\/strong>&nbsp;Pieter Wuille&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/lists.linuxfoundation.org\/pipermail\/bitcoin-dev\/2019-May\/016914.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">posted<\/a>&nbsp;to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list a proposed&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sipa\/bips\/blob\/bip-schnorr\/bip-taproot.mediawiki\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BIP for Taproot<\/a>&nbsp;(using Schnorr signatures) and a proposed&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sipa\/bips\/blob\/bip-schnorr\/bip-tapscript.mediawiki\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BIP for Tapscript<\/a>, a small variation on Bitcoin\u2019s current Script language to be used with Taproot encumbrances.","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">James from Summa<\/strong>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Summa builds tools to exchange crypto in a convenient and trustless fashion.<\/em>","We added a basic infura websocket client to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/summa-tx\/riemann-ether\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">riemann-ether<\/a>","<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/summa-tx\/bitcoin-spv\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bitcoin-spv<\/a>&nbsp;now has tools for calculating Bitcoin sighashes on-chain and verifying Bitcoin signatures, plus a better readme :)","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tony from Kadena<\/strong>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kadena is building Pact, a formally verifiable smart-contracting language for financial applications, and Chainweb, a PoW blockchain that uses multiple chains in parallel to increase throughput.<\/em>","Monica Quaintance presented Kadena\u2019s hybrid blockchain and its enterprise applications at&nbsp;<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MIT Technology Review<\/em>\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection#a1c9d5d5d1d29b8e8ec4d7c4cfd5d28fd5c4c2c9cfcecdcec6d8d3c4d7c8c4d68fc2cecc8ed7c8c5c4ce8ed6c0d5c2c98ecccecfc8c2c08cd0d4c0c8cfd5c0cfc2c48cd1c4d3ccc8d2d2c8cecfc4c58cc3cdcec2cac2c9c0c8cfd2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Business of Blockchain<\/a>&nbsp;conference.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;","Looking ahead in May, Kadena's Will Martino, Stuart Popejoy, and Monica Quaintance are speaking at Consensus and then we're aiming to release testnet v1 at the end of the month.","The Kadena team would enjoy meeting up with folks during New York Blockchain Week.
