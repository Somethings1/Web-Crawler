TVL is the total amount that has been committed or \"locked-in\" by users of various DeFi protocols.","The $2 billion milestone got achieved quicker. Just about five months ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/55212\/value-locked-into-defi-protocols-has-crossed-1-billion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TVL was about $1 billion<\/a>.

Users who lend or borrow COMP on Compound's platform can generate a yield, similar to how investors can earn a yield from a savings account. However, interest rates on Compound can fetch users a high yield, depending on the price of COMP and the strategies employed.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nNotably, MakerDAO was the leading DeFi protocol for well over a year, and now that top spot has been gained by rival Compound.
