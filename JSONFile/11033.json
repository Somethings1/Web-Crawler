It outlines a tiered token allocation system, suggesting that between 1% (100 million tokens), 1.5% (150 million) and 1.75% (175 million tokens) of the total 10 billion ARB supply be earmarked from the DAO\u2019s treasury for staking rewards. At the time of writing, the majority of voters are in favor on enabling staking for which they want allocate 1% (100 million tokens).","The proposed staking model also includes penalties for early withdrawal to encourage stakeholders to maintain their investments, thereby aligning the commitment of token holders with the ecosystem\u2019s long-term objectives.","After this temperature check voting period, the DAO is set to consider a subsequent AIP proposal that will focus on the specifics of the staking implementation and will need approval. Furthermore, a final community nod on the Tally, an on-chain DAO management platform, would be required to finally grant stakers a token yield from the treasury. This yield will be distinct from other mechanisms where tokens are staked to secure the network or to distribute revenue.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The article has been updated to specify that a subsequent vote, following the above initial one, will be held to approve the implementation of staking.<\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
