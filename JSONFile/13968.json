Nevertheless, users are advised to continue using their current deposit addresses until they receive an official notification from Binance indicating that it's time to switch to a new address and memo.","Binance reassured its users that funds deposited into expired addresses will not be lost. Instead, these deposits can be manually credited by users through the \u201Ctransaction history\u201D page on Binance.&nbsp;The new system will result in deposits made into expired addresses not being automatically credited as before. Users can obtain new deposit addresses and memos by logging into their accounts via the official Binance app or website, the exchange added.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
