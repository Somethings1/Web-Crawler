The amount of value locked in the project\u2019s smart contract has fallen to $0.47, <a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/stars-arena?denomination=USD\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according to DefiLlama<\/a>.","\u201CThere has been a major security breach with the smart contract. We're actively checking the issue. DO NOT deposit any funds,\u201D said <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/starsarenacom\/status\/1710540444075978846\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Stars Arena on X<\/a>.","The vulnerability was caused by a reentrancy issue, PeckShield said, which allowed attackers to sell tickets for much more than they were worth, up to $2,740 each.","The app\u2019s users are still able to withdraw tokens they have in their wallets on the app but will not receive any value if they sell tickets \u2014 which represent access to other people\u2019s chat groups \u2014 that they own.","Stars Arena is a version of FriendTech, an app that lets you buy tokens that give access to an individual\u2019s chat room. The tokens are typically priced on a bonding curve, so they get increasingly more expensive as more people buy the tokens. Fees are also quite high on these types of apps, with FriendTech charging 10% in fees on every transaction, split between the app and the group\u2019s owner.","Stars Arena was recently hit by a much smaller <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/254926\/stars-arena-faces-vulnerability-that-can-potentially-let-users-drain-funds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">vulnerability<\/a> that enabled anyone to drain Avax coins from the project's smart contract. However, the bug was difficult to exploit because it wasn\u2019t profitable when transaction fees were high and few funds were lost before it was fixed.","At the time, Ava Labs CEO Emin Gun Sirer <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/el33th4xor\/status\/1709923165919387999\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">described<\/a> reports on the issue as \u201CFUD\u201D \u2014 effectively meaning unwarranted criticism \u2014&nbsp;and said it was time to get back to having fun in the arena. Stars Arena also did a long <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/starsarenacom\/status\/1709934535570608172\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">post<\/a> on X claiming it was being targeted by malicious actors in \u201Ccoordinated FUD\u201D and promised that \u201CWe will fight, we will survive, we will win.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
