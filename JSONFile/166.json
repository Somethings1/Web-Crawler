Sunak has already secured the backing of at least 100 Tory MPs, meaning he will be considered in the ballot of party members next week if he declares that he is running.&nbsp;","Outgoing Prime Minister Liz Truss was confirmed as the country's leader <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/167785\/sunaks-crypto-charm-offensive-brought-to-an-end-as-truss-named-uk-prime-minister\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on Sept. 5.<\/a> She resigned this week following a backlash to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's economic plan, which included tax cuts for top earners.&nbsp;","Sunak also ran in the last leadership election, but had lost out in the last round with 43% of the vote to Truss's 57%.&nbsp;","This time, other candidates in contention are ousted prime minister Boris Johnson and the leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt. Only three members of parliament will be able to get to the next round, as there are a total of 357 Conservative MPs.","<script async=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/script>","Sunak proved himself as overtly crypto curious when he served as chancellor for the Exchequer between February 2020 and July 2022.

He also made moves for stablecoins to be brought within regulation, paving their way for use in the UK as a recognized form of payment.","The move came amid a protracted period of confusion around crypto regulation in the UK, as firms waited for verdicts from the financial regulator on anti-money laundering licensing.
