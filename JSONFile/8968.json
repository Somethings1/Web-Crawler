All the relays that exist are vertically integrated builder relays,\u201D Hasu <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hasufl\/status\/1582005123794235395?s=20&amp;t=EaQoshfZurttGMnkmY6Tkw\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted.<\/a>","A vertically integrated builder is \u201Ca relay that also operates a builder and hence has an incentive to favor blocks of that builder over blocks of external builders,\u201D Hasu later told The Block via direct message on Twitter.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174386\/flashbots-now-accounts-for-39-of-ethereum-blocks-as-censorship-concerns-rise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Flashbots<\/a> provides maximal extracted value (MEV) relay services to Ethereum blockchain validators. Because it operates in the U.S., it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174386\/flashbots-now-accounts-for-39-of-ethereum-blocks-as-censorship-concerns-rise\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">censors<\/a> all transactions from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177504\/templedao-hacker-moves-funds-via-sanctioned-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tornado Cash<\/a>, which was sanctioned by Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for money laundering. A growing number of staking services are relying on Flashbots to extract the greatest value from block validation, making censorship more widespread.","Many developers also don't trust builder relays given a lack of insight as to whether those relays are configured to favor themselves over network participants, Hasu said.&nbsp;","The stir over censorship ultimately led to the recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175709\/flashbots-co-founder-steps-down-after-disagreements-with-team-over-censorship\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">resignation<\/a> of Flashbots co-founder Stephane Gosselin. He told The Block that he hoped \u201CValidators will avoid connecting to relays that perform censorship.\u201D","Flashbots acknowledged its role in the issue of censorship, and said it will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/174977\/flashbots-product-lead-addresses-concerns-over-tornado-cash-censorship\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">take steps<\/a> to mitigate the problem.
