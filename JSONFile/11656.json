Until this house of cards collapses, leaving people buried under their losses.\"","For the most part, this means holding crypto-assets to traditional financial system standards. That includes implementing Financial Action Task Force (FATF) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/122372\/fatf-final-crypto-guidance-defi-nft\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">standards<\/a>, aligning tax reporting for crypto with the wider financial system and perhaps implementing higher taxes for crypto activities seen as potentially harmful for the environment, like proof of work.","Panetta also advocated for additional mandatory disclosure and transparency requirements for crypto firms and the strengthening of public authorities to detect illicit trades and emerging threats.","He pointed out that the growth of the crypto sector shows a wider hunger for better financial infrastructure, and central banks must respond with faster retail payment systems and the issuance of central bank digital currencies.","Panetta touted the work of the EU on its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/142220\/european-commission-receives-more-than-10000-public-comments-amid-digital-euro-consultation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">digital euro<\/a> and the European Commission's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/137720\/europes-landmark-crypto-bill-passes-parliamentary-committee-with-wide-majority\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Regulation of Markets in Crypto-Assets<\/a>, which recently passed through its parliamentary committee. The crypto framework would unify standards for crypto firms in the EU. But Panetta hopes to go further:","\"We need to focus more on unbacked crypto-asset activities that are undertaken without service providers. In addition, we cannot afford to leave on-chain peer-to-peer payments unregulated, as they can be used to circumvent any regulation. Finally, if we really want to harmonise supervision significantly across all EU Member States, the new European AML Authority should supervise the riskiest crypto-asset providers.\"","But those standards will only be effective if they are \"matched by ambitious measures implemented by our international peers,\" said Panetta.","Â© 2023 The Block.
