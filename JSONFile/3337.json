The U.S. Senate recently passed a bill, for instance, that would remove Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges unless they allowed regulators access to their audit records. In 2014, Alibaba, which owns 33% of Ant Group\u2019s shares, raised $25 billion after listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The move also comes in the wake of a controversial <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/06\/30\/china-reportedly-passes-national-security-law-for-hong-kong.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">new Hong Kong national security law<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, which China passed late last month. Critics have said the law will undermine Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, but Ant's planned listing suggests that companies still see Hong Kong as an attractive market.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Geopolitics aside, though, Ant Group's IPO is also relevant to digital currency and blockchain development. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alipay is already a ubiquitous mobile payment platform in China, where the use of cash has fallen dramatically in the past several years. But the platform and its main competitor in China, Tencent's WeChat Pay, are also expected to play a role in the distribution of China\u2019s forthcoming central bank digital currency.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As The Block <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/63120\/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-central-bank-digital-currency\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has reported<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, Tencent and Alipay are both working on projects related to the digital currency, called Digital Currency Electronic Payment, or DC\/EP.
