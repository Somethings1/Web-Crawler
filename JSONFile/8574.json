Contagion stemming from the collapse then contributed to Celsius filing for bankruptcy and the implosion of Three Arrows Capital in July. FTX later experienced a liquidity crunch after allegedly misusing customer funds and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November. Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has since been arrested in The Bahamas and charged with criminal fraud.&nbsp;","According to crypto analytics firm Chainalysis, UST's collapse <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.chainalysis.com\/reports\/ftx-investor-impact-less-than-previous-crises\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">caused<\/a> $20.5 billion in realized losses for investors. Meanwhile, the failure of Celsius and Three Arrows Capital caused $33 billion in losses.&nbsp;FTX's collapse caused 'only' $9 billion in realized losses.","Chainalysis's report admits that FTX was the most personally impactful event for some, as they will \"likely lose any funds they kept on the exchange, and the likelihood of recovering them is unknown.\" However, the firm notes that \"the heaviest hitting crypto events of 2022 were already behind investors by the time the FTX debacle took place\" \u2014 from a market-wide point of view.","Chainalysis conclusions come after measuring realized gains and losses for a set of personal wallets in a given period \u2014 which provides \"a directional sense of when investors lock in gains and losses.\"","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
