Operating expenses rose to 46 million DAI in 2022, more than double the figure reported the previous year.","MakerDAO\u2019s decreased earnings followed the general crypto downturn of 2022 in which the market experienced a massive deleveraging cycle triggered by collapses of the Terra ecosystem and the FTX exchange \u2014 events that occurred amid a significant slowdown in the global financial markets and impacted both centralized and decentralized participants in crypto lending.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/cryptocurrency-lending\/dai-outstanding-daily\/embed\" title=\"DAI Outstanding\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Maker's total balance shrunk to 5 billion DAI at the end of 2022, a 43% decline from the 9 billion at the end of the previous year, according to Steakhouse.","MakerDAO engineered a significant shift in DAI economics last year that saw a pivot to real-world asset backing. The Maker protocol issues the DAI stablecoin, which users mint in exchange for approved collateral assets that are supplied in excess of the amount of DAI being minted.","The volume of Maker\u2019s real-world asset vault balance grew to 640 million DAI at the end of 2022. This figure marks a 37-fold increase from the end of 2021, with a large portion of the growth occurring in the last half of 2022 including a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/175311\/makerdao-initiates-500-million-investment-in-us-treasuries-corporate-bonds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">500 million DAI vault<\/a> for Monetalis Clydesdale and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/156301\/makerdao-approves-100-million-stablecoin-loan-vault-for-151-year-old-us-bank\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">100 million DAI vault<\/a> allocation for Huntingdon Valley Bank.","The impact of Maker\u2019s real-world asset push can also be seen in its revenue-generation matrix, with the vaults accounting for 70% of MakerDAO\u2019s gross revenue in December, according to the report. That's despite the fact that the vaults only accounted for a tenth of the DAI minted over the period.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
