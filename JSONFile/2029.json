Some praised the former Airbnb engineer for attempting to cultivate an ideologically inclusive environment. Others argued that the tone of the piece was cold and out of touch.","As for the severance package, Armstrong is offering employees keen on leaving as much as six months of severance and a potential seven year option exercise window.&nbsp;","Here's a passage from the email:","","","Armstrong added:","\"If you're interested in speaking with HR about this package (not committing to take it, but beginning a discussion) please fill out this form and someone will reach out shortly. Your conversation will be confidential with HR unless you choose to include your manager. If you decide to proceed, HR will provide you with a separation agreement and work with you on your last day.\"","In a sense, the email is in line with the original blog and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2018\/02\/amazon-offer-pay-quit\/553202\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reflects<\/a> how at least one other large corporation handled a similar situation. In 2018, Amazon&nbsp;asked a number of its \u201Cassociates\u201D\u2014 full-time and part-time hourly employees \u2014 to leave if they wanted, as reported by The Atlantic. In turn, Amazon offered them a $5,000 check.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
