With derivatives volumes hitting 1.5 times the size of the spot market in 2021, the derivatives market emerged as an indicator for price movements, similar to traditional finance.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CRecently, what we\u2019re finding is that the derivatives market is now the velocity of the price moves,\u201D said Omid Zadeh, Head of Business Development EMEA, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.matrixport.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Matrixport<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Derivatives\u2019 popularity lies in its leverage potential where investors can manage risk and trade at a lower cost with less capital. The market cycle has evolved and with derivatives\u2019 soaring rise, looking at derivative volume patterns has now become an indication of who\u2019s buying in the space.&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Piloting the Demand<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Institutional interest in the space has also seen significant growth. Particularly, after the large crypto price drop offs experienced in the first half of 2021, retail investing took a backseat to institutional participation as traditional forex markets stayed sombre.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Diving deeper, there are differing preferences within the category, too. From speaking to the TradFi institutions, the observation was a tendency to lean towards trading on US-regulated exchanges whereas, for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.matrixport.com\/institutions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the crypto-native institutions<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, they were open-minded in trading across global exchanges where there are alpha generating opportunities.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Looking to the future, the industry foresees that institutional demand, combined with the Futures ETF and the bullish trend, are a \u201Crecipe\u201D for increasing derivatives trading volumes at a larger multiple than spot going forward.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe are the bridge between the traditional space and DeFi, and bringing that together for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.matrixport.com\/institutions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">institutions<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in the safest possible manner.\u201D \u2014 Omid Zadeh<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s safe to say that the takeoff of institutional demand is promising \u2014 providing opportunities for new crypto offerings and innovation to serve the growing demand.<\/span>","&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Navigating Headwinds&nbsp;<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The route to the perception of crypto as mainstream is fraught with some hurdles.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On this, the harmonisation of regulation to encourage innovation is critical. Crypto stakeholders have a role to play in engaging policy-makers and sharing crypto\u2019s potential use cases. This will ensure that the market continues to grow in a sensible way and opens the doors for more investors.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While crypto\u2019s foray into the mainstream is highly anticipated, predictions for the outcomes differ. One hand, there are expectations of a transition towards OTC trading as crypto exchanges become overcrowded and more crypto offerings are integrated into TradFi (e.g. institutional spot markets, equity brokerage firms) \u2014 making it even easier to trade. On the other hand, there is a strong conviction that crypto exchanges will continue to be a driving force, powered by innovation.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">All that said, there is one thing we know for sure \u2014 crypto structured products are taking flight and all those watching need only to enjoy the journey through a hybrid world of CeFi and DeFi.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
