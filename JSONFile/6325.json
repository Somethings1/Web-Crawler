BITO was the first Bitcoin-linked ETF in the US and is one of the most popular among institutional investors, allowing them to gain exposure to Bitcoin-linked returns with a regulated product.","Highlighting the performance of the ETF, Balchunas added: \"Interesting thing regarding BITO, even though it got trashed by some because futures roll costs, it pretty much has tracked bitcoin perfectly. It's lagged spot by 1.05% annually, but its fee is 0.95%, equalling only 10bps of roll, extra costs, which is rounding error, many had predicted over 5% per year.\"","The recent surge in Bitcoin prices, reaching a recent high of over $31,000 and marking a 14% monthly gain, appears to be spurred by interest from institutional ETF filings.","Â© 2023 The Block.
