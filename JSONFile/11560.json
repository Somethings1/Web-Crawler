This is because the wrapped bitcoin-focused project was acquired in February 2021 by the now-collapsed trading firm Alameda Research. It appears that Alameda was controlling the infrastructure behind the network \u2014 separately from its node operators \u2014&nbsp;and the team doesn\u2019t have all the information.","\u201CWe don't know exactly when, depends on when infrastructure [shuts] down which we aren't in control of, could be in the next few days, or a week or two, we don't know [at the moment] but trying to figure out,\u201D said Maximilian Roszko, ecosystem advocate at Ren protocol, in the project\u2019s Discord channel.","The network supports tokens wrapped from other blockchains. Chief among them is renBTC, a tokenized version of bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. If Ren goes down, these tokens won\u2019t necessarily have any value, and they won\u2019t be able to be sent back to their original chains to unlock the collateral.&nbsp;","As a result, Ren has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/193274\/alameda-backed-ren-warns-users-of-losses-as-it-plans-to-wind-down-protocol\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">warned<\/a>&nbsp;users to send these tokens back to their respective chains to unlock this collateral before the network suddenly shuts down. Yet, despite these warnings, more than $15 million of renBTC remains on Ethereum and is at risk of getting stuck.","Roszko said the team wouldn\u2019t have access to any funds when the network gets shut down. That said, it could be theoretically restarted in the future, which might allow for a recovery process.","When asked whether the node operators on the network could force a manual restart, Roszko said this was not possible due to Alameda\u2019s involvement.","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer:<\/i><\/b><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
