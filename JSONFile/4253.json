The country's High Court again decided that the requests were valid on Dec. 29, after which Do Kwon re-appealed in January.","The Appeals Court cited issues in the process, particularly the lack of clear reasons and facts in the High Court\u2019s decision, which constitutes grounds for its revocation, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/sudovi.me\/ascg\/sadrzaj\/66RJ\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">statement<\/a>.","Specifically, the appeals court said there were procedural issues in how the extradition requests were handled, and that the order of the arrival of the requests from South Korea and the U.S. were not unambiguously determined.","The case will now return to the first-instance court to be reconsidered.","Do Kwon\u2019s extradition had been sought for charges related to financial crimes in the U.S. and South Korea, stemming from the multi-billion dollar collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022.&nbsp;","Kwon was initially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222286\/do-kwon-terra-luna-arrested-montenegro\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">arrested<\/a> in Montenegro last March, charged with using a fake passport to attempt to leave the country. However, he was freed from jail pending trial after a court agreed to a $436,000 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230575\/do-kwon-bail\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bail<\/a> in May. Subsequently, in June, a Montenegro court sentenced him to four months in prison after finding him <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235448\/do-kwon-found-guilty-in-montenegro-fake-passport-case\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">guilty<\/a> of document forgery. Kwon appealed that court decision, lost the appeal, and was finally sentenced to four months in November.","Kwon was the focus of a worldwide search in September 2022 when global police body Interpol reportedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172739\/south-korea-says-interpol-has-issued-a-red-notice-for-do-kwon-bloomberg-says\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued<\/a> a so-called red notice for him, stemming from the May 2022 collapse of the two tokens he had created \u2014 TerraUSD and Luna \u2014 which wiped out some $40 billion of investor wealth in a few days.","On Monday, Do Kwon's ex-colleague, former Terraform Labs CFO Han Chang-joon, was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/275985\/terraform-labs-former-cfo-extradited-south-korea\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">extradited<\/a> from Montenegro to South Korea.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
