Another source said the negative reaction among employees resulted from an apparent misinterpretation by Armstrong of the question and whether it was about the Black Lives Matter movement or the Black Lives Matter Foundation, the nonprofit organization&nbsp;that advocates for a wide range of socio-political changes in America.","A source told The Block that \u201Chundreds\u201D of employees took part in the walkout, which took place soon after the AMA. The source said that the walkout primarily took the form of a refusal to work, given that Coinbase\u2019s workforce is largely remote as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.","Soon after the walkout, Armstrong <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brian_armstrong\/status\/1268622377182621696?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a>&nbsp;in a June 4 tweet that \u201CI want to unequivocally say that Black Lives Matter\u201D and later added that \u201C[a]fter speaking with our Black employees this week, it became clear to me how much pain they are in during this moment. I feel an obligation to support all employees at Coinbase, especially our Black employees right now, who are experiencing something I will never fully understand.\u201D","Earlier this week, Erica Baker, director of engineering for GitHub, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EricaJoy\/status\/1310741842594426880\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> about the walkout, writing that \u201Ca large portion of the coinbase engineering team walked off the job just before that thread went up because brian *wouldn't* say \u2018black lives matter.\u2019\u201D","As Baker noted at the time, an array of U.S. companies moved to affirm their commitment to Black lives and voices following the widespread uproar over the death of George Floyd, the Minneapolis resident who was killed during an attempted arrest in late May. Floyd\u2019s death triggered protests throughout the United States and brought renewed attention to race issues.","Details of the story were also published in reports by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/interface\/2020\/9\/30\/21493906\/brian-armstrong-coinbase-blog-post-politics-workplace-activism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Verge<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/coinbase-controversy-b707973c-0f24-4d1e-9690-78ac5fdb94e7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Axios<\/a> in the past day. Axios reported that, per a source, \"Armstrong argued making a public statement in support of BLM would be divisive.\"","Rumors about the walkout began to circulate after the event and Armstrong\u2019s comment on Twitter. Armstrong himself highlighted \u201Cemployee walkouts\u201D in a controversial blog <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">post<\/a> published this week, during which he wrote that Coinbase \u201Cis a mission focused company\u201D and should pursue \u201Cprogress toward our mission, as compared to broader societal issues.\u201D&nbsp;","Armstrong drew both criticism and praise for his remarks, but a leaked email later indicated that some internal staffers disagreed with the approach \u2014 and that Coinbase was offering a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/79247\/coinbase-offers-exit-package-for-employees-not-comfortable-with-its-mission?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">compensated<\/a> exit for those employees.","On Wednesday, those tensions played out in a company internal Slack channel designated for political discussion. During the discussion, an international employee challenged the company\u2019s mission to create an open-financial system despite mainly servicing white, mostly well-off Americans, a source who reviewed the messages told The Block.","On Thursday, Coinbase held an AMA session to discuss the tensions as well as recent developments at the firm more generally.&nbsp;","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post has been updated for clarity.&nbsp;<\/em>","© 2023 The Block.
