It purports to provide access to decentralized applications through a combination of IPFS \u2014 a decentralized hosting service \u2014 and the Ethereum Name Service, which provides names and web domains for crypto addresses.","While blockchain applications can be interacted with directly, their front-end services (the website that you use to interact with the protocol) can be shut off. In the case of Tornado Cash, its front-end website was disabled after the U.S. Treasury <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162105\/us-treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-mixer-tornado-cash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">placed sanctions<\/a> on it. The result is that while developers can still interact with it, it\u2019s largely inaccessible for the average person.","Dappnet is designed to solve this by essentially creating a decentralized front end for any blockchain application.","\u201CAll of this put together, means that for the first time ever we can own a place on the Internet that can\u2019t be taken away from us, and doesn\u2019t rely on a single host who dictates what is allowed. I think that will have a profound impact for the web,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/liamzebedee\/status\/1578128194082701312\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> Zebedee on Twitter.","How Dappnet works for the user is they click the application on their computer and it takes them to a version that\u2019s hosted on IPFS. It runs the Ethereum Name Service domain locally on the user\u2019s computer and it runs an IPFS node in the background, sharing the data in a peer-to-peer fashion with other IPFS nodes.","\u201CI have not tested it, but it looks like a promising way to access web3 dapps 'locally' without the need of a trusted third party (ie a hosting service which we know can and would be taken down by legal order),\u201D said Ouriel Ohayon, CEO of crypto wallet <a href=\"https:\/\/zengo.com\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ZenGo<\/a>, via a direct message on Twitter.","Zebedee acknowledged that there are still a few issues with this approach, mostly related to IPFS. He said that IPFS nodes could be improved if they were lighter and that it should be much easier to deploy a website to IPFS.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
