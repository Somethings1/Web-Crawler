Web3 is about building a business in a different way. It\u2019s being able to give the self-sovereignty back to the users, trying to find a community-first way to drive a lot of the value creation and distribution. Yes, I think a token may be one way to actually do that, but a lot of the businesses are probably not organic enough to even have a token to start with.\u201D","Zhang\u2019s comments come off the back of a dramatic week for crypto firms in the U.S., where the Securities and Exchange Commission filed lawsuits against both Binance and Coinbase \u2014 in which it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233174\/solana-matic-cardano-others-securities-sec-binance-lawsuit\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">described dozens of tokens as securities<\/a>. The suits could be seen as the culmination of a months-long crackdown on the sector in the U.S.","Regulatory uncertainty around crypto globally and market volatility stemming from it have given many crypto projects pause over whether to bring planned tokens to market. In January, venture capitalists in the space said half their token bets <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/199734\/crypto-vc-token-bets-delayed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">remain sidelined<\/a>, with no clear pathway to launch.","The impact on venture firms in the crypto sector could be significant. In the past year or more, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/171609\/why-equity-plus-token-warrants-is-the-new-go-to-formula-for-crypto-vcs?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the de facto structure<\/a> for crypto venture deals has been for startups to sell both equity and warrants for tokens \u2014 to be launched at some point in the future \u2014 to backers. Delays to those tokens hitting exchanges will inevitably dent VC profits.","\u201COn the venture investor side, they need to be more patient,\u201D Zhang said, adding that investors should no longer expect to see returns on token investments materialize within 12 to 24 months. \u201CAnd it may not come back any time soon.\u201D","Launched in late 2021, Hivemind\u2019s first fund was a $1.5 billion multi-strategy investment vehicle that has invested in the likes of Helium, Napster and a revived, web3-oriented LimeWire. Zhang aims to collect $300 million for the new open-ended Liquid Opportunity Fund, but so far has raised $60 million.","\u201CThese are good opportunities, so we want to definitely double down and capitalize on them,\u201D he said.","Â© 2023 The Block.
