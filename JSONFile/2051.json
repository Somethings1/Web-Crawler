They feature a range of attributes, ranging from different expressions to outfits, hairdoos and even having cheetah fur.","<a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/assets\/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d\/7990\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Curry's bored ape<\/a> in particular has blue fur, zombie eyes and is wearing a tweed suit. The last two are particularly rare attributes, with only 3% of apes having zombie eyes and 1% of apes wearing tweed suits.","Since the sale, there have been a few offers made on his NFT, although they are far below the price that he paid for it. The NFT was previously sold for 1.5 ETH ($4,875 at current prices) three months ago, and 0.68 ETH ($2,210) before that.","Curry's purchase comes just ahead of the snapshot happening today of all bored ape holders. After the snapshot, all bored ape holders will be receiving a \"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mutant Serum<\/span>\" per ape. It's not clear what the serum will do but one possibility is that it could turn a current bored ape into a bored mutant ape (or something along those lines).","The prices of bored apes have shot up over the last month or so. The current floor price \u2014 the cheapest on offer right now \u2014 is 25 ETH ($81,250) according to <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/boredapeyachtclub\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OpenSea<\/a>, although there doesn't appear to be an ape for sale under 44.9 ETH ($146,000).
