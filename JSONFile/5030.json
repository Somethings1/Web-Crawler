Long-tail assets saw an even steeper sell-off, with Avalanche, Shiba Inu and Cardano falling by double-digit percentage points.&nbsp;","\"Big risk off move across the board,\" noted Chris Hermida of Manna Trading.&nbsp;","The price action in the crypto market again illustrates the degree to which liquid tokens have tracked global stocks \u2014 similar to the way it has amid the US Federal Reserve's plan to hike interest rates. The news out of Ukraine is expected to add further pressure to a global economy gripped by mounting inflation and supply chain headaches. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading down more than 2.23% at the time of writing.&nbsp;","Indeed, this is the latest example of bitcoin failing to live up to its promise as a hedge against various forms of uncertainty. It's 30-day correlation to gold\u2014which has long been viewed as a safe haven asset in times of distressed markets\u2014 slipped from 0.28 on February 16 to 0.17 on February 22, while bitcoin's correlation to the S&amp;P 500 has ticked up.","\"The correlation between crypto and stock markets has been pretty solid over the last few months on both inflation news and geopolitical issues,\" noted Nigel Green, chief executive officer of deVere Group.","Joshua Lim of Genesis Trading <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/joshua_j_lim\/status\/1496618021292593154?s=20&amp;t=Bmt1pOtHyQ7JvQWpwwWTTQ\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> that investor wariness of the crypto market is behind that increase in correlation between bitcoin and US equities, with bitcoin moving \"on a 2ish beta to the SPX.\"","","","Still, gold \u2014 which has been enjoying a rally amid the intensifying tensions between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 pulled back Thursday morning. JPMorgan noted to clients that there is a risk that Russia could sell some of its gold reserves to fund its military operation.&nbsp;","","","In the short term, traders are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/135292\/eth-market-faces-500-million-liquidation-if-price-drops-below-2100?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">keeping an eye<\/a> on Ethereum, given the large number of on-chain liquidations that would be triggered at the $2,100-$2,200 level.&nbsp;","As explained by my colleague Osato Avan-Nomayo, \"an automatic liquidation of $500 million in ether (ETH) could occur on-chain if its price falls below $2,100, causing a Maker vault holder's position to become under-collateralized and putting further downward pressure on the second-biggest cryptocurrency.\"","In general, market participants anticipate geo-political uncertainty and news out of the Fed &nbsp;to continue to weigh on the market.","\"On the crypto front, surprised to see Bitcoin continue to maintain the $35K mark without dipping under $30K,\" said Aya Kantorovich of crypto financial services firm FalconX in a message to The Block.","Kantorovich added: \"All eyes on the Fed for whether March rate hikes will continue to stay in the books while we're waiting for the 12:30 pm ET Biden address on Ukraine today.\"","While macro events have pushed bitcoin to lows above $34,000, one executive pointed to a saving grace that could support the market from a severe drawdown: institutional capital sitting on the sidelines.&nbsp;","\"Macro tourist money is the fastest to exit, as they free up capital in the most liquid instruments to meet margin calls,\" said GSR co-founder Rich Rosenblum. \"But, there are a lot of underinvested institutional pockets of capital looking to invest in crypto, waiting on the sidelines for a dip.
