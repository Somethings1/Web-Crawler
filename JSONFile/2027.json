To DeFi proponents, these decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are different beasts to the classic central counterparties required in traditional finance: they exist purely as code allowing individuals to trade with one another.&nbsp;","\"If you host a website that makes it easy for U.S. retail to connect to and trade on a DEX, you would likely have to register it as something like a broker-dealer\/FCM\/etc. You would also potentially have KYC [know your customer] obligations,\" Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftxpolicy.com\/posts\/possible-digital-asset-industry-standards\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wrote<\/a> on Wednesday. At the same time, the crypto exchange executive said it's \"extremely important that on-chain code and DeFi remain free and open, and uncensored.\"","One particularly loud voice is that of scupytrooples, the pseudonymous founder of DeFi protocol Alchemix, who <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/scupytrooples\/status\/1582891034744606720\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> a list of unsubstantiated complaints against Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;","<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"I&nbsp;<\/span>see them using the playbook of large corporations, where they ascend to the top, and then get involved in lobbying to make rules favorable for them to hurt the competition, and ultimately cement their position there,\" scupytrooples told The Block in separate comments. \"No different from Amazon, Exxon Mobil, Goldman, etc.\"","\"He's been on the record that he doesn't care about crypto and is only here for the money,\" they continued. \"It's plainly obvious to see he is not a good actor in this space.\"","Bankman-Fried didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Block.","Anthony Sassano, a well-known independent Ethereum educator, also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sassal0x\/status\/1582529301852737536\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">criticised<\/a> the FTX CEO, who is often known by his intitials.","\"SBF is and always will be a cancer on this ecosystem,\" he wrote to his 225,000 Twitter followers. \"Anyone supporting him and his cronies should be ashamed.\"","Sassano's statements came in response to Scott Lewis, the founder of DeFi Pulse and other projects, who has also been critical of Bankman-Fried.","\"SBF trying to get a bad law passed,\" Lewis <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/scott_lew_is\/status\/1582850702338306048\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> on Twitter. \"Now is the time to get loud and fight.\"","Specifically, he suggested boycotting both FTX and \"crypto media on Sam's payroll,\" as well as denylisting FTX users from airdrops.","The list of high-profile crypto-related accounts on Twitter sharing similarly negative sentiments is long, while those defending Bankman-Fried's proposal are few and far between.","Those coming to Bankman-Fried's defense tended to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/friedmandave\/status\/1582847590353489920\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cite<\/a> the belief that regulation in the crypto industry is an inevitability. \"Better to have a dialogue about it than to pretend that crypto is immune to regulation or ought not be regulated,\" shared one account, which Bankman-Fried retweeted.","Others argue that the FTX CEO's proposed regulations are a necessity to onboard more institutions into crypto. \"Unpopular opinion: I am intimately familiar with conversations happening with lawyers at public companies who want to get into crypto,\" <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PetrifyTCG\/status\/1582904935796322304\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> one account.
