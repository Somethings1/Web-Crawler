Specifically, Standard Chartered used the first U.S.-based gold ETF \u2014 SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) \u2014 as a point of comparison.

It noted that the price of gold rose 4.3 times in the seven to eight years it took for gold ETP holdings to mature after GLD was introduced.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We expect bitcoin to enjoy price gains of a similar magnitude as a result of U.S. spot ETF approval, but we see these gains materializing over a shorter (one- to two-year) period, given our view that the BTC ETF market will develop more quickly,\" the bank said. \"This is consistent with our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227935\/crypto-winter-bitcoin-price-standard-chartered\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">end-2024 view of bitcoin<\/a> at the $100,000 level. If ETF-related inflows materialize as we expect, we think an end-2025 level closer to $200,000 is possible. This assumes that between 437,000 and 1.32 million new bitcoins will be held in spot U.S. ETFs by end-2024. In USD terms, this should be roughly $50-100 billion.\"<\/span>","Several firms have also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268199\/sec-delays-decisions-on-hashdex-and-grayscale-ethereum-focused-etfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/a> for spot ether ETFs, and the bank expects approval for those ETFs in the second quarter of this year. The SEC will view ETH ETFs differently from BTC ones, according to Standard Chartered, as SEC Chair Gary Gensler once said everything other than bitcoin is potentially a security. Notably, however, as ETH was not listed among the 67 coins and tokens the SEC alleged were securities when it sued several exchanges, it is \"ultimately likely to allow spot ETH ETFs,\" the bank said.","The price dynamics of gold versus silver around the introduction of their respective ETFs offer valuable insights regarding expected bitcoin and ether prices, according to the bank.","The silver fund SLV was introduced in April 2006, following the introduction of GLD in November 2004. Gold outperformed post-ETP introduction, likely due to actual inflows, while silver outperformed leading up to its ETP launch, presumably driven by anticipated flows into the relatively less liquid silver market. However, silver later relinquished its relative performance after the ETP introduction.","\"Silver ETP flows vary in both directions more significantly than gold, but can also represent a much larger market share of annual flows,\u201D the bank said.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
