Felman, who co-leads the firm's flagship fund, navigated price gyrations stemming from macro and industry news, ranging from headlines that government officials recovered funds from Bitfinex's 2016 hack to more recent news that Russia could invade neighbor Ukraine.","On this episode of The Scoop, Felman explained the decision-making process that goes into making a trade on headlines, using reports that Russia was on the verge of invading Ukraine as one case study example.&nbsp;","\"I know that the context is that the Biden administration has been warning about Russia for quite some time,\" he said.&nbsp;\"I know that bitcoin doesn't like uncertainty. I read the headline as being extremely uncertain.\"","Whether a certain news event adds uncertainty is just one factor Felman considers. Timing is equally important.&nbsp;","\"Okay, I want to make a trade and this all happens in the span of, you have to think, about 15 to 30 seconds,\" he explained. \"You need to make those connections. Then I need to start de-risking a little bit.\"","In some instances, Felman takes a cue from the S&amp;P 500, which has been moving very closely with bitcoin despite the crypto's reputation as a hedge asset.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The vast majority of time the bitcoin decouples from the S&amp;P, it's because of a delayed reaction,\" he said. \"It's because bitcoin has some idiosyncratic crypto native bidder that isn't paying attention to broader risk.\"<\/span>","On this episode, Felman and Chaparro also unpack:","Â© 2023 The Block.
