During a Twitter standoff, members of the Yearn community implied that Aave was vulnerable to a potential exploit.","Yearn founder Andre Cronje tweeted earlier Friday that \"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Aave is vulnerable to the same exploit\" as the one that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/122241\/ethereum-defi-protocol-cream-finance-hacked-for-115-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">impacted Cream Finance<\/a> on Wednesday, which resulted in the theft of $130 million worth of tokens.<\/span>","\"M<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">aybe don't bad mouth other projects while sitting on an 11 figure vulnerability,\" <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bantg\/status\/1453982648834068480\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> Yearn core developer banteg.

It is unclear if this is the same vulnerability to which the Yearn developers alluded.","Aave claims that it ran simulations that showed any attackers trying this exploit approach would end up losing money. Despite this, Aave has highlighted a proposal that has been made to disable functions related to xSUSHI as a precuationary measure.","Aave token holders are currently able to <a href=\"https:\/\/app.aave.com\/#\/governance\/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">vote on the proposal<\/a> through its governance platform.","Â© 2023 The Block.
