When the attorney arrived to the meeting as requested, Attorney-1 fired him,\u201D the report reads.","The report also claims that Attorney-1 helped Bankman-Fried lie to Congress during testimony before a Senate committee, and aided in the creation of a \u201Csham agreement\u201D to mask the source of fund transfers in order to allow FTX to continue to allegedly redirect customer assets.","According to FTX\u2019s bankruptcy lawyers, that included drafting and backdating a fake intercompany agreement in order to deceive an external auditor in preparation for a potential initial public offering in 2021.","\u201CWhile the IPO was not ultimately consummated, the FTX Group proceeded to share the false and misleading audited financials with potential investors in connection with its $400 million Series C financing that closed in January 2022,\u201D the report claims.","FTX\u2019s move from Hong Kong to the Bahamas was largely to avoid scrutiny into possibly illegal operations, the bankruptcy court document claims.","\u201CIn moving to the Bahamas, where they incorporated FTX DM in July 2021, the FTX Senior Executives sought to minimize any substantive change to or scrutiny of their business,\u201D says the report.","Attorney-1 paid a \u201Cformer Bahamian official\u201D a $1 million bonus for obtaining a business license for FTX Digital Markets, the main FTX.com platform, which was located in the Bahamas. The former official obtained the license within six weeks, four less than the company had set as its goal.","The FTX group\u2019s current leadership now alleges that FTX used the Bahamian operation to funnel at least $5.4 billion of customer assets into another corporate entity.","FTX executives also spent over $243 million in company funds to make themselves feel more at home in the Bahamas, including buying multimillion dollar properties for friends and family in addition to employees.","At the direction of Bankman-Fried and other executives, the group of companies bought over 30 properties, including the infamous six bedroom, 11,500 square foot penthouse at the Albany resort community in Nassau where the FTX owner and his lieutenants Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh, and Gary Wang all lived.","\u201CThe FTX Group funded these real estate purchases from accounts that held commingled customer and corporate funds,\u201D the report claims.","According to the report, despite claiming to be funded by FTX customer fees, the FTX Foundation instead drew money out of Alameda Research and North Dimension bank accounts that received FTX customer assets, which were commingled with corporate funds.","One of the grants issued using commingled funds was to further the creation of animated YouTube videos related to Effective Altruism, according to details provided in the report.","The FTX caretaker leadership says approximately $20 million from an account where customer funds were commingled was sent to Guarding Against Pandemics, a nonprofit founded by Bankman-Fried\u2019s brother, Gabe.","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
