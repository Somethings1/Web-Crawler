Anyone can vote on the poll with tokens they have delegated to themselves, or tokens that have been delegated to them. Voting is done through signing a message in MetaMask rather than making an on-chain transaction. So far, 41.43 million UNI tokens have been used to vote in favor of the proposal, with just 204 UNI tokens voting against.","\u201CAssuming the snapshot passes we intend to support the community by deploying the v3 smart contracts to Arbitrum!
