Mendham is also restrained from traveling outside of Australia.","The court order came after ASIC alleged the companies breached Australian law and provided financial services without an Australian financial services license.","\"ASIC alleges that the NGS Companies target Australian investors to invest in blockchain mining packages with fixed-rate returns, encouraging them to use funds transferred from regulated super funds to self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and then converted into cryptocurrency,\" the regulator said.","The involvement of a restructuring company does not necessarily suggest the companies have collapsed. ASIC said it was concerned the funds were at risk of dissipation and appointing a receiver was the best way to protect the assets.","While it continues to investigate, ASIC has not sought an outright ban on the companies but only interim and final injunctions preventing them from operating without a license.","The NGS companies did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.","Read More: Australian Judge Hands Split Decision in Market\u2019s Regulator vs Block Earner","Edited by Sheldon Reback.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NGS Group","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Australian Federal Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NGS Digital","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"NGS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Australia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US$41 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Brett Mendham","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ryan Brown","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"NGS Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mark Ten Caten","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Australia","Mining","ASIC","Court","Federal Court","Crimes"],"authors":["Amitoj Singh"]}
