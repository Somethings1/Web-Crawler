These proposed stealth addresses are a way to increase privacy on Ethereum by creating unique, anonymous addresses for each transaction.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Each time someone makes a transaction, they can generate a new stealth address so that it is difficult for anyone to track the transactions or determine who is sending and receiving assets. This means that each user's transactional history can remain private. Buterin also suggested using ZK-SNARKs, shorthand for zero-knowledge proofs, to boost the privacy of the system and make it difficult to link the stealth addresses.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On Ethereum, transactions are public by default, which can pose a privacy concern. There are ways to attain transactional privacy on the network, such as using cryptocurrency mixers like Tornado Cash. However, such methods can raise regulatory issues. This was seen with Tornado Cash, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for potentially illicit activities.&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
