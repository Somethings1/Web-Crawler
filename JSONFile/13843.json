In some cases, those companies themselves may have tokens on their personal balance sheets, he added. Funds from firms such as a16z and Pantera Capital are down more than 50% this year as token prices dropped amid a challenging macro environment.","\"We are not looking to be the number one performer, in fact, we are definitely not,\" Tapiero said, describing the fund's more conservative strategy.","\"Even with SBF and with all this nonsense, this is the greatest macro investment I've seen in years,\" Tapiero said. \"I don't know what's a bigger trade than the digitization of money. So that's what I'm trying to play and just capture that.\"","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
