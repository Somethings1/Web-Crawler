It\u2019s been well documented and can be left to others to debate the significance of the blow ups and liquidations that have materialised. That said, it\u2019s a safe wager that few traditional investors will look back on 2022 with much fondness either.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Taking a step back, the direction of travel for the wider digital assets industry is still a positive one. Crypto specifically has come a long way, institutional interest remains high and there are many lessons that have been learned which are being quickly applied by regulators around the world.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To move forward, driving confidence in the asset class and longer-term commitment from institutional participants, regulation is key. It\u2019s very encouraging to see the approach taken by His Majesty\u2019s Treasury in its recent consultation on crypto. It is typically British and typically sensible in its aim of regulating activities rather than the asset class itself.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Whilst there is merit in getting into the weeds on whether crypto should be classified as a commodity or a security, looking to regulate a broad range of activities that surround the asset class, consistent with its approach to traditional finance, seems a prudent first step. Can the application of existing market abuse regulations, anti-money laundering standards and financial promotion rules make a positive impact? Yes. Is there more to do? Undoubtedly.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The elephant in the room is a globally agreed framework to regulate crypto. Whilst in theory desirable, any globally agreed regime would take years and, in any case, is impractical and not required. Capital markets have been operating across jurisdictions for decades, making use of equivalence arrangements and passporting. Just take the FX industry as an example. Innovation in both traditional finance and the crypto sectors moves too fast to sit and wait for any semblance of global regulation to materialise.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">When considering what capital markets will look like 50 years from now, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lmax.com\/about?utm_source=theblock&amp;utm_medium=sponsoredpost&amp;utm_content=link3&amp;utm_campaign=jan23\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LMAX Group<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> views crypto, tokenisation and blockchain technology as the foundation on which everything will sit. There are notable parallels with innovations like derivatives that have driven considerable efficiencies and are a main stay of capital markets. Today, some of the largest exchanges globally only trade derivatives!&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The point here is a simple one.

Let\u2019s ensure that institutions have the freedom and certainty to trade crypto efficiently.
