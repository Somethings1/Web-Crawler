In June, for example, an anonymous Twitter account claimed it would leak thousands of Telegram messages that would expose rife criminality in the sector. Crypto Twitter was briefly sent into frenzy, though the leak hasn\u2019t materialized.","The latest drama comes in the form of a blog post published last week by the recently established website <a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoleaks.info\/case-no-3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto Leaks<\/a>. And while the post has all the hallmarks of another zany conspiracy \u2014 including a passage on why legal careers suit psychopaths \u2014 it also contains enough substance to have forced responses from those in the crosshairs.","The post contains a series of videos obtained using a hidden camera that show Kyle Roche, founding partner at the law firm Roche Freedman, boasting about his relationship with Ava Labs, the software developer driving the growth of the Avalanche blockchain.","Over the course of a meeting in an office and, later, while swilling red wine in a restaurant, Roche discusses his relationship with Ava Labs co-founders Emin Gün Sirer and Kevin Sekniqi, as well as some of the class action lawsuits Roche Freedman has filed against major operators in the crypto space, <a href=\"https:\/\/storage.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.cand.397697\/gov.uscourts.cand.397697.1.0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">including one<\/a>&nbsp;against Solana Labs, its founders, and associates.","Crypto Leaks alleges that Roche Freedman secretly filed suits against Solana and Dfinity, another blockchain operator, on behalf of Ava Labs and its executives. On August 29, Gün Sirer <a href=\"https:\/\/el33th4x0r.medium.com\/my-statement-about-the-crypto-leaks-lies-ef2005da752\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued a statement<\/a> vigorously denying those claims.","\u201CThe allegations on this site are categorically false. Ava Labs believes in transparency and facing the world head-on, not through behind-the-scenes dealing or activity,\u201D he said. \u201CNeither I, nor anyone else at Ava Labs ever directed Roche in his selection of cases. We do not receive materials or information from him, and we do not entrust our legal affairs to him.\u201D","Ava Labs had worked with Roche Freedman in its early days, representing the company \u201Cin a defensive capacity\u201D and Gün Sirer himself in a libel case, Gün Sirer said. But the founder added that Roche Freedman filed class action lawsuits independently, and that Ava Labs was \u201Clivid\u201D when it learned of the Solana case. Gün Sirer also denied that Kyle Roche has any influence at Ava Labs, despite claims in the Crypto Leaks post that he holds a substantial sum of tokens and equity in the operation.","Roche also <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@kyleroche\/my-response-b691563c255b\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">published a response<\/a> in which he claimed the Crypto Leaks post contained \u201Cfalse statements\u201D about him that had been \u201Cillegally obtained\u201D and taken out of context.
