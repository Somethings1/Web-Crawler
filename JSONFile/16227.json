It\u2019s envisioned as a virtual universe where everyone can participate and is not owned by anyone,\u201D Buterin said on stage during the BUIDL Asia conference in Seoul. \"It\u2019s frequently associated with virtual reality, where needs are simpler, akin to wanting a laptop without the laptop.\u201D","Buterin continued, arguing that while the Metaverse is often associated with virtual reality, it's not the be-all and end-all of the metaverse.","\u201CIt\u2019s super useful but not really a-verse,\" he said.","For the metaverse to work properly, we need something that combines \u201Call the different virtual world elements we already have, including crypto, virtual reality, and some AI parts, in the right way,\" he said.","Also, on stage at BUIDL Asia, Buterin said that if account abstraction is going to become mainstream, it must balance security and convenience, something that Ethereum doesn\u2019t yet have in place.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra."],"entity":[{"type":"Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Metaverse","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BUIDL Asia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Seoul","content":"LOCATION"}],"hashtag":["Vitalik Buterin","Metaverse"],"authors":["Sam Reynolds"]}
