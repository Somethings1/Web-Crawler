Having already introduced tokenized community points last year, Reddit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/156297\/reddit-is-releasing-blockchain-based-avatars-just-dont-call-them-nfts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announced<\/a> its avatar plans in July.","The company took pains to distance the offering from NFTs and crypto. The pieces sell for a fixed price rather than being auctioned and can only be paid for with fiat currencies. Its statement made no mention of NFTs.","The strategy appears to have paid off. While some of the Collectible Avatars have made their way onto secondary markets like OpenSea and had their floor prices soar, most holders acquire them through minting on Reddit.","To date, there's only been about 40,000 recorded sales despite the millions of collectibles minted. More than 3.4 million holders have just one collectible in their wallets.&nbsp;","","","Reddit partners with independent artists to release each collection. Five sets were responsible for the record mints on Saturday: The Singularity (98,000), Aww Friends (57,000), Meme Team (39,000), Reddit Cup 2022 (34,000) and Drip Squad (28,000).","Â© 2023 The Block.
