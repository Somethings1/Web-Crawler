Bob Menendez, D-N.J., a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, asked Acting Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chair Martin Gruenberg if FDIC insurance, which backs bank and credit union deposits in case of theft or institutional failure in the U.S., also extends to crypto firms or digital assets.&nbsp;","\u201CIn fact at this time FDIC insurance does not cover cryptocurrency of any kind, is that correct?\u201D asked Menendez.&nbsp;","\u201CThat is correct,\u201D Gruenberg, who was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/186842\/biden-nominates-gruenberg-for-full-fdic-chairmanship\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">nominated<\/a> as full chair by President Joe Biden on Monday, confirmed.&nbsp;","&nbsp;The collapse of FTX should be a \"renewed call for Congress to take a serious look at crypto exchanges and lending platforms,\" Menendez continued.","The exchange took place at a Senate Banking Committee <a href=\"https:\/\/www.banking.senate.gov\/hearings\/oversight-of-financial-regulators-a-strong-banking-and-credit-union-system-for-main-street\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hearing<\/a> on financial oversight and referenced earlier statements from firms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/164553\/fdic-issues-cease-and-desist-letters-to-ftx-us-other-crypto-firms-over-deposit-insurance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX.US<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/160174\/us-fed-fdic-accuse-voyager-digital-of-false-and-misleading-insurance-claims\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Voyager Digital<\/a> that the FDIC had called out for misrepresenting their insurance. Both firms have subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection, with customers locked out of their funds.","\u201CThe strength of the FDIC is the public\u2019s confidence in our deposit insurance system. So if that confidence is put in question, it really puts the system at risk,\" Gruenberg said.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
