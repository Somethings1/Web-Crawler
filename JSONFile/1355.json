They swapped them into alternative stablecoins like Tether\u2019s USDT or chose to exit the crypto market entirely into fiat, causing USDC's biggest depeg since its inception in 2018 and its market cap to fall below $40 billion \u2014 down more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/usd-coin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">15%<\/a> in the last 24 hours.","Demand for USDT caused it to move in the opposite direction on some exchanges, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jespow\/status\/1634413354486988801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1634413354486988801%7Ctwgr%5E79d962548697c7fb6506411e21e815dbb7a6429a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fmarkets%2F2023%2F03%2F11%2Fusdc-stablecoin-and-crypto-market-go-haywire-after-silicon-valley-bank-collapses%2F\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">spiking<\/a> to $1.06 against the dollar at one point on Kraken.","Currently, USDC is at $0.90, DAI at $0.92. Tether is keeping its peg well, while most other stablecoins are seeing minor drops from their pegs. Overnight, USDC and DAI fell as low as $0.88 before rebounding.","The $3.3 billion held at Silicon Valley Bank, which has become the largest bank to fail since 2008, is part of Circle's $40 billion reserves, amounting to some 8.25% \u2014 roughly the size of the depeg.","Following the disclosure, Coinbase <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.pro\/news\/post\/218979\/coinbase-halts-conversion-feature-between-u-s-dollars-and-usdc\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">halted<\/a> its conversion feature between U.S. dollars and USDC until after the weekend. This was due to heightened activity. Binance has also suspended auto-conversion of USDC into BUSD due to high inflows.","A lot of USDC has been burned. Nansen noted that $2.34 billion had been burned in the last 24 hours, while $366 million was minted during that time. This suggests that big traders are redeeming their stablecoins for dollars with Circle.","If USDC were to fall much further, the repercussions across the crypto market could intensify. According to DeFiLlama, if it fell below $0.865, for example, $50 million in USDC collateral would be liquidated on DeFi lending platforms like Aave and Compound (unless further collateral is provided).","It wasn\u2019t just centralized exchanges where the impact was felt, either, with Ethereum transaction fees jumping around <a href=\"https:\/\/pro.nansen.ai\/multichain\/eth\/gas-tracker\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tenfold<\/a> as USDC holders rushed for the exits.","Addresses labeled by Etherscan as belonging to high-profile crypto personalities like Tron founder Justin Sun were also <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0x234872e6df4ae870eeedd8467a7b65caf2f5f00b9bb709f7ec35000ec2127ad0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tracked<\/a> swapping millions in USDC for other stablecoins.","While DAI is a decentralized stablecoin, it's collateralized by other stablecoins \u2014 the biggest among them USDC.
