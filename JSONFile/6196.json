Notable angels include Naval Ravikant, Andrew Keys, and Balaji Srinivasan. The round was led by Metastable and Accomplice.","The firm\u2019s flagship product is a public, proof-of-stake blockchain that focuses on \u201Cusability and scalability\u201D; the two major obstacles for existing blockchains. To do this, NEAR boasts a new <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/nearprotocol\/near-ai-near-protocol-8785c9d32096\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sharding solution<\/a> without \"theoretical limit\u201D to its capacity and a \u201Cdeveloper-friendly\u201D UI to encourage speedier output of decentralized applications (dApps).","\u201CBuilding for [Ethereum] is really poor,\u201D NEAR\u2019s CEO and former Microsoft developer Alexander Skidanov tells The Block. \u201CWe want to attract normal programming, normal developers,\u201D whose inclusion he said was the missing ingredient for mainstream adoption.","NEAR is up against the likes of CasperLabs, which is also working on a truly \u201Cscalable\u201D blockchain and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/casper-labs-confirms-vlad-zamfir-as-lead-architect\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">has recruited Ethereum\u2019s star developer Vlad Zamfir<\/a> as its lead architect in a bid to speed up his sharding work. Skidanov also noted that while Ethereum is also working on a sharding upgrade, it is \u201Cmoving extremely slowly,\u201D with Phase 0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/ethereum-2-0-phase-0-set-to-launch-on-3rd-january-2020\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">set to launch in January<\/a>. In contrast, NEAR has already reportedly rolled out an early version of its sharding protocol, which it says will help \"launch a global movement\" and pave the way for mass dApp uptake.&nbsp;","Clearly, NEAR\u2019s international founding team is not short of confidence \u2013 with due reason according to investor and General Partner at Electric Capital, Avichal Garg.","\u201CThe Near team is a rare combination of engineers who are both theoretically deep and also extremely pragmatic,\u201D he said in a statement. \u201CThey are one of the few teams to have previously shipped a sharded, distributed system used at scale,\u201D boasting former programmers from Google, Facebook and Niantic.","Now, NEAR has opted to pursue a traditional venture capital route, securing funds in exchange for native tokens (known as SAFTs). This is as opposed to an initial coin offering (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/?s=ico\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ICO<\/a>), a public fundraising tool that saw the likes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/parity-ceo-says-polkadot-1bn-valuation-is-a-fair-number\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polkadot<\/a> raise tens of millions of dollars.","The firm, which has been in stealth since 2017, said the new funds would be used <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201C<\/strong>to recruit more developers, to accelerate the development of additional tooling and to launch the NEAR Protocol mainnet,\u201D scheduled for year-end.
