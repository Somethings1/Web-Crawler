The aptly-named cryptocurrency was founded to democratize financial-services in Africa, where traditional banking infrastructure is scarce. Indeed, the project harkens back to the ICO boom of 2017 when celebrities made headlines in the mainstream press for promoting a digital currency fundraise \u2013 drawing the attention and occasional ire of regulators.","In this episode of The Scoop, Akon \u2013 the chief visionary of Akoin \u2013 and Akoin president Jon Karas join The Block's Frank Chaparro and Ryan Todd to defend the project's viability. Akon and Jon position Akoin not as the answer to the financial inefficiencies of the world but as a last-mile solution to financially unify a continent long hindered by corruption and monetary instability.","In this episode, we also discuss:&nbsp;","&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
