These documents were released two years after our original filing in 2021 and only after a full-blown legal fight with Tether, which CoinDesk won in February.","You\u2019re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government.

It tapped a number of banks to hold its funds, and it had to detail its procedures with the New York State Attorney General\u2019s office (NYAG) even after settling the regulator\u2019s inquiry into the company.","Whether the Tether stablecoin (USDT) has been fully backed with reserves has been a question for years. In 2019, skeptics were vindicated after the New York Attorney General\u2019s office announced there was a roughly $850 million hole caused by Tether loaning funds from its reserve to Bitfinex, its sister company. Still, Tether claimed it had patched the hole and was fully backed again in the years following that announcement.","On the morning of June 15, CoinDesk\u2019s counsel with Klaris Law emailed a handful of editors (including yours truly) to let us know the New York State Attorney General\u2019s FOIL officer had finally emailed us documents responsive to a request filed in June 2021.","Among these documents were details about the commercial paper and securities issued by an international suite of banks to Tether; portfolio reports from banks that held Tether\u2019s funds and letters from Tether\u2019s counsel to the NYAG detailing the company\u2019s know-your-customer (KYC) and other protocols.","In the FOIL request, CoinDesk asked for \u201Ca copy of the asset reserve composition details backing the stablecoin Tether ($USDT) for Tether Operations Limited. These details should have been provided to the OAG as part of the investigation into iFinex which was settled earlier this year. I'm specifically only looking for information about what is backing Tether's reserves, including the document Tether claims to have sent OAG in May 2021.\u201D","I don\u2019t really have a lot more to add at this point than what we\u2019ve already published so I\u2019ll just send you to that article.","One interesting detail is Tether\u2019s response. The company published a statement before any CoinDesk reporters even had a chance to dig into the documents we received, and published a second one on Friday after Bloomberg published a story on the documents (also prior to CoinDesk publishing anything).","As of press time for this newsletter, Tether has yet to respond to an initial list of detailed questions sent to the company on Friday through external spokespeople as of time of writing.","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","If you\u2019ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you\u2019d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Twitter @nikhileshde.","You can also join the group conversation on Telegram.","See ya\u2019ll next week!"],"entity":[{"type":"June 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"New York State Attorney General","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tether Operations Limited","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitfinex","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"State of Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"$850 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$USDT","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"June 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Klaris","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Newsletters","State of Crypto","Tether","USDT","New York Attorney General"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De"]}
