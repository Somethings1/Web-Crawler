He then defrauded those investors by spending some of their crypto assets on exorbitant luxury goods,\u201D Eric Werner, director of the SEC's Fort Worth regional office, said in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/press-release\/2023-143\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a statement<\/a> touting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/files\/litigation\/complaints\/2023\/comp-pr2023-143.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the suit<\/a>. \u201CThis action seeks to protect the investing public and hold Heart accountable for his actions.\u201D","Here are some additional details from the SEC\u2019s initial enforcement complaint against Heart:","According to regulators, Heart misdirected much of what he raised for Hex and his other projects to his own pockets.","\u201CAlthough Heart claimed these investments were for the vague purpose of supporting free speech, he did not disclose that he used millions of dollars of PulseChain investor funds to buy luxury goods for himself,\u201D SEC lawyers claimed in Monday\u2019s filing.","Between August 3, 2021 and Sept. 22, 2022 alone, the SEC alleges that Heart used $12.1 million of investor assets to purchase luxury cars and watches.","Heart\u2019s auto purchases included a McLaren and a white Ferarri Roma, while his watch buys included $1.38 million spent on one Rolex, among the four Heart purchased during that time, according to a list included in the SEC\u2019s initial lawsuit.","Heart also allegedly spent $4.28 million of PulseChain investor assets on a black diamond called \u201CThe Enigma,\u201D supposedly the largest in the world, according to the SEC. He used a combination of ether and fiat to buy the diamond from Sotheby\u2019s, agency lawyers said.","Luxury items weren\u2019t the only thing Heart used investor assets to buy, the SEC\u2019s civil complaint claimed. Heart sold Hex through a wallet on the Ethereum blockchain, raising more than 2.3 million in ether through over 1.3 million transactions.","But according to the SEC, much of the supposed demand for Hex was artificial, with \u201C94-97% of the ETH deposited\u201D into that wallet \u201Crecycled through the so-called crypto asset trading platform.\u201D","The goal was to fake trading volume to create the false impression of demand for Hex, the complaint alleged, while giving Heart and accomplices control of a large number of the tokens.","In a hallmark of unregistered securities offerings, the SEC said that Heart marketed his token as an investment, despite not registering it as one.","The complaint quoted Heart from a Nov. 8, 2019 YouTube livestream saying \u201Cif you want to get rich, [Hex is] built for that,\u201D and later claiming that \u201CHex is designed to surpass ETH,\u201D while stating that Hex\u2019s value organically multiplied by 115 times in 129 days.","Heart also claimed on a Dec. 2019 livestream that Hex \u201Cwas built to outperform Ethereum and Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies\u201D and \u201C[Hex] was built to be the highest appreciating asset that has ever existed in the history of man. That\u2019s the design intention.\u201D","In 2020, Heart hocked a reward program he called \"BigPayDay,\" in which investors would stake Hex tokens for yield, which the SEC argues also created a \"reasonable expectation for profit,\" a hallmark of defining a security in the U.S.","According to the SEC\u2019s filing, the agency chose the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York as its venue because many of the transactions took place on Uniswap, which has developers located in Brooklyn.","\u201CVenue is proper in this District because many of the crypto asset transactions described herein took place on Uniswap, a so-called decentralized crypto asset trading platform whose developers are headquartered in Brooklyn. Heart specifically designed PulseX as a fork of Uniswap,\u201D the SEC\u2019s complaint read. \u201CAdditionally, at least one investor of PulseChain and PulseX resides in this District.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
