The airdrop follows a similar partnership between the SDF and crypto wallet provider Blockchain in the past, as well as with Coinbase Earn.","To start, the foundation is airdropping 100 million XLMs (worth ~$6.1 million) to 300,000 Keybase users today. The rest of the tokens will be given away over the next 20 months on the 15th of each month, starting in October. Each batch will consist of 100 million XLMs.","The SDF-Keybase relationship isn\u2019t new. The non-profit <a href=\"https:\/\/keybase.io\/blog\/keybase-stellar\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">funded<\/a> Keybase back in 2018. Now with the airdrop partnership, the \u201CSDF\u2019s mission is to get Lumens out in the world, into the hands of real people. Keybase provides the real people,\u201D Denelle Dixon, executive director and CEO of the SDF, told The Block.","\u201CWe\u2019ve built a way for people to prove identity, collaborate securely, and store cryptocurrency. Because Keybase is doing this Airdrop, SDF knows that its Lumens are reaching real humans in a secure way,\u201D she added.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nUnlike SDF\u2019s previous partnerships, Keybase is not crypto-native, meaning its users are not familiar with blockchain at all, said Dixon. \u201CBy giving out free Lumens, SDF hopes that Keybase users can be more familiar with blockchain as well as the Stellar network.\u201D","Each Keybase user is entitled to receive a maximum of $500 worth of XLMs, according to the announcement. The limit per-person applies over the entire course of the airdrop, Dixon told The Block. Users need to have a registered Keybase account to qualify, a measure intended to prevent bot signups, said Keybase.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nKeybase also has some features on its app integrated with the Stellar network. \u201CUsers can send XLMs to friends on Keybase,\u201D Dixon said, adding: \u201CKeybase has wallets for users and the tokens will be airdropped into these wallets.\u201D","At genesis (the first block of transactions), the SDF created 100 billion XLM tokens. Currently, the top 100 wallets own over 98% of the XLM supply, according to The Block's research.","","The SDF's latest giveaway comes with a condition though. The campaign will run for at least three months, \u201Cwith subsequent months subject to basic success metrics for the program,\u201D per the announcement.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSDF\u2019s stated mission is global financial inclusion. \u201CWe can\u2019t do it alone, and a network by its very nature requires many participants to create the links and connections to get the job done,\u201D Dixon <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stellar.org\/blog\/keybase-and-stellar-partnership\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> in June after getting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/danelle-dixon-becomes-the-new-ceo-of-stellar-foundation\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">appointed<\/a> at the SDF."],"hashtag":["XRP"]}
