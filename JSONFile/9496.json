This transition seems to come with a price. The fragmented form of crypto still results in high fees; the frequent price changes arouse uncertainty and doubt, while security and safety issues are not always fully understood and therefore prevent many from embracing this path. The domino effect in the market after the TERRA\/LUNA crash indicated the exact opposite of decentralization, as there is a high correlation between the instability of cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Regulation is, unavoidably, the answer to these rising crypto risks and should be a fundamental principle not only for the providers but also for the end-users.
