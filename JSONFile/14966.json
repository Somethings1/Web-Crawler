And some of those accounts, the Journal said, engaged in illegal behavior.","(After the story came out last year, Tether's Paolo Ardoino tweeted that it contained a \"ton of misinformation and inaccuracies,\" though he wasn't specific.)","When published, the story included several paragraphs on Harborne and AML. On Feb. 21, 2024, a week before the lawsuit was filed, an editor's note was added: \"A previous version of this article included a section regarding Christopher Harborne and AML Global, which applied for an account at Signature Bank. The section has been removed to avoid any potential implication that AML's attempt to open an account there was part of an effort by Tether, Bitfinex or related companies to mislead banks, or that Harborne or AML withheld or falsified information during the application process.\"","Asked about the lawsuit, a Wall Street Journal spokesperson said: \"More than nine months after the article was published, counsel for Mr. Harborne and AML Global contacted us to dispute the five paragraphs that included reporting about them. Following our review, we removed this section from the article and appended an Editor's Note in accordance with our editorial standards. The lawsuit they filed against Dow Jones is itself replete with inaccuracies and distortions. We take our journalistic responsibilities seriously, and we intend to mount a robust legal defense.\"","Harborne, in the lawsuit, said he does have a connection to Bitfinex: a roughly 12% ownership stake \u2013 the result of Bitfinex's reimbursement plan for customers stemming from a 2016 hack of the crypto exchange. \"Mr. Harborne is not now and never has been in any management or executive role at Bitfinex or Tether; he is merely a minority shareholder,\" according to the lawsuit.","Edited by Nick Baker and Nikhilesh De."],"entity":[{"type":"Harborne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2016","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Christopher Harborne","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Crypto Companies Behind Tether Used Falsified Documents","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Delaware","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Shell Companies","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AML Global Ltd.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"12%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Feb. 28","content":"DATE"},{"type":"March 2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Bitfinex","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nikhilesh De","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Signature Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Feb. 21, 2024","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Get Bank Accounts","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"AML","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Dow Jones","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Wall Street Journal","USDT","Tether","Bitfinex"],"authors":["Sam Reynolds"]}
