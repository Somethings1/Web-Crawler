Until recently, BlockFi offered its customers among the highest yield rates in crypto \u2014 on average around 6.2% annually for those lending less than 10 BTC, or $200,000 at the current market rate. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In comparison, Celsius was offering their customers a flat rate of 2.5% annual yield for bitcoin deposits and traditional banks typically offer their clients rates below 1% annually.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Lending platforms make money by lending out customer funds and collecting a share of the payment, or by investing the funds in other market opportunities. Because borrower demand is not consistent, however, especially during bear markets, some say that the business model is unsustainable.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Before BlockFi reached this agreement with FTX, it had struggled to raise cash in recent weeks despite offering a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/150377\/blockfi-is-raising-a-down-round-at-1-billion-valuation-sources\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">steep discount on its valuation<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. Last fall, the firm raised $400 million at a $5 billion valuation. Now it is attempting to raise $100 million at a $1 billion valuation \u2014 an 80% decrease in value. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On June 13 Prince said the firm would be reducing its headcount by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/151701\/crypto-lender-blockfi-cuts-staff-by-20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201Croughly 20%.\u201D<\/span><\/a>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Given that BlockFi is one of crypto\u2019s largest lenders, the recent developments raise questions about how a change in the way it operates might ripple across the broader market \u2014 both now, and in the future.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to Laura Vidiella, vice president of business development and strategy at LedgerPrime, a crypto derivatives market maker, things are getting more expensive at every level of the market. To get loans, customers are having to put down collateral worth more than the loan itself. \u201CThere\u2019s no debt right now being issued with collateral less than 110% where before we were getting 0% to 50%,\u201D Vidiella told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWe don\u2019t know if between today and the end of the month people are going to be requesting return on capital,\u201D she added. And with these fears, she said, the risk may \u201Cspill over all of DeFi\u201D and lead to less lending, declining value deposited in decentralized protocols and lower valuations.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">At a macro level, said David Weisberger, CEO of Coinroutes, the biggest short-run fear is liquidity cascades. \u201CFTX making this offer to BlockFi takes one more name off the list of potential forced liquidations \u2026 but there are others and no one quite knows when all of the excess leverage is going to be out of the system.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Last week, a number of high-profile crypto platforms <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/152665\/ftx-deribit-bitmex-liquidated-three-arrows-capital\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">liquidated large positions<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> by prominent crypto investment fund Three Arrows Capital. The firm\u2019s apparent liquidity crisis has had a wide-reaching effect on the crypto market.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The only way to restore confidence in the market, said Weisberger, is to have \u201Cmore transparency.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vidiella agrees. She said that one result of this market cycle is likely to be a consolidation of standards, from collateral requirements to how the health of a fund is verified.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CRight now, we really don't have any way [of verifying health] besides saying, \u2018Oh, these guys have been around for more than five years and they've been through a few bear markets so they probably know what they're doing.'\u201D Instead, she says, firms\u2019 should make their balance sheets more transparent.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s likely to start with BlockFi, said Weisberger. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI would not be surprised if one of the conditions of the credit line [from FTX] was more transparency from BlockFi on what they're doing.\u201D<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> The BlockFi spokesperson told The Block that <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the firm is still negotiating the terms of the deal and cannot share more information at this time.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Weisberger thinks many firms are primed to become more open about their dealings. \u201CI think people are going to use [transparency] as a competitive weapon,\u201D he said. \u201CA lender who markets themselves on the basis of opaque methodology \u2026 isn't necessarily bad, as long as they disclose that. But if it's disclosed as risk-free trading that\u2019s a real problem.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The sentiment seems to be shared by other major industry players. On Wednesday, Cumberland, <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">one of crypto\u2019s leading liquidity providers, tweeted: \u201C<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The companies that survive this month are going to do so by getting stronger, by thinking about risk in a more robust way, by preparing for the worst outcome instead of the best.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
