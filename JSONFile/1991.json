To that end, the firm on Thursday introduced a new fee schedule that undercuts cryptocurrency exchanges' fees.&nbsp;","Previously, trading fees varied for Tagomi's clients, depending on the exchange where a given order was routed. Now, Tagomi will eliminate all exchange fees and charge a flat fee of 10 basis points for trades smaller than $1 million.&nbsp;","\"We\u2019ve simplified the rate into a single all-in rate that clients pay to Tagomi,\" co-founder Marc Bhargava, told The Block. \"Clients don\u2019t worry&nbsp;about any exchange fees, those are all borne by us.\"","","","Indeed, the move comes at a time when exchanges are actually raising fees on retail clients. Coinbase and Bitstamp, for instance, increased their maker fees for retail clients from Q1 to Q3.&nbsp;","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, in a sense Tagomi's relationship with exchanges like Coinbase mimics U.S. equities market structure in which brokers sit between large trading&nbsp;clients and exchanges such as Nasdaq or Cboe.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"In the equities world, they turn to Interactive Brokers or a prime broker; in crypto they&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">turn to Tagomi,\" he said. \"It\u2019s not to knock on retail exchanges and brokerages, it\u2019s just a different&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">client base that demands having access to more than one exchange as a liquidity source&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">and cares about the best execution cost.\"<\/span>","The news comes a month after The Block reported on November 15 that Coinbase and Tagomi had held talks about a possible <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/47289\/tagomi-and-coinbase-have-held-acquisition-talks-and-insiders-say-its-a-perfect-match\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">acquisition deal<\/a>. Both firms have denied that an acquisition is being planned. &nbsp;","As for Tagomi's plans for 2020, the firm said it will continue to scale its lending, borrow, shorting and margin services to increase its client base. It also might also support the trading of derivatives, including futures.&nbsp;","Derivatives are a red-hot corner of the digital asset market. Intercontinental Exchange-backed Bakkt, for instance, recently rolled out two new derivatives, an option tied to its physically delivered bitcoin future as well as a cash-settled bitcoin futures. Tagomi didn't mention which markets it would support to start.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":[]}
