However, it left room for an \"in-kind\" process, subject to approval from regulators.","BlackRock likely wants to have an in-kind redemption model that would give the asset manager greater flexibility in managing the portfolio. However, the SEC reportedly favors a cash model that would require BlackRock to move the bitcoin out of storage, sell it right away and then give the cash back to the investor in the event they want to redeem shares.","\u201CCash creation is not the most efficient structure, but the filers\u2019 updates are a further signal in favor of ETF approvals in the next three weeks,\u201D K33 Senior Analyst Vetle Lunde and Vice President Anders Helseth said.","In an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/267786\/january-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-likely-but-ether-is-a-completely-different-animal-bloomberg-etf-analyst\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interview<\/a> with The Block\u2019s Frank Chaparro on The Scoop podcast, Bloomberg Intelligence ETF research analyst James Seyffart reiterated that the <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/JSeyff\/status\/1730327792066195501?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">window<\/a> for a potential spot bitcoin ETF approval was looking like it would fall between Jan. 8 and Jan. 10. He has suggested since October that there is a 90% chance of approval by Jan. 10.

However, open interest in bitcoin perps from crypto-native derivative traders has fallen to new yearly lows, showing no signs of retail froth in the asset, they said.","On the other hand, data from institutional traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange suggests traders there are maintaining bullish exposure ahead of the spot bitcoin ETF decision, according to the analysts. The December expiry is currently trading at an annualized premium of 17%, up from the previous week's 12%.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CME premiums.

Combined with profit-taking strategies, this may reduce CME's dominance in the market going forward, with open interest potentially falling by 50%, they said.","In stark contrast, the animal spirits appear attracted to a handful of altcoins that have witnessed a \"leveraged frenzy\" amid a surge in open interest and price over the past week, the analysts said.
