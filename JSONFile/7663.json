Typically when this happens, they establish a governance system and hand out tokens to their early adopters to help their most loyal users take charge. Votes using these tokens can then be used to determine how the platform develops over time.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yet since these tokens tend to have a monetary value, such airdrops can be very lucrative. Big airdrops in the past have included Uniswap, dYdX and the Ethereum Name Service. Some of Gem\u2019s users have hoped that it will do the same \u2014 and may have spent significant sums of crypto to use the service multiple times with many wallets, in the hope that they get rewarded someday (a process known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/news+\/120824\/vcs-pre-farming-defi-projects-raises-questions-about-ethics-in-crypto-investing-and-aidrops\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">airdrop farming<\/a>).<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Since OpenSea has not yet launched a token \u2014 despite rival NFT platforms such as LooksRare doing so \u2014 it seemed plausible that a project under its wing would also not do so. But Vasa\u2019s message suggests that's not necessarily true.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
