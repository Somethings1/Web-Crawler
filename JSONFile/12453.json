The panel was moderated by Dwight van Diem from BCW Group and included Aishwary Gupta from Polygon, Kevin Kang from Reap, Gagan Mac from Circle, Nabil Manji from Worldpay, and Karl Mohan from Crypto.com. The group of industry experts discussed stablecoin adoption and the key use cases driving it.

Therefore, they act as a digital twin of traditional money, bringing a sense of familiarity to the crypto space. By mirroring the value of conventional currencies (mostly the USD), they also offer a degree of stability amidst the often volatile crypto markets. Stablecoins are favored in the digital asset space for their versatility in a range of contexts, which can be categorized into 'on-chain' and 'off-chain' use cases.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the early stages of crypto adoption, <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on-chain<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> use cases emerged to provide crypto market participants with an anchor of stability and trading convenience. Stablecoins serve as a safe haven from volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether during market turbulence, allowing investors to move assets without leaving the crypto ecosystem. They also provide a more stable form of collateral to borrow funds. In the context of crypto trading, fiat-backed stablecoins often function as one side of a trading pair.

Traditional merchant settlements often stretch up to a month, but stablecoins cut through this delay, offering immediate, 24\/7 settlements. This efficiency is particularly pronounced in cross-border transactions. As Gagan Mac from Circle noted during the panel, \u201CCrypto really shows its worth when it makes sending money across borders faster and cheaper,\u201D pointing out the shortcomings of traditional bank-based rails in these scenarios. This becomes evident, for example, when looking at a recent partnership between <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/business\/2022\/11\/02\/fis-subsidiary-worldpay-to-enable-usdc-settlements-on-polygon\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Circle, Polygon, and Worldpay<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">.

During the discussions, Karl Mohan from Crypto.com observed that \u201CNow we are settling with USDC (on crypto.com visa card transactions in Australia), which means that the average funding from previously 9-10 days is down to just 2 days. Speeding up payments to just 2 days can save a lot of money when borrowing costs are at 5%.\u201D At current rates, this acceleration in settlement times is not just a minor improvement; it's a game-changer. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Second, panelists discussed stablecoins' advantages as a <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">store of value<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> in regions with less stable financial systems.

In line with this, stablecoins are also adopted by some of Latin America's biggest payments companies like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/paxos.com\/2023\/06\/28\/paxos-partners-with-mercado-pago-to-open-access-to-pax-dollar-usdp-for-mexican-customers\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Mercado Pago<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">. These developments underscore the role of stablecoins in providing a reliable store of value and a viable alternative to traditional banking systems, especially for the unbanked population.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Third, stablecoin use cases driven by <\/span><b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">customer engagement<\/span><\/b><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> are becoming integral to new engagement strategies. Companies are pairing stablecoins with crypto wallets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to reinvigorate customer interaction. For instance, Grab, one of Southeast Asia's most prominent ride-hailing apps, has embraced the confluence of stablecoins, crypto wallets, and NFTs to foster a novel customer engagement strategy through its Web3 app. The venture embarked on this technological integration <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/raritysniper.com\/news\/grab-app-stablecoin-issuer-circle-begin-web3-wallet-trial-in-singapore\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">in collaboration with stablecoin issuer Circle<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, to let users create a blockchain-enabled wallet and engage them through digital collectibles. This use case has been adopted by leading brands, with Starbucks, Tiffany, Gucci, and Porsche being key examples. Starbucks, for example, has launched <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/stories.starbucks.com\/stories\/2022\/the-starbucks-odyssey-begins\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Starbucks Odyssey<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, an NFT-based rewards program that aims to build a connected community around the company, even offering the potential for profit on secondary markets. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Key discussions on the above use cases stressed the important role of proactive regulators in facilitating mass adoption. Kevin Kang from Reap highlighted this sentiment, stating, \"I look forward to working with regulators that are forward-thinking because their frameworks will influence what is going to be adopted in other regions around the world.\" Governments and regulatory bodies are waking up to the potential benefits of stablecoins and crypto payment rails, as exemplified by initiatives like MiCA and the Digital Pound. These frameworks are not just bureaucratic exercises, they are essential for the scaling and widespread adoption of stablecoins and the broader crypto ecosystem.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MiCA, which entered into force in June 2023, is a comprehensive regulatory framework aimed at creating a standardized approach to crypto assets within the EU. With a strong focus on stablecoins and consumer protection, it seeks to provide clarity to crypto asset service providers and issuers. Its goal is to create a conducive environment for the digital asset markets to thrive within the EU. The Digital Pound initiative follows a more targeted approach and explores the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for retail use. This would involve significant public-private cooperation, aiming to create a digital counterpart to physical cash for everyday transactions. The consultations carried out by the Bank of England and HM Treasury to advance their Digital Pound initiative exemplify a progressive stance, which according to panelists is key to advance digital currency innovation.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The panel concluded that stablecoins have started <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockpour.com\/report-the-state-of-usdc-on-polygon\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">moving into the mainstream<\/a>, offering efficiency and a strong product-market fit across the various use cases discussed. However, the regulatory landscape still needs to catch up. In that respect, Nabil Manji from Worldpay highlighted that \"The role regulatory frameworks assign to banks will have a major impact on what payment companies are able to do with stablecoins.\" Indeed, as we look to the future, the role of banks in this evolving landscape becomes pivotal. Will they continue to be the linchpin in financial systems, especially in areas like cross-border payments, or will they find themselves increasingly disintermediated by emerging (payment) technologies? <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This post is commissioned by WorldPay<\/i><i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;and does not serve as a testimonial or endorsement by The Block.
