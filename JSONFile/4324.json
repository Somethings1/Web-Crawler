The $5 billion does not include the $425 million in crypto that is in the custody of the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, Dietderich noted. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The lawyer did not elaborate as to whether that included the over $450 million of Robinhood stock belonging to Sam Bankman-Fried, which the U.S. government laid claim on last week as the former FTX CEO awaits trial on fraud charges.&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CWe are engaged in a complex effort now to recreate petition date claim values for every customer. We are building financial statements from the ground up using the general ledger and bank transaction records rather than the previous incomplete and unreliable financial statements of the debtors,\u201D Dietderich said. \u201CThis will put us in the position to describe the financial results of the debtors accurately for the first time.\u201D<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Lawyers appeared before Judge John Dorsey for a lengthy hearing, which touched on the possible sale of FTX entities and whether to redact the names of the firm\u2019s nine million customers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","FTX could sell its core exchange during the bankruptcy process, according to Kevin Cofsky, a partner at FTX\u2019s proposed investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners.","\u201CWe have already initiated a review of a reorganization of the core exchange, and that process is ongoing,\u201D Cofsky said.

Juliet Sarkessian, the attorney representing the U.S. trustee overseeing the bankruptcy, disagreed that poaching is the main reason customers would leave FTX.","\u201CI think they may be leaving the platform for reasons other than poaching,\u201D Sarkessian said, noting that former FTX executives are accused of commingling customer funds with its sibling crypto trading firm, Alameda Research.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","FTX attorney Brian Glueckstein asked the judge to redact customer names and addresses for six months.
