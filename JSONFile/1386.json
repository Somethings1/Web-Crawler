This is an issue of liquidity and duration mismatch in the Genesis loan book. Importantly, these issues have no impact on Genesis\u2019 spot and derivatives trading or custody businesses, which continue to operate as usual. Genesis leadership and their board decided to hire financial and legal advisors and the firm is exploring all possible options amidst the fallout from the implosion of FTX.<\/em>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In recent days, there has been chatter about intercompany loans between Genesis Global Capital and DCG. For those unaware, in the ordinary course of business, DCG has borrowed money from Genesis Global Capital in the same vein as hundreds of crypto investment firms. These loans were always structured on an arm\u2019s length basis and priced at prevailing market interest rates. DCG currently has a liability to Genesis Global Capital of ~$575 million, which is due in May 2023. These loans were used to fund investment opportunities and to repurchase DCG stock from non-employee shareholders in secondary transactions previously highlighted in quarterly shareholder updates. And to this day, I\u2019ve never sold a share of my DCG stock.<\/em>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">You may also recall there is a $1.1B promissory note that is due in June 2032. As we shared in our previous shareholder letter in August 2022, DCG stepped in and assumed certain liabilities from Genesis related to the Three Arrows Capital default. As stated in August, because these are now DCG liabilities, DCG is participating in the Three Arrows Capital liquidation proceedings on the Creditors\u2019 Committee and is pursuing all available remedies to recover assets for the benefit of creditors. Aside from the Genesis Global Capital intercompany loans due in May 2023 and the long-term promissory note, DCG\u2019s only debt is a $350M credit facility from a small group of lenders led by Eldridge.<\/em>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Taking a step back, let me be crystal clear: DCG will continue to be a leading builder of the industry and we are committed to our long-term mission of accelerating the development of a better financial system. We have weathered previous crypto winters and while this one may feel more severe, collectively we will come out of it stronger. DCG has only raised $25M in primary capital and we are pacing to do $800M in revenue this year.<\/em>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I bought my first bitcoin a decade ago in 2012 and made the decision that I would commit to this industry for the long term.
