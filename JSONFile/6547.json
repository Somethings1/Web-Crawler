Nano f\/k\/a Raiblocks f\/k\/a Hieusys LLC et al., 4:19-cv-00054 (D.N.D.Cal., January 3, 2019) [SDP]<\/strong><\/em>","This is version two of a (putative) class action initially filed in federal court in Brooklyn in the fall of 2018 in the name of a different plaintiff (Alex Brola). That lawsuit was dismissed and was just refiled by the same lawyers against the same defendants, but with a different plaintiff. Why would the lawyers dismiss a lawsuit and then refile it somewhere else with a different plaintiff? Gather 'round children and I\u2019ll tell you a tale.","The new lawsuit. The case involves a cryptocurrency called Nano, a whole bunch of which was stored on an Italian crypto-exchange called BitGrail. Both Nano and BitGrail are defendants, as are a bunch of natural persons. (That is lawyer speak for flesh and blood people, not corporations)","Per the complaint, on February 8, 2018 \u201Cover 15 million XRB, bearing a market value of approximately $170 million, supposedly safely stored on BitGrail were \u2018lost\u2019.\u201D (Side note, 15 Million XRB are today worth $13,335,000, using a market price of $0.8893, which I found on coinmarketcap.com. The truth is it\u2019s probably less than that, as trying to sell that much of this particular magic bean would probably collapse the market for it.)","Plaintiff says that he had 23,033 XRB worth $260,000 (on February 8) frozen by defendants and seeks to represent a class of people who used BitGrail to \u201Cpurchase, invest in, or stake XRB\u201D between January 1, 2015 to March 31, 2018.","The lawsuit contains a long section of factual allegations with a by now predictable collection of in hindsight really regrettable statements on social media by developers and promoters. Plaintiffs use this evidence along with allegations regarding voting power to say that XRB is not a decentralized crypto-currency and that, in fact, \u201Cthe Nano Defendants wield absolute control over essentially every aspect of XRB and its value[.]\u201D The defendants allegedly used a \u201CNano Faucet\u201D to maintain high \u201Csell pressure.\u201D When the faucet was turned off, \u201Cthe price of XRB briefly doubled to nearly $0.17, [but] it was trading on an exchange known as BitGrail that drove the price of XRB up to nearly twelve dollars ($12.00) as of the February 8, 2018 loss.\u201D","According to the lawsuit, \u201Cthe Nano Defendants created the XRB currency, they directed XRB investors to place their assets at BitGrail (an exchange that they essentially controlled\u201D and when XRB held at BitGrail disappeared they claimed they had no responsibility for the loss. Not so, says the plaintiff, who alleges that they could \u201Ccreate a \u2018rescue fork\u2019 to protect Plaintiff\u2019s and the Class\u2019 property rights\u201D but refused to do so because it\u2019ll hurt the value of their own XRB.","Plaintiff says that XRB are unregistered securities under the securities act of 1933 and the Howey Test. The lawsuit also includes a pile of common law claims, from breach of contract to breach of fiduciary duty and some equitable claims.","So, what\u2019s the deal with the dismissed and refiled lawsuit? I have to speculate a little bit here. The first version of this case was filed in federal court in Brooklyn on April 6, 2018 in the name of Alex Brola. The defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on September 21 and the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on September 28. The case was dismissed by the Court a month later.","This new lawsuit is filed in the name of a different class representative, James Fabian, on the other side of the country, in California federal court. It also names some new defendants, including an Italian BitGrail entity, and has five new causes of action. My guess is that the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers read the motion to dismiss, decided that it contained some decent arguments and decided to find a new class rep and tighten the allegations in their complaint. The motion to dismiss focused on threshold questions about the XRB being a security and whether or not personal jurisdiction could be asserted over a non-US entity. I\u2019ve run a red-line of the two complaints, and it appears that some work was done to try to deal with these arguments in the new lawsuit.","What happens next? It\u2019s reasonable to assume that the next move by defendants will be to dust off that last motion to dismiss and try again in this Court. When that happens, you\u2019ll read about it here!","The Block<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is delighted to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
