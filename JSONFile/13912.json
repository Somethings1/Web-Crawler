Then, the day before the conference, I overheard two men discuss the metaverse over bagels and coffee.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Technicolor crypto advertisements the size of small buildings populated Times Square\u2019s electronic billboards. An increasing number of street graffiti and stickers mentioned \u201Ccrypto,\u201D \u201CNFTs,\u201D \u201CDAO\u201D and \u201CWAGMI.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Then, the conference began on June 21. What proceeded can be described in one word: excess.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Over 1,500 speakers took the stage over the course of three days, with lavish parties raucously punctuating each night. That\u2019s not to mention the wide swath of New York City over which the talks, events, and parties took place.&nbsp;<\/span>","Although many of the actual conference events drew a paltry attendance, the party scene did not. And hardly anyone mentioned the bear market.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NFT NYC officially began with the founder\u2019s welcome at Radio City Music Hall, in which MoonPay\u2019s CEO Ivan Soto-Wright announced HyperMint, the utility token minting service for brands and creators (although MoonPay had given the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/153119\/moonpay-officially-launches-utility-nft-minting-service-hypermint\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">news<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to The Block before anyone else.)<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ivan Soto-Wright speaking from the Radio City Music Hall at the Founder\u2019s Welcome event at NFT NYC on June 21, 2022.<\/em>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Following Soto-Wright was TicketMaster\u2019s Vice President of Enterprise and Revenue Brendan Lynch discussing the utilities of NFTs for the ticketing industry. Film director Spike Lee arrived a couple of hours later to discuss how NFTs can democratize film funding.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While these main stage talks held ample attention, other talks I attended saw lackluster attendance and audience participation. On more than one occasion, speakers asked the audience how it was doing only to receive a limp response.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It became evident early on during the conference that many attendees weren\u2019t there to attend the informational panels. Instead, networking and parties took precedent. Midtown warehouses with neon-lit exposed brick walls bumped with bassy music, and black-clad wait staff carried trays of drinks and finger foods between throngs of people.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Something that stood out was how little discussion at NFT NYC included the bear market.

One of the core mantras of crypto is the saying \u201Cwe\u2019re gonna make it,\u201D shortened to WAGMI. With so much of crypto culture happening online, it makes sense that attendees would rather ignore the Twitter threads and simply wish to enjoy being in a shared space with other NFT-enthusiasts.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Still, at nearly every party or conference talk, the bear in the room went undiscussed. There were also lots of reminders that venture capital funding is still plentiful.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ultimately, NFT NYC felt like a full-throated attempt to make the case that things in the NFT world are still good despite the market conditions.
