As such, the miner only had a 1-in-1.36 million chance of ever successfully finding a block.","All of the major bitcoin mining pools <a href=\"https:\/\/btc.com\/stats\/pool\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">boast<\/a> hashing potential in the EH\/s range with the likes of AntPool and Poolin controlling 26.30 EH\/s and 22.19 EH\/s as of the time of writing. While it is not known how long the mining node has been on the network, if it was plugged today, it would have taken over 9,500 days for a miner with only 126 TH in hashing power to statistically win the block race based on the current hash rate and difficulty.","Describing the feat, The Block Research\u2019s Wolfie Zhao <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wolfiezhao\/status\/1480915319887704070?s=21\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a>:","The lucky miner in question is part of a solo mining pool operated by ckpool, which means 2% (0.125 BTC or $5,200) will go to the platform\u2019s coffers. The miner will also earn the transaction fee reward for the block which is about 0.1 BTC, according to data from BTC.com.","The solo mining pool allows operations to use their own mining equipment to mine new blocks. But it provides a service for them that offers functions such as running the Bitcoin blockchain on their behalf. Hence, it rewards those mining with all of their rewards \u2014 minus a fee \u2014 rather than sharing all of the rewards proportionally between those using the pool.","The last time a ckpool miner won the block race was on December 2, 2021, at block height 712,217. According to BTC.com data, ckpool ranks number 15 on the list of bitcoin mining pools based on hash rate share with a total computing power of 410.96 petahash per second (PH\/s)","\"<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For the miner involved it's a once in a lifetime chance. Last time a miner this small solved a block on my pool was only a year ago though.
