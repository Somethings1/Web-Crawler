A few years ago, at a time when many of McKenzie\u2019s actor peers were shilling things like EthereumMAX and FTX, he started building a brand as a blockchain scold by going after what he called the \u201CHollywoodization of crypto.\u201D","The actor\u2019s latest performance reached its apogee today, with the publication of a long-awaited anti-crypto book called \u201CEasy Money,\u201D co-written by freelance journalist Jacob Silverman. The two started working together during the height of the pandemic, when acting work was hard to come by. In their first co-written article, published by Slate in 2021, the duo chastise actors Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather and Tom Brady, among others who were all paid crypto endorsers. (Kardashian and Mayweather were later fined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.)","This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.","It\u2019s hard to call McKenzie\u2019s commentary grandstanding, considering so much of what he says about the industry is at least rooted in partial truth. But he does have a habit of making massive, totalizing claims like crypto \u201Crepresents the largest Ponzi scheme in history\u201D and calling the entire industry a fraud. A graduate 20-odd years ago from the University of Virginia with a degree in economics, McKenzie also wanders out into the realm of economic history, and is comfortable enough saying \u201Cprivate money\u201D itself has failed.","You might think such a scold would steer well clear of the thing he\u2019s criticizing. But in McKenzie\u2019s case, he was all-in for a time.","In a recent Guardian profile, the actor disclosed he lost as much as $250,000 trying to short the market. Allegedly he got the timing wrong. The article doesn\u2019t share many details, so we can only speculate but this wager could undercut much of what McKenzie has been saying over the years. In other words, the self-declared paid liar is also a hypocrite.","Betting crypto will collapse is one thing, but betting the industry will collapse without disclosing you stand to profit from it is a whole other game. In fact, it\u2019s essentially the same type of arrangement McKenzie often criticized others for. Kim Kardashian settled with the SEC for failing to say she was paid to promote EthereumMAX, an altcoin built to trade on Ethereum's better standing. Although it\u2019s unknown when his bet was open, McKenzie was a frequent guest on CNBC, Bloomberg and other daytime finance news programs yapping away about the industry\u2019s evils.","See also: NFTs, Celebrities and Perverse Deal-Making | Opinion","In the grand scheme, this basically changes nothing. Crypto\u2019s supporters get to point and mock and speculate whether McKenzie broke the law, and the rest of the world will largely continue to ignore blockchain or look at it disapprovingly. I\u2019m still going to read \u201CEasy Money,\u201D or at least the parts featuring pre-collapse Sam Bankman-Fried and Celsius\u2019 Alex Mashinsky. And McKenzie will continue to walk around as a moral crusader, whose best lines are probably built on other people\u2019s research.","McKenzie often says things like crypto\u2019s allure is rooted in the idea that \u201Cwe all agree\u2026our current financial system is deeply flawed.\u201D People project any number of desires and hopes on crypto making a better future, by tearing down the establishment or building \u201Csovereign individuals\u201D up. For McKenzie, the whole thing is a charade. But, again, McKenzie is guilty of doing what he criticizes so heatedly: oversimplifying the story because he has something for sale.","It is truly problematic when people treat blockchain as a solution for everything. It is an issue that people hire celebrities to hype scams. It is morally reprehensible when some people convince others to put more than they can afford to lose even in stable projects like bitcoin. But to ignore all of crypto\u2019s actual advancements and benefits is also a mistake. There has to be a way of pointing out that blockchain has become a hotbed of scams, without calling the whole industry a fraud.","See also: Crypto Gets Critical, With Bennett Tomlin (Podcast)","It\u2019s a plain matter of fact that crypto has benefited people in dire straits. It may not be the perfect inflation hedge, but bitcoin has helped people protect their savings in war zones and escape repressive regimes. It\u2019s kept controversial, but useful websites, alive for years. It\u2019s helped fund protests and dissidents and parties. Stablecoins are increasingly found to be better for remittances and to get charitable funding to high-risk areas. People have found communities in Web3, and artists a new medium to express themselves with NFTs. Blockchain has added to the body of knowledge in cryptography, and may have a role to play addressing climate change and making governments more accountable.","McKenzie may have the resources to bet against crypto (his \u201Cexpensive lesson\u201D), but others do not. Crypto is a powerful tool in niche applications. Is it an issue when the industry is captured by delusions of grandeur about \u201Cmass adoption?\u201D Yes. But Mr. Hollywood isn\u2019t trying to address that. He\u2019s not drawing notice to crypto\u2019s flaws or workable solutions, he\u2019s rebooting a brand using the attention of a continuously problematic industry."],"entity":[{"type":"$250,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Mayweather","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"the University of Virginia","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Hollywood","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Gotham","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Floyd Mayweather","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"SEC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CNBC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Alex Mashinsky","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tom Brady","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bloomberg","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bennett Tomlin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Jacob Silverman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Ben McKenzie","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"McKenzie","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kim Kardashian","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Kardashian","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"McKenzie","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Opinion","The Node","Newsletters","Hollywood","Celebrities","Scams"],"authors":["Daniel Kuhn"]}
