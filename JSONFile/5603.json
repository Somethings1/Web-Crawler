The particular incentives for the sanctioning were, however, vague.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The move drew widespread attention as the first time the Treasury had gone after cryptocurrency mining. The Treasury\u2019s own headline read: \u201CTreasury takes new step of designating a virtual currency mining company.\u201D<\/span>","The Treasury has not said why it sanctioned BitRiver in particular and did not elaborate when contacted by The Block. However, BitRiver has ties to certain Russian companies \u2014 including firms founded by Russian Oligarch Oleg Deripaska \u2014 that have previously been targeted by American officials.&nbsp;","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The sanctions<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BitRiver runs data centers that host third-party crypto miners, rather than its own mining rigs. This is possibly why the sanctions on BitRiver and affiliated companies have not designated any cryptocurrency wallet addresses.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It was only in September that the Treasury <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/118158\/us-treasury-sanctions-russia-based-crypto-otc-desk-for-laundering-over-160-million-in-bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">targeted its first cryptocurrency exchange<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, a Russia-based OTC desk called Suex. Suex had received huge sums of money from Russian ransomware operators and other bad actors, which attracted attention as the Treasury spent 2021 fighting ransomware.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The sanctions on BitRiver, however, did not mention what was specifically objectionable about the company or its business relationship. The Treasury\u2019s statement instead seemed more generally aimed at the industry\u2019s ability to aid Russia\u2019s economy:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CBy operating vast server farms that sell virtual currency mining capacity internationally, these companies help Russia monetize its natural resources. Russia has a comparative advantage in&nbsp; crypto mining due to energy resources and a cold climate.\u201C<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In a statement to The Block, David Carlisle of crypto analytics firm Elliptic said that \u201COFAC's sanctions action is a pre-emptive strike to prevent Russia from leveraging its energy resources for crypto-enabled sanctions evasion.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Treasury cited Executive Order 14024\u2019s general push against Russia\u2019s tech sector as legal justification for the move amid growing tensions between the two countries. That order was issued in April 2021 and was later <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2022\/03\/11\/executive-order-on-prohibiting-certain-imports-exports-and-new-investment-with-respect-to-continued-russian-federation-aggression\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">expanded<\/a> in a subsequent order after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So is there no particular significance to the targeting of BitRiver?&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For one, BitRiver is at least publicly the biggest such operator in Russia. Company information shared with The Block put total power at BitRiver\u2019s facilities at 300 megawatts, double what it was last year. The firm counts 100,000 ASIC machines in operation at its five existing data centers, with another four under construction.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But as CEO Igor Runets said in a statement shared with The Block, BitRiver \u201Chas never provided services to Russian government institutions and has not worked with customers already targeted by Washington's sanctions.\u201D The Treasury has not publicly said otherwise.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Runets went on to allege that the sanctions were competitively motivated, saying: \u201CRussia could rank second after the United States in terms of mining and other blockchain computation. The actions of the US Treasury are therefore dictated by competitive considerations in favor of US business.\u201D<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Oleg Deripaska<\/b>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, the firm maintains key ties to companies that have fallen afoul of US sanctions, specifically businesses tied to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian aluminum magnate.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Treasury directly <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/policy-issues\/financial-sanctions\/recent-actions\/20180406\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sanctioned<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Deripaska in April 2018, alongside his aluminum company Rusal and energy companies En+ and EuroSibEnergo.
