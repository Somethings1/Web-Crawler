EU parliamentarians appear keen to see those measures take effect sooner rather than later.","Under a compromise privately proposed by the European Commission late during the talks, that strict stance would be somewhat softened for regulated stablecoins \u2013 which appears to have found favor among EU governments, who must also agree before the bill becomes law.","UPDATE (June 27, 06:53 UTC): Updates lead paragraph to confirm crypto is included. Adds statement from Svantesson in fourth paragraph.","Edited by Parikshit Mishra.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"European Parliament","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Svantesson","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Basel Committee on Banking Supervision","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1,250%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Union","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Union (EU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"European Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Parikshit Mishra","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"EU\u2019s Council","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Elisabeth Svantesson","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"June 27","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Banking Regulation","TradFi","EU","Basel Committee"],"authors":["Jack Schickler"]}
