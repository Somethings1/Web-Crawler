The firms include Fireblocks, Chainalysis and Blockdaemon.","The bank will offer direct custody to clients, meaning customers will be accepted based on the bank's own risk assessment, according to Butler. It will then use Fireblocks' Multi-Party Computation technology to store customers' private keys. The MPC technology enables multiple parties \u2014 each holding their own private data \u2014 to evaluate a computation without ever revealing any of the private data held by each party.&nbsp;","This means customers' private keys will be held in BNY and never seen by Fireblocks. This approach to risk management is front and center for the bank, Butler told The Block.&nbsp;","Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis will work with BNY Mellon on compliance monitoring. Specifically, the analytics firm will work with the bank to track where customer assets came from before they arrived in their accounts.&nbsp;","Fireblocks and Chainalysis are the two main firms BNY Mellon will be working with, while also leveraging other firms, such as Blockdaemon. The New York-based startup builds blockchain nodes that will allow the custody bank to process a high volume of digital-asset transactions. Several firms \u2014 including Coinbase, Standard and Komainu \u2014 also use Blockdaemon's services.&nbsp;","The bank's head of custody also noted that BNY Mellon has a track record of working with native institutional players in the space, including Grayscale and Circle. BNY Mellon handles fund account and administration functions for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/111153\/grayscale-links-up-with-banking-giant-bny-mellon-to-prep-for-bitcoin-etf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">since<\/a> October of last year, while also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.circle.com\/en\/pressroom\/circle-selects-bny-mellon-to-custody-usdc-reserves\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">handling<\/a> custody for Circle's USDC reserves.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
