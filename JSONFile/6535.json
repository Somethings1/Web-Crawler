One of the compelling aspects of crypto is the fact that it's an inflationary hedge.\"<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It is not clear whether the card will be a Visa or a MasterCard offering, Perlman said those details would be announced \"closer to launch.\" Other information such as card fees and bonuses, if any, will also be released later this year.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Gemini has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gemini.com\/credit-card\/waitlist\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">opened up a waitlist<\/a> for the card. Anyone can join the list, but once they get the card, they will have to open a Gemini account because rewards will be deposited directly there. Accumulated rewards could then be transferred to anyone and be used for other purposes such as trading, said Perlman.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Details of other supported crypto, the card issuer, and payments processor will also be announced closer to launch, said Perlman. As for how the card will stand in a competitive landscape, Perlman said, \"we're building some exciting features that we're confident will differentiate our card in the market. Those details, though, we will announce again closer to launch.\"<\/span>","Last month, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/86200\/blockfi-credit-card-launching-earn-back-bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlockFi also announced<\/a> that it is launching a credit card in the U.S. in the coming months.
