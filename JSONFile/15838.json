He said:","Coinbase","now has more than 870,000 users, and Maniago was eager to point out that the company has a bigger user base than many official banks. Mint itself has more than 10 million users. It also tracks more than 16,000 financial institutions in North America and supports more than 17 million individual financial accounts.","Although the size of the bitcoin economy is dwarfed by the traditional financial institutions covered by Mint, it is expanding rapidly and beginning to attract more mainstream attention.","However, Mint is treating bitcoin as an asset \u2013 not a currency. This is hardly surprising, as many national regulators and financial institutions view bitcoin as a commodity. Maniago said:","Maniago believes bitcoin and Wall Street are coming together. He argues bitcoin will exist alongside traditional finances despite its somewhat controversial reputation in certain circles.","For the time being, the two will coexist in the Mint app, allowing users to keep track of their bitcoin investments alongside their existing investments.","Mint Image via Shutterstock"],"entity":[{"type":"Vince Maniago","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Coinbase","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"North America","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"US","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Maniago","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Shutterstock","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Coinbase","Exchanges","startups","Wall Street","Mint","News","Companies"],"authors":["Nermin Hajdarbegovic"]}
