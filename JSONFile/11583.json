Players enter a world where they can dress up their brand-inspired avatar named Vivienne and run around collecting postcards that teach them about the brand's 200-year history. The company has added new quests and new NFT rewards to the app, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voguebusiness.com\/technology\/louis-vuitton-to-release-new-nfts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vogue Business<\/a>, who first reported the news.","Players who collect a certain number of free NFTs in the game will have a chance to qualify for an NFT raffle, which runs until August 4 (as one of the postcards in the game reveals, that day is Louis Vuitton\u2019s birthday.) Players have a chance to win one of 10 new NFTs that feature Vivienne in a range of different looks, which will be portable across multiple platforms like a PFP.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Screenshot of avatar Vivienne from<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Louis: The Game<\/em>.<\/span>","The NFTs are made in collaboration with Beeple\u2019s startup Wenew Labs, which also worked with sister company Possible, and minted from Louis Vuitton\u2019s Ethereum wallet.","Luxury and fashion brands have been increasingly experimenting with NFTs and blockchain gaming, with the hope of attracting Gen Z consumers, a group that has an<a href=\"https:\/\/www.millennialmarketing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/Barkley_WP_GenZMarketSpend_Final.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> estimated spending power <\/a>of up to $143 billion.","Last month, dozens of companies \u2013 from luxury brands like Dolce &amp; Gabbana to fast fashion brands like Forever 21 \u2013 took over the virtual streets and runways of Decentraland for the first-ever <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/139904\/inside-the-first-ever-metaverse-fashion-week\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">metaverse fashion week<\/a>. The metaverse, often described as the next phase of the internet, is<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/professional\/blog\/metaverse-may-be-800-billion-market-next-tech-platform\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> estimated<\/a> to be an $800 billion market opportunity, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.","Sources focused on this area contend that digital fashion is becoming one of the fashion industry\u2019s biggest growth opportunities.","\u201CReally what it\u2019s about, when we look at virtual environments, is it\u2019s the future of social media,\u201D said Charles Hambro, CEO and co-founder of Geeiq, in an interview with The Block. Geeiq consults brands on how to identify and optimize metaverse and gaming partnerships.","Hambro says many fashion brands approach Geeiq with the intention of connecting with audiences in an authentic way that meets consumers where they are. Other brands reach out because they don\u2019t want to miss out on what some of the largest luxury brands are already doing.","Despite the buzz around the loosely defined \u201Cmetaverse,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pipersandler.com\/1col.aspx?id=6217\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">research<\/a> published by Piper Sandler, a consumer research firm, shows that only about half of 7,100 teens surveyed in the U.S. are interested in the concept. While 26% of teens own a VR headset, only 5% use it daily, according to the report obtained by The Block.","Nonetheless, experiments have shown promising results. <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Louis: The Game<\/i>, which is free to download and doesn\u2019t require any additional equipment, has had 2 million app downloads, the company told <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voguebusiness.com\/technology\/louis-vuitton-to-release-new-nfts\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vogue Business<\/a>. Similarly, nearly 7 million people have visited Nike\u2019s Roblox store, according to Nike President and CEO John Donahoe, in their March 2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/s1.q4cdn.com\/806093406\/files\/doc_financials\/2022\/q3\/NIKE-Inc-Q3FY22-UNOFFICAL-Transcript.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">earnings call<\/a>.","Gucci, an early mover into NFT fashion, had 19 million visitors on Roblox, said Robert Triefus, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer of Gucci, in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/~\/media\/mckinsey\/industries\/retail\/our%20insights\/state%20of%20fashion\/2022\/the-state-of-fashion-2022.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">interview<\/a> with McKinsey.","On its face, the exploration of virtual spaces and goods is seen as a positive one for the fashion industry, coming after years of supply chain disruptions and fluctuations in consumer spending since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;","But how fashion can take advantage of this area is still not well understood. Even some of the biggest names and players in the space are skeptical about the potential.","Louis Vuitton\u2019s parent company LVMH\u2019s own chief executive Bernard Arnault said in a January <a href=\"https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4482311-lvmh-moet-hennessy-louis-vuitton-societe-europeennes-lvmhf-ceo-bernard-arnault-on-q4-2021\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">earnings call<\/a> that he was cautious about a potential metaverse \u201Cbubble,\u201D pointing to the burst of the dot com bubble in the early 2000s.","François Pinault, the founder of Kering, an LVMH competitor, is optimistic, saying the metaverse will be a \u201Cdisruptive\u201D opportunity, during the company\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kering.com\/en\/finance\/publications\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">earnings call<\/a> in February. Pinault pointed to the potential of NFTs as a way to authenticate physical goods, and the possible role of smart contracts to track secondary sales (a current pain point for the industry.)","Gucci, owned by Kering, has been heavily focused on this front, with a dedicated team working on virtual experiences.","\u201CWhen it comes to NFTs, it\u2019s going to require a lot more time to understand what they represent in terms of customer experience or value-add,\u201D said Gucci\u2019s Triefus in the McKinsey interview. \u201CBut you\u2019ve seen a significant number of brands within the sector saying, okay, we believe that NFTs have relevance, we\u2019re not 100 percent sure yet what that relevance is but we\u2019re going to pilot [this], we\u2019re going to experiment and have some learnings and insights as a result.\u201D","For Gucci, the metaverse isn\u2019t just a good short-term marketing opportunity, he says. In the future, he expects it to become a \u201Cvery significant\u201D driver of revenue growth.","© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
