For now, network data and statements from developers indicate that transaction finality -- referring to the state in which transactions can't be changed -- has returned.","\"Finality has been restored,\" tweeted Prysmatic Labs co-founder Preston van Loon. \"We do not know the root cause yet, but something happened to cause several client implementations to work really hard to keep up with the chain.\"","Data sources for Ethereum network activity show that the issue was experienced by validators. Validators propose attestations as the network processes transactions.","Data provider <a href=\"https:\/\/beaconcha.in\/epochs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Beaconcha.in<\/a> shows that Ethereum epochs 200,552 thru 200,554 saw a steep drop in the number of attestations received.
