The Big Four accounting firm is convinced that for cryptoassets to realize their potential, institutionalization is needed. In a recently issued report, the firm said: \u201CWe believe [institutionalization] is a necessary next step for crypto to create trust and scale.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/assets.kpmg.com\/content\/dam\/kpmg\/us\/pdf\/2018\/11\/institutionalization-cryptoassets.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the 42-page report<\/a>, KPMG identifies the key challenges to the adoption of crypto in the global financial services ecosystem and introduces \u201CKPMG\u0092s Cryptoasset Framework\u201D to help address them. The report was created with contribution from Coinbase plus insights and guidance from Fundstrat Global Advisors and Morgan Creek Digital.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KPMG notes that \u201Ccryptoassets are now impossible to ignore.\" The firm believes that in 2017, crypto started competing against the traditional asset classes from an investment perspective. This development accelerated in 2018 as new financial vehicles entered the crypto space -- security token platforms, stablecoins and more. <a id=\"jump\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/a> Furthermore, KPMG pointed out that established financial services institutions are launching crypto products and services. However, it acknowledges that crypto is still dwarfed by the traditional asset markets with a size of more than $300 trillion globally.&nbsp;<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> While KPMG is convinced that <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">there are real problems in the global financial services ecosystem<\/strong> that cryptoassets can address, there is still a gap between the use cases and development execution. According to the firm, there are more than 2,000 significant cryptoassets, yet&nbsp;<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">many don't actually have a functional product associated with them<\/strong>.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The report then lists some examples of important crypto use cases:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Interestingly, the Big Four firm says that \u201DICOs represent an important innovation, providing new pathways and more efficient flows for capital from a significantly wider group of investors.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The recurring theme of the report is that the staying power of cryptoassets will be defined by their ability to <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reduce friction and inefficiencies that currently exist within the global economy<\/strong>.&nbsp;Along these lines, the firm is bullish about the tokenized economy, which it says will likely be <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">one of the more impactful innovations enabled by crypto<\/strong>.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One additional impediment to adoption is volatility, according to KPMG. It is widely quoted as a significant limitation although it will improve when crypto continues to mature. KPMG believes that the creation of stablecoins can also address the volatility problem (dozens of stablecoins have been introduced in 2018.)<\/span>","&nbsp;","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this section, Coinbase explores crypto's potential to:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase believes <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto will mature in three stages<\/strong>: <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase finds that unlike most other asset classes, <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">crypto did not start with institutional adoption but rather with retail trading<\/strong>. The company notes that <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">institutions have a different set of requirements than retail consumers<\/strong> and need to see a focus on compliance, transparency, and governance to comfortably use and transact with crypto.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">1. <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Compliance with regulations:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto businesses will need to clearly define their product offerings in order to navigate the evolving state and federal regulatory landscape.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">2. <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fork management and governance:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Institutions can handle forks by chartering a governance committee to ensure consistency in decision making around whether to participate and where to invest to support the fork.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">3. <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KYC and cryptoasset provenance:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Fiat on ramps need to comply with existing banking regulations such as Anti Money Laundering (AML), Customer Identification (CIP), Know Your Customer (KYC), transaction monitoring, and other financial reporting requirements.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">4. <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Secure storage and custody:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Transactions are irreversible, which means that institutions must follow the best security practices to keep their cryptoassets safe. There is a dire need for&nbsp;qualified custodians that allows the safe storage of assets in a compliant manner.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">5. <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Accounting and financial reporting:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Neither the FASB nor the IASB have provided specific accounting guidance, which causes institutions to run into accounting issues.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">6. <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tax implications:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Institutions need clear tax guidance. The only clear guidance from the IRS came in April 2014, which said that IRS will treat crypto as property. Every time a cryptocurrency is spent or exchanged, it is a taxable event according to the IRS. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Many key questions remain, including:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">KPMG says that as adoption of crypto increases, organizations will need to prepare for a changed future. KPMG created a framework, which it says has already been applied successfully to several advanced crypto projects and businesses. The framework is designed to help a crypto business scale while addressing the key challenges.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To qualify as a currency in KPMG's framework, cryptoassets must fulfill the 3 basic functions of money and function as a unit of account, store of value, and unit of exchange.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The report says that in order for cryptocurrencies to be usable currencies within the general economy, there is a chicken and egg type of problem that needs to be solved:<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In order to be a medium of exchange, a crypto must be a store of value. In order to be a store of value, the speculative nature of crypto must dissipate. However, many creators of crypto seem quite happy with the steep appreciation their tokens have achieved. Until at least one crypto meets all three criteria, they cannot be considered full currencies.<\/span><\/em>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While cryptocurrencies are not truly currencies today, they can reduce friction and thus increase economic activity. According to Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG, \u201Csome bubbles create lasting value because excess liquidity is pumped into ideas so innovative that they would not otherwise receive funding.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto designers consider three main features for tokens depending on the utility they want to achieve: <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">If all three features are enabled, a token is said by KPMG to be <strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">fully equipped.<\/strong><\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The report concludes by saying that cryptoassets have the potential to increase trust via the immutability feature of the underlying blockchain technology where transaction and other records are unable to be changed. However, given the other limitations present today, this alone may not be sufficient to generate trust without also embracing institutionalization.<\/span>","And so, the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to build, while institutions continue to experiment.","Â© 2023 The Block.
