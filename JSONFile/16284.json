In his letter Woodard took issue with that characterization and said the questions he was asking over months sought transparency about matters such as treasury, not trouble.","\u201CThere is no doubt that community management and governance are hard, but selectively removing the voices of the few tokenholders who want to engage strikes me as a massive step in the wrong direction,\u201D Woodard wrote in the letter.","Arca\u2019s vow to work with \u201Cother tokenholders\u201D could add fuel and momentum to the activist effort. Arca is a major crypto hedge fund with $200 million under management at the end of last year and it has not shied away from governance debates in the past.","Aragon\u2019s director of communications Jessica Smith did not return a request for comment.","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"DAO builder Aragon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Aragon","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jessica Smith","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Aragon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Alex Woodard","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$200 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Woodard","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Arca","Aragon","Dao governance","activism","Hedge Fund"],"authors":["Danny Nelson"]}
