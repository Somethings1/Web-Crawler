The Federal Reserve is weighing issuing a CBDC, which would act as a national stablecoin, and the Biden administration released a series of digital asset reports last week that touched on the topic. Lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee also recently drafted <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/171565\/draft-stablecoin-bill-in-congress-to-require-fed-state-regulator-approval\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a new version of a stablecoin bill<\/a> after months of negotiations, which includes a provision mandating that the Fed continue its study of the issue and report to Congress its thinking on a digital dollar.&nbsp;","\"In my view, I do think we need legislation,\" around stablecoins, Liang said.","The design choices that go into a CBDC are \u201Cincredibly important\u201D and depend on whether the currency is intended for retail or wholesale, Smith said. While Smith, whose association represents major crypto firms like Circle, Kraken and Grayscale, as well as investors like Union Square Ventures and SkyBridge Capital, had critiques for the Biden administration\u2019s digital asset reports, she offered praise for its look at CBDCs.","\u201CI appreciated that the reports acknowledge having democratic values and privacy as part of the CBDC,\u201D Smith said. \u201CParticularly at the retail level, the last thing we do is the government has a database of all the transactions. We don\u2019t necessarily want them to be able to get in and follow every little single thing that every individual citizen is doing.\u201D","Smith pointed to China, a country that is poised to launch its own digital currency, as a cautionary example for the United States.","\u201CIf we look at China's vision for a CBDC, that is largely a tool for surveillance on their citizens. We don\u2019t want that here in the U.S.\u201D Smith said.","Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjijoj1rKn6AhXyFTQIHVqCAl8QFnoECAgQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theblock.co%2Fpost%2F168366%2Ffed-needs-to-answer-key-questions-around-digital-dollar-brainard&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Y-smUMZJ5L8NYkCMkzgkX\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">says<\/a> that a CBDC decision isn't imminent, and that one consideration will be whether issuing one could displace financial intermediaries like banks, credit unions, and other consumer financial companies, an outcome that might upset the entire financial system. For now the central bank is more focused on its longtime faster payments project, FedNow, which it hopes to roll out next year.&nbsp;","Smith argued that by the time the Fed decides on a digital dollar, stablecoins may render one irrelevant.&nbsp;","\u201CEight years later, when you figure this out, we will have already taken over the world. ... Look at FedNow, right? It\u2019s more like FedWhen. Is that coming anymore?\u201D Smith said, joking and eliciting a laugh from Liang.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
