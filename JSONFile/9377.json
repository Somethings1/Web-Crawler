Bob Bodily, co-founder and CEO of Ordinals marketplace Bioniq disagrees, arguing Bitcoin miners are unlikely to fight a moral battle over the issue.","\u201CFrom a miner perspective, removing high fee transactions from the mempool reduces miner revenue. Who is going to actively adopt a new software upgrade to earn less revenue?\u201D Bodily told The Block, suggesting it was very unlikely. \u201CThere is more demand for Bitcoin blockspace this year due to Ordinals, with over $100 million in network fees paid by these transactions. Miners want more revenue, and Ordinals have brought about a renaissance on Bitcoin with massive demand for block space.\u201D","Assuming miners did decide to limit Bitcoin\u2019s data storage capabilities, Bodily argued they would be \u201Cactively fighting a moral battle about what should be included on Bitcoin by choosing to receive less revenue.\u201D Such a move would also undermine many of the benefits brought by the Taproot and Segwit upgrades and remove valid Bitcoin use cases, Bodily said.","Even in a scenario where limitations were enforced, Bodily believes that the demand for meta-protocol transactions like Ordinals on Bitcoin will remain in demand. \u201CPeople will just start storing data in other places on Bitcoin. Sure, it might cost 2x more, or 4x more, but that isn\u2019t going to stop anyone,\u201D he said.","For example, \u201CStamps has always stored data in multisig transactions (like Counterparty) rather than in the witness data and would not be impacted by these limitations,\u201D Bodily added.","One Bitcoin mining pool that disagrees is Luke Dashjr\u2019s Ocean, which raised a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/265120\/jack-dorsey-seed-round-decentralized-bitcoin-mining-pool-ocean\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$6.2 million seed round<\/a> led by Block CEO Jack Dorsey last week to support its launch and other decentralized mining decentralization projects.","Dashjr said he had implemented a \u201Cfix\u201D on the Bitcoin Knots implementation he maintains. However, Knots has been adopted by a fraction of the nodes running the most widely used software implementation of the protocol \u2014 Bitcoin Core.","Ocean is also using the Bitcoin Knots implementation to filter inscriptions transactions. \u201CAmong other improvements, this upgrade fixes this long-standing vulnerability exploited by modern spammers. As a result, our blocks will now include many more real transactions and help to bring an end to the DoS attack being performed on the Bitcoin network,\u201D the mining pool <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/ocean_mining\/status\/1732207450114162855?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">confirmed<\/a> on X yesterday.","Like Bodily, Casa CTO Jameson Lopp expects economic rationality to prevail, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lopp\/status\/1732369194505715972\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">explaining<\/a> on X that miners are now mostly large enterprises with a duty to maximize profit for shareholders, so they will mine any valid transaction that pays the highest fee rates.","\u201CLuke is entitled to his opinions, but I suspect you'll find few folks who agree with classifying inscriptions as a vulnerability,\u201D Lopp told The Block on Wednesday. \u201CClassifying them as spam is subjective: it depends on if you believe that you should get to decide what use cases are an appropriate use of the Bitcoin protocol or if you believe that any valid transaction that pays a competitive fee should be allowed to purchase block space.\u201D&nbsp;","Ocean also <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/SamouraiWallet\/status\/1732584009442443336?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">appears<\/a> to be censoring Samourai\u2019s Whirlpool CoinJoin transactions from Dec. 6, according to the privacy-focused wallet. A CoinJoin transaction in Bitcoin involves pooling inputs from multiple users into a single, large transaction that generates numerous outputs of the same value \u2014 making it challenging for an observer to trace and identify which outputs are associated with which participants.","Dashjr <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/LukeDashjr\/status\/1732597621015949494?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> there was a bug in Whirlpool\u2019s software causing the issue, something Samourai <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/SamouraiWallet\/status\/1732584011803852983?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">denied<\/a>. \u201CSamourai did this, not us.

Inscriptions rely on Bitcoin\u2019s OP_RETURN function \u2014 used to store arbitrary data in the blockchain.","Some argue that these elements are unintended consequences of Bitcoin\u2019s 2017 SegWit and 2021 Taproot upgrades, making inscriptions more economically feasible, and should be removed from Bitcoin. Others maintain that such unconventional uses are an integral part of any upgrade, and usage should continue as long as users comply with Bitcoin\u2019s rules.","\u201CLeveraging an \u2018Ordinals envelope\u2019 and storing data as code in the witness data is surely an unconventional thing to do,\u201D Bodily said.","Transactions on the Bitcoin network have surged at various points this year, coinciding with pick-ups in inscriptions-related activity, reaching an all-time high of 607,000 average daily transactions in November, according to The Block\u2019s data dashboard.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/transactions-on-the-bitcoin-network-daily\/embed\" title=\"Transactions on the Bitcoin Network (Daily, 7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","The share of Bitcoin miner revenue from transaction fees compared to the block reward subsidy has risen concurrently.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/bitcoin-miner-revenue-daily\/embed\" title=\"Bitcoin Miner Revenue (Daily, 7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","However, the surge in activity has also led to congestion, causing fees to rise, with Bitcoin users encountering delays in processing transactions without paying the higher fees.
