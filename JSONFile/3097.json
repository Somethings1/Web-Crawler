Sam Woods, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/prudential-regulation\/letter\/2020\/info-request-operational-readiness-policy-rates\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sent a letter<\/a> to banks seeking information about how negative interest rates would affect them on October 12. Negative interest rates already prevail in the Eurozone.","Speaking at a conference on November 10, Haldane laid out both the risks and benefits of various different variations of digital currency \u2013 including Central Bank Digital Currencies and private stablecoins.","\u201CWhile the focus so far has been on the costs of this disruption \u2013 for funding and credit provision \u2013 weight needs also to be given to the potential longer-term benefits of such a structural shift,\u201D he said.","Haldane said that a widely-used digital currency could have profound effects on financial stability, giving rise to something he described as \u201Ccloser to narrow banking\u201D \u2013 in which payments and credit-based activities are more cleanly divided.","Instabilities in the banking sector often arise from risk and duration mismatches on either side of banks\u2019 balance sheets, he explained.","\u201CIn principle, separating safe payments and risky lending activities could lead to a closer alignment of risk and duration on the balance sheets of those institutions offering these services,\u201D Haldane continued. \u201C","We would move closer to a bifurcated intermediation model of narrow banking for payments (money backed by safe assets) and limited purpose banking for lending (risky assets backed by capital-uncertain liabilities). In principle, this would reduce, at source, the intrinsic instabilities of the traditional banking model.\u201D","&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
