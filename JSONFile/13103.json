And declining as users withdraw due to recent news.\"<\/span>","The tweeted statement did not address the evidence presented to support allegations of market manipulation, uncertain collateral for assets traded on the U.S. platform, lying to customers about custody practices, or other claims made in the SEC's court filings.","The agency accusation \u2014 buried in a document filed in federal court late on Tuesday \u2014 comes from an analysis of documents from accounts held by Binance, Binance.US, and Zhao at Silvergate and Signature Banks.","The banks produced the documents for the SEC,&nbsp; and an analysis of the accounts was submitted to the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/651444470\/Testimony\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as sworn testimony<\/a> by Sachin Verma, the assistant chief accountant for the SEC's Enforcement Division.","Lawyers for the SEC alleged that most of the assets were funneled to Merit Peak.

In total, the agency claims over $12 billion of the $22 billion Merit Peak received between 2019 and 2021 came from Binance and Binance.US customer assets.","Per the SEC's court statement, the $11 billion from Binance customer assets was funneled through another entity called Key Vision Development Limited.","Using Merit Peak's bank documents, the SEC alleges that most of Merit Peak\u2019s money \u2014 $21.6 billion out of approximately $22 billion \u2014 went to a foreign affiliate of the firm Paxos, the New York-based trust company that partnered with Binance on the BUSD stablecoin.","Paxos ceased issuing the stablecoin after disclosing an SEC investigation in February, though the company still redeems the token. In a statement provided to The Block, a Paxos spokesperson distanced the company from Binance and said the New York trust company will \"continue working with all government efforts to bring bad actors to justice.\"","\"<span id=\"m_-7634568265500316902gmail-docs-internal-guid-29e5b2c0-7fff-919e-a9df-526d2c43908f\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In February 2023, Paxos announced its decision to end its relationship with Binance and has since been successfully winding down all business relationships with Binance.

But the agency says that Binance.US stonewalled them for years, with a final response in February 2023.","\u201CIts answers were not reassuring,\u201D SEC lawyers say.","The SEC alleges that Binance controlled Binance.US crypto assets as the U.S. affiliates custodian, despite public assurances that separation exists between the two companies. That information comes partly from Binance.US\u2019s own auditor, which says that Binance held custody of its U.S. affiliate\u2019s assets until Dec. 1, 2022.","The auditor warned that the arrangement made it \"very difficult\" to ensure the company had enough assets to pay customers if they withdrew from their accounts.","\u201CThe audit report did not make clear who has custody and control of those U.S. customer assets since December 1, 2022,\u201D the SEC says.","Those details are included in hundreds of pages of documents, including internal Binance documents and partial testimony from former Binance.US CEOs. On Tuesday, the agency filed for a temporary restraining order on the movement of assets from Binance.US, except for customer redemptions.","The amount that SEC lawyers accuse Binance and Binance.US of illegally redirecting exceeds the approximately $8 billion in customer assets one-time Zhao rival Sam Bankman-Fried is accused of redirecting from failed trading platform FTX to the now-failed exchange's sister company, Alameda Research.","Bankman-Fried has been criminally charged for redirecting billions of customer funds to backfill losses at Alameda, which he also owned.","Before his indictment and arrest, Bankman-Fried \u2014 who at one point accepted investment from Binance \u2014 told a reporter that his company wasn't the only one who used customer funds for their own purposes.","\"[M]ost exchanges did some variant on what we did--just not as big and without the run on the bank (at least recently) and more intentionally,\" he said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/future-perfect\/23462333\/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">November 2022 Twitter DM exchange<\/a>.","Bankman-Fried is scheduled to stand trial in October for criminal charges related to the misuse of customer funds.
