Over the next decade, things could change and \u201Cdemand for alternative currencies, from gold to crypto, could take off,\u201D according to the report.","Benefits of cryptocurrencies such as security, speed, minimal transaction fees, ease of storage and \u201Crelevance in the digital era\u201D could help drive mass adoption in the years to come, it added.","","","Another reason that cryptocurrencies could become the \u201C21st-century cash\u201D is their privacy, per the report. \u201CNearly two thirds of consumers prefer dematerialised to cash payments and a third are concerned by anonymity. These are the two things that cryptocurrencies do best.\u201D","Eventually, inflation could drive demand for alternative currencies. \u201CWill fiat currencies survive the policy dilemma that authorities will experience as they try to balance higher yields with record levels of debt? That\u2019s the multi-trillion dollar (or bitcoin) question for the decade ahead,\u201D said Reid.","Cryptocurrencies, however, need to become legal in the eyes of governments and regulators to become widespread, per the report. This would bring price stability, allow for global reach and see increased interest from companies in the payments industry, such as Visa and Mastercard, as well as from retailers such as Amazon and Walmart.","While many predict the end of cash in the years to come, Deutsche Bank believes that plastic cards could die out as smartphones make physical cards obsolete. \u201CWhether it is through the eager adoption by millennials or the increased digitalisation of countries\u2019 infrastructure, the plastic card could be on its way out over the next decade while people will still be paying with humble notes and coins.\u201D Governments and banks are also moving towards a cashless society, per the report.","Based on current trends, the Deutsche Bank research report further said that the number of blockchain wallet users would increase to 200 million by 2030."],"hashtag":[]}
