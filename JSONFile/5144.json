In the past decade, we have witnessed the rise of blockchain-enabled decentralized storage networks, a kind of <em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cooperative<\/em> cloud storage.","Leading this potential storage revolution are the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Filecoin, with other prominent protocols like Sia, Storj, and Arweave also making waves.","These protocols were inspired by the rise of Bitcoin, which itself was born out of the turmoil of the 2008 financial crisis. People\u2019s distrust in banks and their role in the financial system grew as they watched the house of cards come tumbling down.","As Bitcoin is disrupting traditional banking systems by operating a currency with P2P software and cryptography instead of banks and governments, decentralized storage networks are disrupting traditional cloud storage by operating a cloud with P2P software and cryptography instead of AWS.","Like Bitcoin, the total addressable market (TAM) for this new kind of cloud storage is huge \u2013 potentially several trillions of dollars.","Storing the planet\u2019s most important data in cooperative cloud storage instead of centralized cloud storage is both a mission for the public good and an opportunity to capitalize on multibillion-dollar markets.","The web3 community faces a massive opportunity to seize value by developing and deploying apps in this new storage space. And if there\u2019s going to be a seismic shift in how we store our data, it will be important for people to understand the transformation in computing happening behind the scenes.","To this end, we offer a primer to understand the nascent decentralized storage industry \u2013 its core technologies, economic systems, and ecosystem developments.","Â© 2023 The Block.
