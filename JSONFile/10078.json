That\u2019s good news for the crypto exchange.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yesterday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission hosted a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/148786\/cftc-roundtable-on-ftx-proposal-highlights-barriers-in-clearing-of-digital-vs-physical-assets\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">roundtable discussion on disintermediation<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, largely prompted by a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/137304\/cftc-opens-up-ftx-uss-derivatives-trading-model-to-public-comment\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">much-discussed proposal from FTX<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, though the commission emphasizes that other proposal also aim to disintermediate clearing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">There\u2019s been plenty of criticism of FTX\u2019s proposal. Some have said it puts too many eggs in one basket when it comes to risk along the chain of settlement, rendering it vulnerable to market volatility. Some fear that it will go too soon into markets for physical commodities, which often settle physically, requiring shipment logistics rather than a motion from one digital wallet to another. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Other critics simply don\u2019t want US retail investors touching leverage \u2014 or, ultimately, investing in crypto at all.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Wednesday's roundtable saw all of those arguments play out in the open. But, as FTX CEO Samuel Bankman-Fried told The Block following the hearing: \u201CIn the end, what\u2019s going to matter is the process of the commission and our application.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Barring concerted force majeure from Congress, the CFTC will make its own decision at its own pace. And given how FTX has successfully courted Democratic leadership in Congress, force majeure is unlikely.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As is traditional at roundtables, the CFTC commissioners themselves said almost nothing aside from general remarks. But they have clearly continued to work on the proposal despite the heat from critics.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Indeed, the proposal appears to be a top priority. Yesterday\u2019s roundtable was the first the commission held in person since before the Covid-19 pandemic era. Following seven hours of discussion, Chairman Rostin Behnam quipped in his closing remarks: \u201CAfter two and a half years, we were reminded of the endurance it takes to stay in this room all day.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Behnam himself has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/140026\/ftx-derivatives-proposal-takes-center-stage-at-congressional-hearing-with-cftc-chairman\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">defended the processing of the proposal<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> and promoted the expansion of the CFTC\u2019s role in crypto. Other members of the CFTC seem similarly positive about FTX\u2019s pitch. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">On April 20, commissioner Caroline Pham tweeted a since-deleted picture of herself with Bankman-Fried and Mark Wetjen \u2014 himself a former commissioner-turned-head of policy for FTX.
