Fraxtal's governance will be led by the holders of Frax Shares (FXS) tokens. The network will employ the use of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/141099\/frax-finance-may-buy-large-amounts-of-major-cryptos-to-back-its-stablecoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Frax stablecoin<\/a> and Frax Ether, Frax's liquid staking derivative, for transaction fees. Furthermore, fees generated by the roll-up network could be partly burned or redirected back to the Ethereum mainnet to be distributed among stakers of FXS governance token, Kazemian added.&nbsp;","Incorporating a Layer 2 rollup model in its design, Fraxtal will publish state roots to the Ethereum mainnet for securing the network.","The network will incorporate decentralized sequencers. These sequencers are specialized nodes responsible for ordering transactions into batches in a rollup network. They will be operated by any entity chosen via a governance vote. This feature, according to Kazemian, will differentiate Fraxtal from other Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum, which typically depend on a single sequencer.","\u201CFraxchain proposes a solution where sequencer roles can be auctioned off and rotated, creating a decentralized sequencer base. If a sequencer is forced to shut down, it would allow the next elected sequencer to pick up from where the previous one left off,\u201D Kazemian said.&nbsp;","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
