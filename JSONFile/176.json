Interacting with Web3 applications is exciting and brings out the explorers in us. Once you install a software wallet and move crypto to your preferred network through a cross-chain bridge you are ready to set sail. If you play the game right, the smart contracts you interact with will be audited and will have a solid track record. However, they may still contain vulnerabilities, as we saw with the recent multi-million Solana and Nomad hacks.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"TextRun MacChromeBold SCXW33868336 BCX0\" lang=\"EN\" xml:lang=\"EN\" data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW33868336 BCX0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Staying safe with an insured custodial wallet<\/span><\/span><\/strong>","<span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Security breaches aren\u2019t unique to crypto, and rushing to the exit is not the solution.

To accelerate adoption, we need institutions that offer safe and insured wallets to their clients, tackle cybersecurity threats by engaging proactively with regulatory decision-makers and invest in projects that build a safer crypto economy.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/nexo.io\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Nexo<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is a digital assets institution that fits the bill on all three and has a strong history of protecting its clients\u2019 funds.
