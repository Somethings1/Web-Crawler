The regulations introduced a \u20AC200 million (just under $194 million) cap on transactions-per-day non Euro-backed stablecoins.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With a final vote on the new legislation expected on Oct. 10, executives from global bond credit rating and research firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service, provided The Block perspective on the forthcoming stipulations in an exclusive interview.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As MiCA\u2019s earliest implementation expected in 2024, participants would have just two years to boost euro-denominated stablecoins in the region, potentially making a euro-backed coin a key player in the global crypto and DeFi space, according to Astic. But without enough euro-backed stablecoins, progress may slow down as a vast majority of today\u2019s stablecoins are U.S dollar-backed, he warned.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Although a number of widely utilized dollar-backed stablecoins are engineered and deployed by web3 providers outside of the banking sector, existing traditional finance players entering the space bring with them an existing history of compliance and consumer protections that regulators may favor, Moody\u2019s Head of DeFi and Digital Assets Strategy Rajeev Bamra said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe deployment of non-euro denominated stablecoins is important because it can either fuel the European DeFi ecosystem or it can be a real obstacle,\u201D said Astic. \u201CIt would really depend on whether European market participants are ready to fuel the market with more euro-denominated stablecoins between now and the official implementation date.\u201D&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">With additional regulatory guidance, opportunities will come for known stablecoin issuers to enter the playing field as well, Bamra said. \u201CIf there is a regulatory framework or legal framework in place like the one in the EU, and then we know there are article proposals in the U.S., then that may or should potentially open up the window for all these big major stablecoins like the USDC and similar ones,\u201D he said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For now developers may be stifled by uncertainties over legalities or tax efficiency, according to Astic, who said that frameworks are a useful catalyst for innovation.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In terms of regulators, Bamra said, it can be a difficult challenge to promote an \u201Catmosphere that is fair and equitable in order to encourage innovation.\u201D The primary goals of legislation, he said, should prioritize ease of access to financial services and \u201Censure that society benefits from increased technological efficiency.\u201D<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
