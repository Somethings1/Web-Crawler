While Infura said the ban was in accordance with legal standards and global sanctions and not a blanket ban, many noted that even the ability to block access poses a threat to the decentralization of the ecosystem.","So what are the potential solutions?","The former is essential in addressing some of the concerns laid out by Moxie Marlinspike a few months ago and ultimately in pushing the industry forward to reaching actual decentralization. Marlinspike noted that unless users or applications are running their own node, they are completely relying on third parties like Infura and Alchemy to interact with the blockchain for them.","The latter is something that Vitalik Buterin has been discussing since 2017. The concept of \u201CStateless Ethereum\u201D would help remove the reliance on centralized service providers and would allow blockchain users to access the chain locally in dire situations, especially if they are being blacklisted. To understand Stateless Ethereum, it is vital to understand the problem, as broken down by Ethereum researcher Sandra Johnson of ConsenSys:","\u201CThe Ethereum world state contains all Ethereum accounts, their balances, deployed smart contracts and associated storage. New accounts are continually being added and new smart contracts are being deployed. Therefore, by design, the state size of Ethereum keeps growing ad infinitum. The implication of this unbounded state growth is that it takes longer and uses more space to spin up a new full node.\u201D","The Ethereum Foundation sums up some of the reasons to run an Ethereum node as follows:","As seen above, running a full node allows users to bypass third parties while interacting with Ethereum, but how could ordinary users spin up their own full node, especially as it will continue to become more memory and software intensive as Ethereum\u2019s state grows? According to Ethereum developer Ben Edgington, you can fix this at the protocol level by making state storage somebody else\u2019s problem. By introducing state providers, tasked with the core job of maintaining the history of Ethereum, you can also introduce stateless clients that make running an Ethereum node easier than ever, leading to true decentralization and resilience of the network.","This is all a very high-level overview of a concept that continues to evolve in real time. Ethereum\u2019s Core Developers have been discussing implementation details, which will take place under the proof-of-stake network, hopefully in the coming few months. Stateless Ethereum is just one of the exciting upgrades that will become possible after the Merge, and 2022 is lining up to be one of the most exciting years in the network\u2019s 6-year history.","And a programming note: Finally, I have to announce that this will be my last week at CoinDesk and my final edition of the Valid Points newsletter. I want to thank all of the readers who have followed along over the past few months and everyone at CoinDesk who helped make my job easy. I truly appreciate everyone who has reached out with feedback and helped me on my journey to understand the Ethereum ecosystem and community.","However, all you readers are in luck because Andrew Thurman and Sage Young will be taking over the newsletter starting next week! Andrew is top of the class in his knowledge and reporting around the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) industry and will do an amazing job following the progression of Ethereum. Sage started at CoinDesk as an intern just weeks ago and has already been a tremendous help with the newsletter, taking over the Validated Takes section and covering all data surrounding the validator. Valid Points is in good hands!","Signing off,","Teddy","The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum Beacon Chain over the past week.
