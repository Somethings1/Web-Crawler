In fact, zero-knowledge proofs have been around for more than 30 years, dating back to <a href=\"https:\/\/people.csail.mit.edu\/silvio\/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers\/Proof%20Systems\/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">1985.<\/a>","The implementation of ZK proofs in cryptocurrencies, however, is relatively new. ZK SNARKs were first implemented by Zcash, a fork of bitcoin, and have gained traction lately due to its usage of elliptic curves for proofs that have high-security guarantees and and viability for long-term scalability.","One of the problems BNB pointed out is long delays for transactions to process and finalize. It claims that zkBNB will significantly reduce transaction queues, which is conducive to better functioning applications and a better user experience.","The testnet for zkBNB went live on Sept. 2, and the target for its mainnet launch is before the end of 2022.","Â© 2023 The Block.
