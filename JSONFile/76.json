ZKPs verify data without revealing information about the data itself. Using zero-knowledge technology, Alpen aims to breaking down running large programs on Bitcoin into more manageable tasks of verifying smaller digital signatures to help scale the network, the company said in a release.","In addition, Alpen Labs is developing Bitcoin rollup infrastructure, which is a way to combine numerous transactions into one on the blockchain. The firm intends to release more information on its rollup ecosystem soon, with a testnet launch slated for sometime in 2024.","\"We envision a programmable, scalable Layer 2 ecosystem on Bitcoin as the best place for on-chain finance: from payments to lending, custody, stablecoins and use cases not-yet-imagined,\" said Alpen Labs Co-Founder and CEO Simanta Gautam in a release.&nbsp;","Some of the end goals Alpen Labs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alpenlabs.io\/blog\/alpen-at-the-convergence-of-two-revolutions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">envisions<\/a> include BTC-collateralized stablecoins, hashrate futures for miners, applications offering trust-minimized yield on BTC and overcollateralized borrowing on BTC, among others.","\"With over one trillion dollars stored in Bitcoin, we believe it has significant potential to usher in a better money future, with unprecedented global appeal,\" said Ribbit Capital's Justin Saslaw in a statement. \"By introducing more scalability, expressivity and privacy to Bitcoin, the Alpen team is helping to unlock opportunities for application-level creativity and growth, for a more dynamic and inclusive financial ecosystem.\"","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
