Now, he appears to be telling people to pump and dump one of the coins listed on the exchange.","Portnoy stepped into the day trading world while quarantined in his Montauk home. With leagues suspended for the foreseeable future, Portnoy began buying and selling on E*Trade to pass the time, live-streaming his trading activity on Twitter with the moniker Davey Day Trade Global (DDTG). Portnoy gained notoriety for promoting stocks through the Barstool fan base, regularly making \u2014 and sometimes losing \u2014 six-figure sums in the hours surrounding his live-streams.&nbsp;","Portnoy has publicly declared he does not understand Bitcoin or the crypto space, though he did own some BTC that he remained unsure how to use or access. But his investments in crypto expanded after the Gemini co-founders appeared in his live-stream to help Portnoy spend the $250,000 he had deposited into a Gemini account, with Portnoy putting the majority of the funds in bitcoin and the rest into LINK, the token tied to the decentralized oracle network Chainlink.&nbsp;","In the following days, Portnoy has moved further into the crypto space, interacting with crypto Twitter as well as adding a BlockFi sponsorship for his DDTG stream.

Once he'd purchased OXT on Gemini, he advised watchers to get in on the action, specifically calling on them to \"pump and dump\" the coin:","OXT, the token connected to the VPN-focused Orchid network, is now sitting at $0.57 after cresting to nearly $0.85 from around $0.45 earlier in the day. Portnoy said he purchased his OXT around $0.50.
