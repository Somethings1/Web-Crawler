And even now Bankman-Fried refuses to admit what he did was wrong.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to a February court filing, Bankman-Fried's lawyers asked for the former executive's prison sentence to be between 63 and 78 months. Last month, Bankman-Fried's family members wrote to the court about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/279630\/sam-bankman-frieds-family-and-jail-bunkmate-appeal-for-leniency-in-sentencing-citing-safety-concerns\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">concerns<\/span><\/a> they had about&nbsp;their son being in prison.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bankman-Fried was found guilty in November by a jury in New York of all seven criminal counts of defrauding the customers, lenders and investors of FTX.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Prosecutors say Bankman-Fried orchestrated \"likely the largest fraud in the last decade.\" The former CEO understood the rules, but decided they didn't apply to him, prosecutors said in the memo. <\/span>&nbsp; &nbsp;","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The scope, duration, nature, and sheer number of Bankman-Fried\u2019s crimes, the resulting harm they have caused, the willful disregard of the rule of law, and the absence of countervailing mitigating circumstances render him exceptionally deserving of a sentence that is sufficiently severe to provide justice for the defendant\u2019s crimes and to dissuade others from committing similar crimes, and that will permit the defendant to re<\/span><span class=\"s2\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">turn to liberty only after society can be assured that he will not have the opportunity to turn back to fraud and deceit,\" they said in the memo.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While FTX's attorneys contend that victims will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/275405\/bankrupt-ftx-wont-be-restarting-but-former-customers-will-get-money-back-in-full\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">eventually<\/span><\/a> be made whole, prosecutors argued in the memo that none have received reimbursement yet.<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The defendant\u2019s argument relies on speculation that <i data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">every <\/i>victim may someday be made whole through the bankruptcy. But that is not a certainty, and the defendant has not cited any authority for the proposition that the enhancement under Section 2B1.1(b)(2) does not apply when victims may someday be reimbursed,\" they wrote.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Prosecutors also told the court that Bankman-Fried could decide to start a new crypto exchange, and had \"mused\" about relaunching an exchange called \"Archangel LTD.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bankman-Fried weighed different ways to restore his image, like \u201Cfocus on the fact that the Chapter 11 team has no idea how to run FTX\" and is \u201Crun by a cartel of lawyers,\u201D \u201Ccome out as extremely pro crypto, pro freedom,\u201D \u201Cgo on Tucker Carlsen [sic], come out as a republican,\u201D \u201Chave Michael Lewis interview me,\u201D \u201Cradical honesty on Twitter,\u201D or some other narrative like \u201CSBF died for our sins,\" prosecutors said citing one of Bankman-Fried's Google documents submitted as evidence.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The government's memo also included messages Bankman-Fried received from victims, including from a single mother who said she lost her life savings and another victim who said he and his family left Ukraine during the war and had sent his savings to FTX.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bankman-Fried ultimately \"never owned up to what he did,\" prosecutors said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"He has lied, obfuscated, feigned apology, and tried to minimize his own involvement. Through all of that, the lack of contrition is galling,\" they said in the memo. \"In assessing the seriousness of the offense, the Court should weigh heavily the fact that the defendant has never accepted responsibility, and that too warrants a very significant sentence.\"<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bankman-Fried's sentencing should be between 40 to 50 years, in part because his crimes \"were serious and long-running\" and caused billions of dollars in harm to victims both financially and emotionally, prosecutors said. Bankman-Fried also did not stop committing crimes after he was arrested, prosecutors said, which adds cause to a more severe sentence.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Prosecutors also compared the case to Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernie Madoff, who was sentenced to 150 years and died in April 2021 after serving a dozen years, and emphasized that they were not asking the court for a life sentence.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Here, as in Madoff and many other cases, the defendant misappropriated funds from his victims and put large amounts of the money into assets such as real estate, stock in publicly traded companies, and other more illiquid assets for his own benefit,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Many of those assets are recoverable, and can be liquidated to repay his victims, but that is due to the extensive efforts of the administrators of the bankruptcy proceeding and due to this prosecution, and these recoveries do not affect the appropriate measure of loss for sentencing purposes.\"&nbsp;<\/span>","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Updated at 4:40 p.m. ET to include details throughout&nbsp;<\/em>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
