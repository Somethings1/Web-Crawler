In the past year, the SEC has brought charges against Coinbase, Binance and Kraken, accusing them of functioning as unregistered exchanges, brokers, dealers, and clearinghouses. Meanwhile, crypto firms have argued that it's not possible to register with the agency.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After obtaining its license from the SEC several months ago, Prometheum quickly drew the ire of Republican lawmakers and others in the crypto industry.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In July, the Blockchain Association, an industry group representing Coinbase, Kraken and Ripple among others, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239239\/blockchain-association-demands-probe-into-sec-approval-of-prometheum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">asked<\/span><\/a> the SEC's inspector general to look into the agency's granting of that special purpose broker dealer license.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The association argued that Prometheum had received the license, while applications from other crypto firms were rejected, and said there was a 'sweetheart' deal in exchange for support of the SEC's policy goals. At the time, the group did not present concrete evidence linking Kaplan's congressional testimony in June \u2014 where he stated that new, crypto-specific regulations were unnecessary \u2014 to the approval of the license a month prior.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kaplan has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/268883\/prometheum-gets-the-go-ahead-from-finra-to-offer-digital-asset-securities-clearing-services\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">previously<\/span><\/a> countered claims from crypto firms that registering with the SEC is not possible.<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"By keeping your head down and working within the regulation and trying to work within the law as opposed to change the law, one can achieve success when properly registering under the securities law as evidenced by first the approval for the special purpose broker dealer and now the approval to clear and settle,\" Kaplan said in an interview in December.<\/span>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
