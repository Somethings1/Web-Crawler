He said existing ecosystems, like Take-Two's \"Grand Theft Auto,\" or Electronic Art's \"Madden\" and \"FIFA\" franchises already generate billions of dollars in in-game transactions each year. And many gamers have also been wary.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSo why upset the apple cart?<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/244783\/grand-theft-auto-dev-take-twos-first-crypto-game-launching-on-ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">earlier this week<\/a> Take-Two announced it is launching a new video game on the Ethereum blockchain.

From Take-Two's perspective \"any opportunity that can't generate hundreds of millions [of dollars] in top-line growth is not worth investing in,\" he said. \"Thus it means the team believes that this is a market large enough to allocate resources too.\"<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Sugartown\" video game art. Courtesy: Zynga<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Goel affirms that with major Asian game developers also pursuing crypto gaming opportunities, other major publishers like EA and Activision Blizzard, which releases the \"Call of Duty\" games, will join Take-Two in the blockchain arena. The Polygon executive noted that as the aforementioned gaming companies from the West eventually followed Asian developers into new gaming verticals, it will be the same with blockchain-enabled titles.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Your developers based out of Asia Pacific \u2014 or let\u2019s say more specifically Korea and Japan \u2014 they have always been frontrunners of new technology,\" said Goel. \"If you go back to when mobile became a thing, or free-to-play became a thing, you can see once again it wasn\u2019t the Electronic Arts, the Activisions or Ubisofts that were first to mobile.\"<\/span>","The Polygon executive's prognostications of a shift in the gaming world are supported by recent developments, like Epic Games teaming with Nike to allow players of \"Fortnite\" to claim <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epicgames.com\/help\/en-US\/fortnite-c5719335176219\/epic-accounts-c5719365892123\/earn-achievements-on-swoosh-a16225767406107\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">digital sneaker NFTs<\/a>.
