Globally, nearly $776 million was stolen in 32 separate attacks, mainly on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, according to Chainalysis data.","Along with protecting U.S. leaders, the Secret Service also guards the country\u2019s financial infrastructure. The agency\u2019s San Francisco office has a group of special agents and analysts dedicated to crypto crimes, and said the Bitcoin white paper is \u201Crequired reading for any new agents on our squad!\u201D","REACT is a task force of local detectives and federal partners established by the California legislature in the late 1990s to handle \u201Chigh tech crimes.\u201D The team has focused on so-called pig butchering crypto thefts \u2014 in which a scammer gains the trust of the victim and then steals cryptocurrency \u2014 and says it has recovered millions in stolen funds.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CWe CAN and DO recover funds and return them to victims,\u201D REACT said, noting it has returned stolen crypto to 17 victims in the last nine months.","The Secret Service assured Redditors that law enforcement has tools to monitor crypto as robustly as it does traditional finance. That said, the agency noted that the portion of money laundering done in crypto is smaller than the money laundering that happens in fiat currency, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/system\/files\/136\/2022-National-Money-Laundering-Risk-Assessment.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">U.S. Treasury Department report<\/span><\/a> from last year.","Beyond handling crypto crimes and recovering funds, even finding victims can be challenging for law enforcement.

We had to reach out via Reddit to get the victim to file an IC3 report. That victim will get their money back as a result.\u201D","Some questions and answers were a bit more lighthearted on the forum. One Redditor asked whether law enforcement can track transactions on Monero, the cryptocurrency that uses a privacy-focused blockchain. Another user chimed in, saying they\u2019re able to track it. \u201CCall me,\u201D the Secret Service replied.","Another Reddit questioner asked the Secret Service if it had ever considered releasing a token or memecoin, addressing the agency as \u201CMr Secret.\u201D The Secret Service plugged the <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/usss-sfo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">NFT collection<\/span><\/a> it created and minted last year.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> It features agents in San Francisco locations including Alcatraz and Chinatown.<\/span>","\u201CWe try to learn as much about the various digital assets in this space,\u201D the Secret Service said, signing the message as \u201CMr Secret.\u201D"],"hashtag":["SOCIAL MEDIA"]}
