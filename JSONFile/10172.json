We all need to pay taxes on crypto and aren't really sure how to do it. Getting tax reports can make or break our user experience with crypto providers.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AGG:<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Which crypto regulations are needed to clarify the requirements for tax reporting and compliance?<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JD:<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> A lot. But I will pick two. The first regulation that\u2019s needed is for the tax treatment of staking rewards, which is luckily on the IRS priority guidance plan. That guidance needs to be nuanced, as operating your own staking node is different from delegated staking, which is further different than staking-as-a-service.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The second regulation that\u2019s needed is for the tracking of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ledgible.io\/the-top-5-crypto-tax-mistakes-to-avoid\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">cost basis<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> of a crypto asset through time, as it moves on exchange, off exchange, into a self-hosted wallet and out of that wallet. Regulations must heavily consider operational challenges, otherwise taxpayers and the IRS will be worse off if cost basis gets \u201Clost\u201D in the chain.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AGG: <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Now let\u2019s get creative\u2014What is your dream use case for blockchain in regulation?<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JD:<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Sovereign <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ledgible.io\/news\/ledgible-and-ledger-partner-to-provide-digital-asset-accounting-tools-to-enterprises\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">identity<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> of taxpayers on the blockchain. Today, if you open an account at any financial institution, you have to fill out what we call a tax profile like an IRS Form W-9. In an ideal world, each of us taxpayers would have our own sovereign tax profile that we can share with institutions, rather than constantly repeating the process at every account opening. But this is a dream right now because regulation would first need to allow for that.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AGG:<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> We\u2019re discussing some of the requirements and limitations for consumers. How do you think that unclear crypto regulations create risk for enterprises?<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JD:<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> There's two risk categories\u2014the first one is financial risk. The second is reputational risk.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Companies can face financial risk from unclear regulations that lead to under-reporting to customers, something that\u2019s penalized in an IRS audit. That's clear. There are also less obvious financial risks from over-reporting, which may happen if a company is hedging in the other direction due to uncertainty.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Reputational risk happens when you end up in the news for over-reporting when no one else is doing it, because you shared data with the government unnecessarily. And on the other side, under-reporting when everyone else is doing it can still attract the attention of regulators\u2014and may cause customers to leave your platform for one that gives them tax reports.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">AGG:<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Let's wrap it up by explaining\u2014what is Ledgible is exactly?&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">JD:<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.accountingtoday.com\/news\/vendor-spotlight-presents-ledgible\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ledgible<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is a sub-ledger platform for crypto tax and accounting data.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">We heard from our clients that they need a blockchain solution to track cost basis data for their customers, in addition to tracking their own internal assets.
