Its marketplace, which custodies NFTs in its own Gemini wallet so traders don't pay gas fees, has seen a growing demand for gaming assets.","Blockchain-based games often include NFTs for use as avatars or other in-game objects. Proponents claim that having such items as NFTs allows a player to own that item and transfer it to use in other games, though lack of interoperability between games remains a barrier.&nbsp;","Nevertheless, gaming NFTs are taking their place among PFPs and generative art as some of the most-traded NFT collections. In September, Gods Unchained entered the top five collections by trading volume, generating over $18 million through its game assets, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/dappradar.com\/blog\/dappradar-x-bga-games-report-q3-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">DappRadar<\/a>.","Growing interest in NFT gaming combined with the sector weathering the market downturn relatively well compared to other types of projects has generated interest among marketplaces in working more closely with game studios.
