Centra Tech, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79855 (S.D. Fl., 17\u201324500, 5\/13\/2019) [SDP]<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/strong><\/em>","This case arises out of the Centra Tech initial coin offering (\u201CICO\u201D) that took place between July 2017 and April 2018. The ICO raised \u201Cmore than $32 million from thousands of investors.\u201D Things didn\u2019t go so well after that seemingly auspicious beginning. Three founders are the subject of both an SEC enforcement action and are being criminally prosecuted for fraud in federal court in Manhattan. This particular order grants a motion to dismiss by DJ Khaled, Floyd Mayweather, and Centra Tech CTO Steven Sykes.","As readers may recall, the Centra Tech founders used a marketing campaign in which they claimed they had created a first of its kind crypto debit card that worked with more than eight \u201Cmajor cryptocurrency blockchain assets\u201D and that it would be accepted \u201Canywhere that accepted Visa and Mastercard.\u201D They also had the requisite whitepaper which explained why buying the tokens would be profitable. They also created fake executives with storied backstories and even fake LinkedIn profiles, and used those fake bios in investor presentations.","Centra Tech also paid celebrities to promote the token sale, including Floyd Mayweather and D.J. Khaled. They both used social media to promote Centra Tech. Mayweather, for example, \u201Cposted a tweet with a picture of himself holding a Centra Tech debit card and captioned the picture: \u2018Spending bitcoins Ethereum and other types of cryptocurrency in Beverly Hills[.]\u2019\u201D Khaled engaged in similar social media stylings. Both Khaled and Mayweather have since agreed to consent orders with the SEC for violating anti-touting rules which say, in essence, that if you\u2019re being paid to promote a security you have to disclose that, and have paid fines.","Plaintiffs in this class filed a securities fraud class action against the Centra Token founders and Mayweather and Khaled and also against Centra Tech\u2019s CTO Steven Sykes. These defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the Court granted.","The parties did not dispute that the CTR tokens were unregistered securities sold in interstate commerce. At issue is these defendants \u201Csold or offered to sell securities.\u201D","As to Mayweather, the Court reasoned that with respect to Count I, which alleged unlawful sale of an unregistered security under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act, \u201C[t]he Plaintiff\u2019s complaint fails to establish that Mayweather \u201Csuccessfully solicited\u201D the Plaintiffs to purchase CTR Tokens. The allegations against Mayweather establish that he posted two tweets from his Twitter account related to CTR Tokens. One of the posts urges his followers to \u201Cget yours before they sell out, I got mine.\u201D This is the closest thing to \u201Csolicitation\u201D in the complaint. However, there are no allegations that this was a successful solicitation, that Mayweather had any contact with Plaintiffs, or that Plaintiffs even saw the posts.\u201D With respect to Count III, which alleged fraud under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, the Court similarly held that there was no reliance and no fraud. In addition, the Court held that a theory that his fraud created the market also failed because there was evidence that the market for the tokens already existed before Mayweather was involved.","The Court applied a similar analysis to DJ Khaled. First, \u201CPlaintiffs cannot assert that Khaled \u201Csuccessfully solicited\u201D the Plaintiffs to purchase CTR Tokens.\u201D Second, there is no evidence that Plaintiffs relied on Khaled\u2019s tweets, and (like Mayweather) no evidence that his alleged fraud \u201Ccreated the market\u201D, which already existed prior to his social media posts. As a result, the claims against Khaled were also dismissed.","Centra Tech CTO Sykes also filed a motion to dismiss. \u201CHe was responsible for the content and maintenance of Centra Tech\u2019s website, including the website\u2019s \u201Ccustomer experience.\u201D (Id.) Sykes\u2019s motion to dismiss argues that his involvement with Centra Tech\u2019s website does not make him a seller of securities under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act. In response, the Plaintiffs argue that \u201Cany and all solicitations for the purchase of CTR Tokens contained on the Centra Tech website are equally attributable to him and hence, he was a \u2018seller\u2019 of unregistered securities.\u201D","The Court reasoned that general involvement in a company as a CTO does not make you a seller of securities and \u201Cdoes not establish that he had any contact with investors or in any way solicited investors to purchase CTR Tokens.\u201D Similarly, \u201CThe allegations against Sykes are based on his involvement with the website. The Complaint, however, is devoid of any specificity with regard to the content of the website, when the website was launched, the alleged misstatements on the website, who determined the content on the website, and if the Plaintiffs ever even visited the website.\u201D For these reasons, the Court dismissed all claims against the CTO.","Finally, the Court dismissed claims against Centra Tech\u2019s Director of PR. As with the other defendants, there was no evidence that he was involved in the sale of securities and that any plaintiff read or relied upon his statements, which included answering questions in public forums and posting press releases.","Bottom line\u200A\u2014\u200Aeven though these defendants were involved in a token sale that turned out to be a scam, their conduct (as alleged in the class action complaint) did not make them liable for sale of unregistered securities securities or securities fraud.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
