NFTfi offers lending in wETH of DAI through collateralizing NFTs from popular collections and doesn\u2019t appear to have suffered so far in the recent NFT trading volumes collapse.","","","However, it should be noted things look a little different when the volume is shown in USD.","","","Layer-1s are competing to become the go-to gaming hub \u2014 and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockresearch.com\/gala-games-permissioned-gaming-blockchain-156822\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BNB Chain is in the lead<\/a> by a long shot.

It is followed by Alien Worlds (188k), Farmers World (124k), Upland (45k), Axie Infinity (33k), Second Live (30k), Gameta (19k), MOBOX: NFT Gamer (19k), Mining Network (16k) and Pegaxy (16k).","However, Splinterlands is down 16% compared to last quarter, most likely due to the effect of reward structure changes including disincentivizing log-in rewards and overreliance on starter cards.","\u201CThese changes have flushed many low-effort participants and cut deep into the percentage of users who relied heavily on the free aspect of the game. The present community reflects the active player base for the dapp,\u201D noted Dapp Radar.","The once-top blockchain game Axie Infinity is attempting to change its fortunes following the Ronin hack and the severe drop in its Smooth Love Potion token\u2019s value earlier this year with the release of Axie: Origin and a complete revamp of the game.","Facebook\/Meta is still the primary association for the metaverse among many people, according to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1OpUmzI-Vknl6ukHDcHOEpWS6D1hb7MSO\/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">survey<\/a> of 1,000 US-based gamers by IT company Globant and YouGov.","When asked about companies associated with the metaverse, 73% named Facebook\/Meta, 27% Epic Games and Fortnite, 21% Roblox, 15% The Sandbox, and 10% Niantic.","Just over half of the gamers believed the metaverse would change the video game industry and just four in 10 say the buzz around metaverse gaming is warranted.","And while advertisers and marketers are queuing up to partner with metaverse and NFT projects, potential players are less enthused.
