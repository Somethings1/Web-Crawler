That means the more money spent on transactions, the more SOS tokens one would get.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The total supply of SOS tokens is 100 trillion, and 50% of it will be airdropped to OpenSea users. From the rest 50%, 20% will be kept for the DAO itself, 20% for staking incentives, and 10% for liquidity provider incentives, the website says.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OpenSea users have until June 30, 2022, to claim their tokens, after which any remaining tokens will be sent to the DAO's treasury.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">OpenDAO says it will use its 20% share to compensate verified scam victims on OpenSea, support artists and NFT communities, and provide grants to developers.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Over 200,000 users have&nbsp;<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/dune.xyz\/0xroll\/OpenDAO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">already claimed nearly 39 trillion SOS tokens<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, an amount currently worth almost $265 million.
