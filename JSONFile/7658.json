SparkDAO will further expand its line of features to include real-world assets and perpetual swap yields, the forum post said.","MakerDAO\u2019s Endgame will be completed in three more phases following the initial launch stage, which is expected to scale up Maker\u2019s SubDAOs and launch a new Layer-1 blockchain.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
