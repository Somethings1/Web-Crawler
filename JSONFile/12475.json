The team is also planning to make use of a data availability layer, EigenDA, from the re-staking project EigenLayer, to achieve lower storage fees for the network.","Celo is an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/18155\/crypto-startup-celo-raises-30-million-in-funding\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">raised<\/a> $30 million in 2019 from prominent venture firms like a16z and Polychain Capital.
