According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Ripple offered to cover implementation costs, pay rebates, and make intros to large holders for custody. When constantly failing to list on an undisclosed exchange (although it\u2019s strongly implied it\u2019s Coinbase), a Ripple executive sent an email to the founders that said: \u201CDoes a $1M cash payment move the needle for a Q3 listing?\u201D","Following the SEC\u2019s lawsuit, Bitstamp was the first major exchange to make its move regarding XRP. The exchange announced that it would halt all trading and deposits of XRP for all U.S. customers starting from January 8. There are still four large fiat-to-crypto exchanges serving U.S. clients that have yet to release a statement regarding XRP\u200A\u2014\u200ACoinbase, Kraken, Bittrex, and Binance US.","There are currently basically three options for those exchanges:","So why haven\u2019t these exchanges done anything yet? Mainly it\u2019s an important decision that could have large implications on the business. The vast majority of the revenue of any exchange is generated from trading fees and given that XRP generates 5\u201320% of the total volume depending on each exchange, a full delisting could cut the total revenue by at least 5%.","Bitstamp, which primarily focuses on the European market, generated 18.5% of the total volume in 2020 from trading XRP. This could also explain why it has decided to take the less drastic step and only blocks U.S. customers from trading XRP for now. Japanese exchange Bitbank and Mexican exchange Bitso generate the highest relative volume from all major exchanges\u200A\u2014\u200A35.0% and 50.8% respectively. Bitso is very reliant on XRP's volume due to being a prominent Ripple partner that facilitates payment corridors between Mexico, the United States, and Argentina.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Source: CryptoCompare, The Block Research<\/span>","The least reliant exchanges on XRP trading are FTX, OKEx, Liquid, Huobi, Bittrex, Binance, Bitfinex, and Kraken. Nonetheless, XRP volume was still from 1\u20137% of their total volumes.","For exchanges targeting U.S. clients, there is an expectation that they would act within a reasonable turnaround time to prepare a communication plan as well as to roll out a customer support plan to cause minimum disruption. But standing up to the SEC and continuing to list an asset, which is now clearly considered a security, would be unwise. It would be silly to think that Coinbase, which has recently submitted a confidential S-1 to go public, would want to clash with the SEC.","For exchanges that are not targeting U.S. clients, any decision will likely take longer since they are not under any pressure yet. However, it's not unprecedented that securities regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions follow the SEC's footsteps. A similar decision can quickly follow in South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and in the EU.","The lawsuit will likely drag on for months and perhaps years, but it\u2019s now crystal clear that the XRP market will be greatly affected regardless of the outcome. Significant asset managers are liquidating their positions, large market makers are no longer providing liquidity, and exchanges targeting U.S. clients will very likely delist XRP in the coming weeks and months."],"hashtag":["SEC","XRP"]}
