Prior to the Synapse bridge integration, the only way to move assets onto Canto was through the Cosmos Gravity Bridge.","Canto\u2019s integration with Synapse also opens the door for applications on other chains to deploy on its network, Synapse wrote in an <a href=\"https:\/\/synapse.mirror.xyz\/zOIK4tLukmqYRcGA2gFrv5n5Fkwzr-bV2qnv7x6eODE\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announcement article.<\/a> Canto is built on top of Cosmos, which allows developers to spin up their own chain. It is taking a new approach to scaling by having a natively built-in decentralized exchange and lending market that are both free-to-use for users.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
