As of the time of this writing, it has been signed by over 100 influential members of the Ethereum community, including&nbsp;Alex Van de Sande and&nbsp;Hudson Jameson of the Ethereum Foundation.","The subject of the document centers around the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/02\/18\/money-2-0-stuff-change-my-mind\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">controversial debate<\/a> ignited by&nbsp;Afri Schoedon, the release manager for Parity Technologies and former Ethereum contributor. Schoden, who tweeted a meme comparing Polkadot to Ethereum\u2019s Serenity, received a wave of verbal attacks from some members of the Ethereum community.
