A popular topic in the space of crypto is \u201Cmining,\u201D which is the concept of utilizing computer energy to solve complex problems or algorithms. Once an algorithm is solved, it rewards the solver with that cryptocurrency. The reason they\u2019re being rewarded is that every algorithm that is solved is also helping validate the network of that blockchain. These cryptocurrencies run off a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol. The most notable cryptocurrencies that utilize this protocol are Bitcoin and Ethereum. <\/span>&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Even if the majority of crypto miners are utilizing renewable energy, it\u2019s still consuming a large amount of energy, which can be inefficient.

In comparison, TRON consumes 62,868 kW per year, which is the equivalent of 0.001% of Bitcoin\u2019s yearly energy consumption or 15 U.S. households\u2019 annual energy consumption.

Due to TRON\u2019s unique Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, the blockchain can stay environmentally friendly while conducting multiple transactions at once with no delay.&nbsp;<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-contrast=\"none\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">TRON is regarded as one of the most environmentally friendly blockchains globally, which is evident given its low carbon footprint and high-efficiency ratings.
