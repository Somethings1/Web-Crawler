It was around 11 p.m. local time, about 24 hours after an announcement by Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's CEO at the time, that he would be selling the company to Binance and its CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, his longtime rival. Around ten to fifteen more employees joined the meeting via teleconference in the Bahamas, where it was 10 a.m.&nbsp;","In the meeting, seemingly unburdened by the prospect of CZ's bailout, Ellison told her employees exactly what, in her view, went wrong: Alameda had borrowed large amounts of capital via open-term loans from third-party lenders in order to buy out Binance's original equity stake in FTX and make a series of illiquid venture investments. When those loans were called following the crypto market downturn in May 2022, they borrowed from FTX customers in order to repay their lenders, causing the shortfall in deposits. When asked who decided that borrowed customer funds be used to repay the loans, Ellison responded, \"Sam, I guess.\"&nbsp;","Unknown to Ellison, the meeting was being recorded. Though the existence of the recording has been known since <a href=\"https:\/\/storage.courtlistener.com\/recap\/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940\/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.204.0.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a court filing<\/a> in August, clips from the recording of the meeting were played in court yesterday for the first time. They were made available to The Block by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.","<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-21483-13\" preload=\"none\" controls=\"controls\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><source type=\"audio\/mpeg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ClipA.mp3?_=13\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ClipA.mp3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ClipA.mp3<\/a><\/audio>","Transcript:&nbsp;","CAROLINE ELLISON: Okay, let's get started, I guess. We have a bunch of people. Yeah, I guess I'll just start by saying some stuff. And then you guys can feel free to ask questions. Um...Yeah. So I guess you guys have probably seen a lot of what's happening on, I don't know, Slack and Twitter. But I can just, like, start by giving a general overview of the situation. I mean, the basic story here is that starting last year, Alameda was kind of borrowing a bunch of money via open-term loans and use that to make various illiquid investments.","So, like, a bunch of FIX and FTX US equity. A bunch of like other ventures, investments, et cetera. Then with crypto being down, the crash, the -- like, credit crunch this year, most of Alameda's loans got called. And in order to, like, meet those loan recalls, we ended up like borrowing a bunch of funds on FTX which led to FTX having a shortfall in user funds. And so, with the -- once there started being, like FUD about this and users started withdrawing funds, they kind of eventually were realizing that they were unable to -- not going to be able to meet, like, the continued withdrawal pressure.","<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-21483-14\" preload=\"none\" controls=\"controls\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><source type=\"audio\/mpeg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ClipB.mp3?_=14\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ClipB.mp3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ClipB.mp3<\/a><\/audio>","CHRISTIAN DRAPPI: Was there, like, a plan to eventually, pay, the -- suppose this didn't happen. Right. Like -- was there in the road map of, like, oh, when are we gonna actually, like, try to, like, pay this back and, like, make FIX, like, users not fucked if this didn't happen.","CAROLINE ELLISON: Um-hum.","DRAPPI: Or like -- was this, like, a --","ELLISON: Yeah.","DRAPPI: Whatever kind of thing.","ELLISON: I think -- yeah, basically, FIX was trying to raise in order to do this. But yeah, after the crash, no one wanted to invest and I don't know. I guess there's, like, a question of, like, should you try raising, like, a big -- like, a -- you know, steeply, like, discounted valuation or would that, just, you know, make people freak out more or something. I don't know. Obviously, with respect to the plan of wait around for several months and, like -- for the market environment to get better and then raise did not work out.","<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-21483-15\" preload=\"none\" controls=\"controls\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><source type=\"audio\/mpeg\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ClipC.mp3?_=15\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ClipC.mp3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ClipC.mp3<\/a><\/audio>","CHRISTIAN DRAPPI: So the biggest factor is effectively the loan we have in FIX.","CAROLINE ELLISON: Yeah.","DRAPPI: And was that collateralized by -- was that, like, basically officially done through the spot margin book or was there some, like, extra thing that kinda powered that?","ELLISON: Uh --","DRAPPI: Because I feel like - -","ELLISON:","It was -- yeah, it was not through the normal spot margin.","DRAPPI: Oh.

And those were like used mostly to buy sort of illiquid assets.","DAVID NYESTE: What were, like, the biggest items that (unintelligible), the biggest illiquid investments?","ELLISON: What did you say?","NYESTE: What were the biggest illiquid investments that we made? I know that if you answer this question it's going to give us an idea for what the hole is.","ELLISON: Yeah, I mean, I think, like, FTX equity there was like the FTX equity that we bought back from Binance and then also","Unidentified Male: That was 2.1 bil, right?","ELLISON: Yeah, and then also some other FTX equity, that was, like, another billion or something maybe.
