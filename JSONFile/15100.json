Stallman went on to launch the free software movement, and Gates gladly assumed the role of corporate software antihero.","I was watching \"Revolution OS,\" a history of open-source computing, the other day and couldn\u2019t help but chuckle when the narrator read Gates\u2019 scathing \u201COpen Letter to Hobbyists.\u201D Microsoft had released software for the very early Altair 8800 and was accusing PC hobbyists of illegally copying and distributing that software. Gates wrote:","\u201CHardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who work on it get paid? Is this fair?\u201D","Stallman was on a different trajectory. In 1984, he quit his job at MIT to focus on building a free and open operating system. The goal was to create an alternative to proprietary systems like Unix. His project was aptly named GNU, a recursive acronym for \u201CGnu\u2019s not Unix.\u201D","This article is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.","Stallman was all too familiar with Gates\u2019 assertion that developers couldn\u2019t make money from free and open software. In 1985, he released his famous GNU Manifesto and countered Gates\u2019 argument head-on. Under the section \u201CProgrammers need to make a living somehow,\u201D Stallman wrote:","\u201CPeople with new ideas could distribute programs as freeware, asking for donations from satisfied users.\u201D","Mike Schmidt, co-founder and executive director of Brink, an organization that funds Bitcoin development, explains that Bitcoin developers don\u2019t just crank out code. They test, review and contribute in many other ways. In fact, a deep passion for contributing is pivotal if you want to join the Bitcoin family.","Schmidt compares the process of becoming a Bitcoin developer to a funnel. At the top, you have acclimatization. This is where one becomes intimately familiar with key areas current developers are working on. A great starting point is subscribing to the weekly Bitcoin Optech newsletter, which aggregates information from developer mailings lists, pull requests and key discussions.","Next, you have education. Schmidt recommends Bitcoin coding boot camps like Jimmy Song\u2019s Programming Blockchain seminars, or Lisa Neigut\u2019s Base58 course. There\u2019s also something called the PR Review Club where budding developers can sharpen their pull request reviewing skills.","The bottom of the funnel is where developers become comfortable with the inner workings of the Bitcoin Core codebase. To be clear, there\u2019s no magical line separating each stage, and this funnel concept is only an analogy. In fact, some developers like Larry Ruane entered the funnel at an intermediate stage. Ruane is a Bitcoin Core developer on a full-time Brink grant. He graduated with a master of science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois.","\u201CWhen I first heard of Bitcoin in 2013, I was mostly fascinated by the trustless consensus mechanism. I didn't think such a thing was possible, especially so simply,\" Ruane said.","Ruane had already worked on consensus protocols like Paxos, but something about Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus was alluring to him. In fact, he went on a brief foray into hobbyist bitcoin mining before getting hired to work on Zcash.","\u201CI got a job at the Electric Coin Company, creators of Zcash, which is a code fork of Bitcoin Core. I happened to find a minor bug in Zcash and discovered it also existed \u2018upstream.\u2019 So I opened my first Bitcoin Core pull request to fix the bug. It merged quickly, so I assumed it was pretty easy to get changes into Bitcoin Core. (This belief was naive.),\u201D Ruane said.","That pull request triggered a flywheel effect. Ruane gradually increased his contributions until Brink awarded him a small grant to work on Bitcoin Core one 10-hour day a week.","\u201CI proposed to help with pull request review because that's a critical need right now. It also helps to show your enthusiasm and dedication. You're much more likely to succeed if you've already put in the effort and built a reputation,\" he said.","After proving himself and paying it forward, he was awarded a full-time grant. I got the sense that Brink's grant application process is both challenging and competitive, so I asked Ruane what made his grant application stand out.","\u201CI was lucky to have help from more experienced developers. I revised my application many times. I think it helps to be as specific as possible and to emphasize how your work will advance Bitcoin,\" he said.","Brink\u2019s fellowship and grant programs are 100% donor funded. Donors range from large crypto exchanges like Coinbase to smaller startups like BtcTurk. Brink isn\u2019t the only player in the Bitcoin funding network, and Schmidt was quick to point out how diverse that network is.","\u201CThere's Chaincode [Labs] that employs a bunch of Bitcoin developers. They\u2019re in New York, and they have a nice office up there. There's Blockstream that has a bunch of folks specializing in crypto. So \u2018crypto\u2019 meaning cryptography. They fund a lot of the cryptographers and mathematicians doing research and development in the space.\u201D","Those funding efforts are global in scale. Schmidt gave the example of Qala, a Bitcoin funding program supporting the next wave of Bitcoin and Lightning developers in Africa. Qala is funded by some of the same organizations that donate to Brink. In fact, prior to the current bear market, many companies in the sector were increasing their funding activities.","\u201CA lot of exchanges are trying to spin up or have spun up their own developer funding divisions, the first of which is BitMEX. They\u2019ve funded different developers over the years, and they do all of that in-house. There\u2019s someone there whose job is to vet applications and go through them to make sure the right people are getting funded,\" Schmidt said.","Back in 2020, Coinbase started its Crypto Community Fund with the initial goal of funding Bitcoin Core development. Gemini recently announced Superlunar, which provides grants and sponsorships to contributors in the market.","The Human Rights Foundation (HRF) has donated over $750,000 to more than 20 Bitcoin-related projects via its Bitcoin Development Fund. HRF\u2019s vision is to promote the use of Bitcoin as a financial tool for human rights activists.","\u201CIt's a much richer landscape than it has been in years past, which is good, but there's still a lot to do,\" Schmidt said.","Read more: Human Rights Foundation Gives Out $210K in Bitcoin Development Grants","Stallman famously said: \u201CFree software is a matter of freedom, not price.\u201D That\u2019s my favorite Stallman quote. I bring up that quote because I sensed a similar ethos when I asked Ruane for his advice to aspiring developers.","\u201CThe most important piece of advice I have is to first look inward,\u201D he said.","The Crypto Jobs Boom","It may be a bear market, but there are still plenty of jobs to be had at crypto companies.","'We're Freaking DAOing It': The People Who Think DAOs Are the Future of Work","Meet the pioneers who work at decentralized autonomous organizations.","Chase Chapman on DAOs and Professional Polyamory","\"There's a lot of value in talent that doesn't want to be held down by one organization,\u201D Orca Protocol\u2019s Chase Chapman says.","Payroll, Web3 and the $62B Opportunity","Crypto can make it faster and cheaper to pay workers.","You\u2019re Hiring Wrong: Do It More Like Web3","By adopting a more open, fluid model, traditional firms would find it easier to attract talent and end up with a more passionate, engaged workforce.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"1984","content":"DATE"},{"type":"University of Illinois","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gates","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2013","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Brink","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1985","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Artificial Intelligence Lab","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Human Rights Foundation (HRF","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Human Rights Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"100%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Chapman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Bitcoin Development Grants","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Mike Schmidt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Electric Coin Company","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"1971","content":"DATE"},{"type":"8800","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Lisa Neigut","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Blockstream","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$210K","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"GNU","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Gnu","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Schmidt","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"MIT","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"PR Review Club","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Ruane","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$62B Opportunity","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Richard Stallman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Stallman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Africa","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Crypto Community Fund","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bitcoin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$750,000","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Larry Ruane","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Future of Work Week","Bitcoin","Developer Grants"],"authors":["Frederick Munawa"]}
