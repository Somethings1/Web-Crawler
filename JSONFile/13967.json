Discussions and news surrounding what\u2019s considered the world\u2019s most advanced CBDC reached a peak when the country <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlanticcouncil.org\/blogs\/econographics\/a-report-card-on-chinas-central-bank-digital-currency-the-e-cny\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">flexed its digital currency muscle<\/a> at the Beijing Winter Olympics the following month.

circulation reached 13.61 billion yuan ($2 billion).","And yet the hype around it has largely vanished.","Richard Turrin, a Shanghai-based fintech consultant, said there\u2019s less news about e-CNY compared to two years ago because the PBOC is now doing the \u201Chard or dirty work,\u201D which is \u201Cfundamentally less newsworthy\u201D than the launch of pilots.","\u201CIt takes a lot more to build this ubiquitous national digital currency than it does to launch a cryptocurrency, which you turn on overnight, because you have to make sure it works first time and every time for every user,\u201D Turrin added.","Youwei Yang, chief economist of Bit Mining, agreed that the e-CNY hype has faded \u201Ccompared to the initial launch of the pilot program as it faces some challenges.\u201D","Key among those challenges in testing the e-CNY include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.internationalaffairs.org.au\/australianoutlook\/the-e-cny-implications-for-the-future-of-digital-china\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">privacy concerns<\/a>, user habit and interoperability with existing payment systems such as Ant Group\u2019s Alipay and Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay, Yang added. \u201CAddressing these challenges is crucial for expanding the use cases, building trust and driving wider adoption of e-CNY in the future.\u201D","Since the inception of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2021-07\/17\/c_1310065964.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">digital yuan pilots<\/a> in late 2019, the PBOC has expanded its digital yuan trial to at least 26 locations in 17 provincial-level cities and regions, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Suzhou, state media Xinhua <a href=\"http:\/\/www.news.cn\/fortune\/2023-04\/08\/c_1129503697.htm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a> in April.","While the hype surrounding the e-CNY may have died down, Matteo Giovannini, a senior finance manager at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/sergeiklebnikov\/2022\/05\/12\/the-worlds-largest-banks-2022-banks-face-challenging-economic-environment-but-could-benefit-from-fed-rate-hikes\/?sh=443b9b517e67\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">largest state-owned commercial bank<\/a> by assets, said that momentum has \u201Cnot completely vanished,\u201D adding that \u201Cprobably right now it is not on top of mind of the central bank.\u201D","\u201CDespite persistent low adoption rates, the e-CNY is by far the world\u2019s largest CBDC pilot in terms of the amount of currency in circulation and number of users,\u201D Giovannini said.","Business-to-business promotion may be the key focus area for the PBOC moving forward, said Stanley Chao, managing director of U.S.-based business strategy firm All In Consulting.&nbsp;","\u201CThe PBOC tried to push and market the e-CNY from a retail perspective asking consumers to buy from stores using e-CNY,\u201D Chao, who often works with Chinese businesses, said. \u201CThat has somewhat backfired, and I think we'll see the PBOC now marketing the e-CNY from the business-to-business perspective as well as pushing banks to possibly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/news\/2023-05-14\/why-china-digital-currency-e-cny-concerning-yuan-rmb\/102328578\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">pay salaries<\/a> via the e-CNY, thereby compelling more retail to accept the digital currency.\u201D","Earlier this month, DBS Bank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dbs.com\/newsroom\/DBS_launches_e_CNY_merchant_collection_solution_for_mainland_businesses_to_receive_CBDC_payments_completes_first_client_transaction\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched an e-CNY initiative<\/a> that allows corporate clients to receive payments in digital yuan, claiming it is one of the first foreign banks to do so on the Chinese mainland.","\u201CIt's a large milestone for the e-CNY that a large, well-known, highly capitalized bank such as DBS decides to use the e-currency,\u201D Chao added. \u201C[The fact] that the bank is based in a democratic country trying to stay neutral in the U.S.-China cold war shows that the e-CNY truly has added value to banking customers.\u201D","Donald Day, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based crypto platform VDX, told The Block in an email exchange that, given the PBOC has ambitions for the e-CNY circulation to increase significantly during 2023, \u201Cwholesale settlement channels such as those offered by DBS are likely expected to be an important driver of issuance volume of the e-CNY.\u201D","Day added that integration with a major institution could be positive for wider adoption, but it remains to be seen \u201Cwhether offshore entities will favor e-CNY for widespread settlement.\u201D","BNP Paribas SA has also partnered with Bank of China to <a

to its corporate clients, but the move has been questioned by politicians in the U.S., <a

The French lender received a phone call from a Republican congressional aide asking about its work, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.","\u201CThe problem is that nowadays it is tricky for Western financial institutions to engage in partnerships with Beijing promoting the Chinese yuan at a time when efforts towards de-dollarization are growing in several countries,\u201D Giovannini of ICBC said, adding that Western banks need to navigate a \u201Cvery challenging market environment\u201D where geopolitics prevails on commercial considerations.","Both Alipay and WeChat Pay are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/FP_20200427_china_digital_payments_klein.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ubiquitous mobile payment methods<\/a> in China and, to some extent, have <a href=\"https:\/\/forkast.news\/headlines\/wechat-integrates-digital-yuan-into-payment\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">integrated the e-CNY<\/a> into their payment services.","\u201CWhile the e-CNY app has already seen billions worth of the currency transacted throughout China, the biggest challenge is increasing daily usage as most retail users continue to pay via their bank accounts through WeChat Pay and Alipay, skipping the need to put the e-CNY to use,\u201D said Nick Ruck, chief operating officer of Asia-based ContentFi Labs.","One path to challenging the dominance of these platforms is to expand the ways e-CNY can be used.&nbsp;","The southeastern Chinese city of Shenzhen officially started to test prepaid consumption using the e-CNY in June, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.szlhq.gov.cn\/english\/news\/content\/post_10691053.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">local media reports<\/a>. That came after Shenzhen had over 200 firms in industries including education, training and beauty sign up for its e-CNY prepaid platforms in May, state media <a href=\"https:\/\/global.chinadaily.com.cn\/a\/202205\/07\/WS6275c516a310fd2b29e5b277.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">China Daily reported<\/a>.&nbsp;","Bank of China, one of China's largest state-owned banks, also said this month that it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239063\/bank-of-china-tests-sim-card-nfc-payments-for-digital-yuan\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">testing<\/a> a new offline payment method linked to SIM cards for digital yuan. Over the past year, local governments have also been giving away e-CNY vouchers in pilot regions to boost the use of digital money.","But the currency is still limited, with drawbacks including the lack of deposit insurance and interest, according to Day of VDX.","\u201CThe e-CNY faces significant headwinds from existing large payment channels embedded in other apps, since there are no tangible benefits to users above the payment channels already offered, and therefore no reason to convert RMB to e-CNY for payment or settlement purposes,\u201D Day said.&nbsp;","\u201CThis means that expanding the use cases to scenarios that incentivize users to spend e-CNY, and merchants to accept e-CNY is likely the only way to bootstrap retail users into the e-CNY ecosystem,\u201D he added.","© 2023 The Block.
