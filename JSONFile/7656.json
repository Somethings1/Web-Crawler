Starknet is the latest addition to this lineup.","Developers can create appchains using Starknet Stack, the ecosystem\u2019s native developer tooling. These chains will utilize STARK proofs for enhanced security. Central to this stack is Cairo, a programming language developed by the StarkWare team, which shares similarities with Rust.","In a blog <a href=\"https:\/\/starkware.co\/resource\/the-starknet-stacks-growth-spurt\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">post<\/a>, the team suggested that by leveraging Starknet appchains, developers can benefit from enhanced performance. This claim is bolstered by Starknet\u2019s recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239112\/starknet-quantum-leap-upgrade\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">v0.12.0 upgrade<\/a> on mainnet, which reportedly boosted its network performance.","A notable aspect of appchains is their capacity to support features not yet present on Starknet\u2019s main network. This includes features like custom fee market logic, consensus mechanisms and others. Such flexibility can potentially afford developers the ability to customize their application\u2019s configurations and functionalities, the team added.","\u201CStarknet Appchains are the bespoke environment where applications can tailor an instance of Starknet to achieve better control over the specs, lower cost, greater scale and opt-in privacy,\u201D wrote the team.","The team highlighted that there is an escalating interest in application-specific blockchains tailored to meet customized requirements.\u201CThe need for appchains has been apparent for several years and is now getting renewed attention,\u201D the team noted.","Â© 2023 The Block.
