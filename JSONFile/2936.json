This becomes crucial as Layer 2 technologies often depend on rollups, or groups of transactions executed off-chain and then collectively uploaded to the mainnet as a single entry. For these rollups to be authenticated, it's essential that all participants in the network can reach the base transaction data.","The Arbitrum Foundation also indicated that Celestia's Blobstream will be deployed into Arbitrum-based Layer 2s for via the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235980\/offchain-labs-unveils-tool-to-build-layer-3-orbit-chains-on-arbitrum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Orbit software stac<\/a>k.","\"We are delighted to welcome Celestia to the Arbitrum ecosystem and to make its technology available for Orbit chains,\" said Elias Abi Daoud, community lead at the Arbitrum Foundation. \"Given the permissionless nature of the Orbit tech stack, we are eager to see the expanding range of supported data availability options beyond Ethereum, and we anticipate the growth of a diverse network of developers leveraging this technology.\"","The integration of Celestia also marks the first external contribution to the Arbitrum Orbit protocol layer. Celestia is approaching the launch of its mainnet in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the Celestia Foundation recently announced an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/253024\/celestia-is-airdropping-60-million-tokens-in-bid-to-build-its-network\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">airdrop<\/a> of 60 million of its native token, named Tia, to 7,579 developers and over half a million on-chain addresses on Ethereum rollups, Cosmos Hub and Osmosis.","Â© 2023 The Block.
