Ukraine\u2019s highly publicized crypto donation campaign, meanwhile, has raised at least $212 million.&nbsp;","\"Pro-Russian donations have gradually increased their momentum compared to pro-Ukrainian donations,\" Elliptic said.","Entities involved in crypto payment rails include the U.S.-sanctioned Task Force Rusich group of PMC Wagner mercenaries. Elliptic also found that senior officials of the so-called Donetsk People\u2019s Republic have been rewarding defectors and intelligence about Ukrainian military positions with bitcoin.","The Elliptic researchers found over 80% of funds channeled to sanctioned entities ended up on exchanges, revealing considerable sanction evasion risks from exchanges if proper compliance measures aren't in place.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/237031\/bitcoin-trades-flat-as-investors-eye-the-feds-fresh-restriction-rhetoric\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin<\/a> was found to be the digital asset of choice for most Russian donations, with comparatively little utilization of DeFi protocols and ether.","Â© 2023 The Block.
