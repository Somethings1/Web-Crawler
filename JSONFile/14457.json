The new AVSs introduced include AltLayer, Brevis, Eoracle, Lagrange, WitnessChain, and Xterio. These services represent a broad spectrum of functionalities designed to address various needs within the Ethereum ecosystem.","Some of these AVSs will make Ethereum rollups faster. Here, Lagrange\u2019s state committee will offer light client functionality to facilitate faster and more secure communication between optimistic rollups and other blockchains. Furthermore, AltLayer\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/284946\/altlayer-enables-token-staking-unveils-fast-finality-service-for-rollups\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">MACH platform<\/a> will speed up rollup finality with confirmation speeds of under 10 seconds, EigenLayer noted.","Another critical introduction is Eoracle, the first Ethereum-native oracle network developed on EigenLayer that will allow the integration of real-world data into decentralized applications. Another AVS called Brevis is developing \u201Ccoprocessors\u201D on EigenLayer. Coprocessors focus on providing efficient computational resources, particularly beneficial for operations that require stateless computations.","These services are secured with EigenLayer\u2019s restaking protocol. Restaking allows users to employ their staked ETH \u2014 or a corresponding liquid staking token \u2014 on EigenLayer for restaking purposes. EigenLayer then allocates this ETH to secure third-party applications, termed actively validated services, thereby broadening Ethereum\u2019s security framework.","The introduction of these services follows the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/287435\/eigenlayer-restaking-platform-and-eigenda-data-availability-layer-debut-on-ethereum-mainnet\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mainnet rollout<\/a> of EigenLayer and its data availability layer, EigenDA, earlier this week, followed by EigenLayer operators coming online.","EigenLayer previously stated that it would allow the operator and AVS marketplace to develop and stabilize before introducing in-protocol payments and slashing to the mainnet later this year. The total value locked in EigenLayer currently exceeds <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/restaking\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$15 billion<\/a>.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/decentralized-finance\/restaking\/eigenlayer-daily-total-value-locked\/embed\" title=\"EigenLayer Daily Total Value Locked\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
