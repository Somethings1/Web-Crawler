Form PF is a confidential filing that hedge funds make to the SEC to report their exposure to certain assets. It originated after the 2008 financial crash, which was largely a product of opaque private funds holding junk assets \u2014 most famously, subprime mortgages.","The current <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/files\/formpf.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Form PF<\/a> features no mention of digital assets at all. The two regulators <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162770\/sec-cftc-consider-new-crypto-reporting-rule-for-large-hedge-funds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">agreed to a joint proposal<\/a> to add digital asset reporting early in August. \"The proposal would add a new sub-asset class for digital assets and define the term 'digital asset,'\" the request for comment explains.","The questions that appear in the request for comment are, consequently, pretty foundational: Should reporting entities have to identify the specifics of their holdings by name or by type of digital asset, should there be different standards for fiat-redeemable stablecoins and central bank digital currencies, and should tokens that represent equity be another class.&nbsp;","The comment period ends October 11.&nbsp;","© 2023 The Block.
