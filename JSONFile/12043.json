A problematic protocol change created a sudden rise in ICHI\u2019s price, which was immediately followed by a large crash.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The token price crashed significantly very quickly. Image: CoinGecko.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this piece we explore what went so terribly wrong for the protocol, leading to its eventual collapse, and that this shows just how fragile DeFi protocols can be.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ichi is a DeFi protocol that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.ichi.farm\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">markets itself<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> as \"currency for every community\" and lets third-party projects create stablecoins of their own. These stablecoins are called oneTokens and can be minted using collateral like USDC and wrapped bitcoin.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The protocol\u2019s stablecoins (oneTokens) maintain a peg to the US dollar via incentivized liquidity pools. This is where the protocol rewards users with tokens to help maintain a value around a dollar mark.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ichi operates liquidity pools and lending markets for oneTokens using decentralized exchange Uniswap as the base protocol, as part of its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/angel.ichi.org\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Angel Vault<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> offering. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The protocol also manages a lending market Rari Capital\u2019s Fuse protocol (not to be confused with Fuse Network). This is called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.rari.capital\/fuse\/pool\/136\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">token vault #136.<\/span><\/a>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the #136 token vault, depositors can supply different assets to earn a yield, and borrowers can borrow assets in exchange for a fee. The pools pay rewards in its governance token called ICHI, which like most cryptocurrencies is naturally volatile in price.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rari Capital\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/app.rari.capital\/fuse\/pool\/136\/info\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">#136 Fuse vault<\/a> is where the incident largely took place. The problems started when the Ichi team decided to increase the loan-to-value (LTV) limit for lending assets within the #136 vault to 85%.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The LTV limit or 'collateral factor' determines how much a user can borrow on their collateral from a lending protocol. If a project has a low LTV limit, then it\u2019s much safer because if the value of the collateral drops, the loan is less likely to get liquidated. Having a higher LTV limit means higher risk.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A liquidation is where the lending protocol automatically sells off the collateral to recover the value of the loan. For this vault, liquidations are triggered if the value of the collateral falls by 15% \u2014 and the loan is on the edge of going underwater.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">After the team raised the LTV limit, some users started making significant loans and then using them to borrow ICHI tokens, and repeat the process over.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The excessive borrowing and resulting liquidations is the reason why the token price rallied and then came down sharply. Reports say liquidations cascaded as soon as prices started to correct, starting with one large sale of $10 million in Ichi, according to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/ichifarm\/postmortem-of-pool-136-3cb22102065a\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">post-mortem report <\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">from the Ichi team.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jonathan Wu, who leads growth at Aztec Protocol, said in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonwu_\/status\/1513857064153452545\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Twitter post<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> stating the ICHI-denominated collateral within the #136 Rari Capital token vault sunk in value with the token crash \u2014 causing most of the loans to be liquidated. The continous selling of ICHI tokens led to the drying up of liquidity within the vault, according to Wu.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The problem was anyone could deposit 10,000 ICHI tokens (worth $1 million when the price of the token was $100) and borrow 850,000 in USDC stablecoin, and take another loan. Those that did this were essentially using the protocol to get into a leveraged position.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">But there wasn\u2019t enough liquidity across DEXs to support such a high LTV. When the price of ICHI suddenly moved by 15% from its highs, the protocol liquidated all ICHI lenders and their corresponding collateral was sold on the market.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Jack Longarzo, a developer at Rari Capital, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JackLongarzo\/status\/1513587622282772487\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> the situation was a consequence of \u201Cplenty of red flags\u201D from the team and that a 85% collateral factor was too high for the protocol to function normally.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CA collateral factor of 85% is extremely high. Additionally, the team didn't use supply caps and allowed an infinite amount of ICHI to be used as collateral. This allowed ICHI holders to borrow extensively against uncapped collateral,\u201D Lorzango explained, speaking of the team\u2019s mistake.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The sales created a spiraling effect further pushing down ICHI\u2019s price. The post-mortem report said the recent events were \u201Cnot in line with our core values or the expectations of our community.\u201D The team has even apologized for the incident within its Telegram channels. It has since lowered the LTV limit to 50%.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The protocol raised $3.5 million in February 2022 to build a protocol that aims to remove DeFi's dependence on centralized stablecoin issuers, and create a system using so projects can build their algorithmic stablecoins with various crypto assets as collateral.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked on the Ichi protocol now stands at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/ichi-farm\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">$31 million <\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u2014 a fraction of $130 million in assets deposited in its token pools before the crash.<\/span>","&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
