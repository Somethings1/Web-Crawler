We contain multitudes.&nbsp;<\/em>","If you have the unpleasant experience of getting sued, one of the opening gambits your lawyer might try is to move to dismiss the lawsuit. In federal court this usually arises under Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Not to be a Negative Nate here, but these things are usually not granted because the standard to survive such a motion isn\u2019t hard to satisfy. But sometimes they are and there are sometimes tactical reasons for moving even if you think you\u2019ve got a slim chance.","We\u2019ve written about the Winklevoss v. Shrem lawsuit in the past and if you want to catch up on the merits of that case, you can look at one of prior pieces <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2018\/11\/09\/winklevoss-lawsuit-against-charlie-shrem-peeled-out-in-top-gear-but-now-may-be-stuck-in-neutral\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">here<\/a>. In the latest chapter in this bare knuckled bitcoin litigation, the case survived a motion to dismiss late December. And the court last week issued an opinion explaining why it wouldn\u2019t dismiss the lawsuit. It was maybe worth a try, but a competent lawyer usually doesn\u2019t file a lawsuit that can\u2019t beat a 12(b) motion.","First, the court rejected the argument that there it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because \u201CShrem fails to show to a \u2018legal certainty\u2019 that the total of all four of WCF\u2019s claims cannot exceed $75,000.\u201D The court says that even if WCF only gets $61,000 on the fraud claim\u200A\u2014\u200Athat\u2019s the amount WCF says they gave Shrem to buy bitcoin for it\u200A\u2014\u200Athere are other potential damages claims, including punitive damages claims, the court noted. In short, more than enough allegations to get past $75,000, which is what you need to get Federal Court \u201CDiversity Jurisdiction\u201D in the United States.","Second, as the allegations themselves\u200A\u2014\u200Athis isn\u2019t a hard standard. You have to lay out legal allegations and facts with requisite particularity to survive dismissal. The court doesn\u2019t evaluate the merits of the claims, which are assumed true for purposes of the ruling.","True or not, the Court says that \u201CThe events alleged in WCF\u2019s complaint suffice to give rise to the requisite strong inference that Shrem acted fraudulently. WCF alleges that Shrem intentionally misrepresented his intentions to use WCF\u2019s money to buy WCF Bitcoin and to provide a full accounting of those purchases in order to induce WCF to give him money that he could take for himself, and that he similarly shortchanged at least one other purchaser in order to build a personal Bitcoin fortune.\u201D Again, and this is important\u200A\u2014\u200Athese are unproven allegations\u200A\u2014\u200Athe Court isn\u2019t saying they are true. The Court says that the other allegations also meet pleading standards.","What\u2019s next? Initial disclosures, discovery (written and depositions), and then I imagine we will see summary judgments. A summary judgment motion is where a court decides on the factual merits of a case and whether there is a sufficient dispute for a case to go trial.","I am totally guessing of course but this feels like a case that gets tried if it isn\u2019t settled. It doesn\u2019t seem like a summary judgment decision, at least from the outside. Something like 98 percent of all cases settle. I\u2019m not sure what the incentive is here. WCF doesn\u2019t need the money, has used heavy artillery from the outset (prejudgment attachment, which failed but was an expensive first move) and seems to be sending a message.","The Block<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> is delighted to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
