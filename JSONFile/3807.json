The team pointed out that network decentralization plays a role in determining the classification of a digital token as a security, as highlighted by the SEC's release of the \"Hinman documents\" last June.","Several analysts have decreased their optimism regarding the SEC's potential approval for a spot ether ETF by May. Last week, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, for instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/EricBalchunas\/status\/1773455316081934825\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> his odds for May approval remain pessimistic at 25%, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/271874\/ethereum-etf-approval-may-ether-price-surge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">down<\/a> from 70% in January.","The SEC is currently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/286255\/sec-asks-for-public-comment-for-grayscale-bitwise-and-fidelity-spot-ethereum-etfs?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">soliciting comments<\/a> on a handful of spot ETH ETF applications, including from Fidelity, Grayscale and Bitwise.
