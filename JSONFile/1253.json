This would consequently limit the risk of exposure to any single staking provider,\u201D said a spokesperson from Nexus Mutual.","The Nexus Mutual team noted that it chose <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/139832\/cowswap-unlocks-100-million-airdrop-for-its-early-supporters\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoW Swap<\/a> as its preferred DEX aggregator because of its price-matching capabilities, protection against maximal extractable value (MEV), and its ability to handle substantial volumes without significant slippage.","CoW Swap has previously facilitated transactions for other DAOs, such as Ethereum Name Service's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/209222\/ens-dao-votes-to-sell-16-5-million-of-eth-for-usdc-via-cow-swap\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">swap<\/a> of 10,000 ETH into USDC stablecoin in February.
