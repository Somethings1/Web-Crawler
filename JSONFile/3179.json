Flow also powers the popular NFT basketball platform NBA Top Shot.","According to Rarible co-founder Alexander Salnikov, the marketplace plans to partner with several low-cost and environmentally-friendly blockchains.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CFlow has a fantastic track record of bringing NFTs mainstream by creating native experiences for non-crypto audiences,\u201D Salnikov said in a statement. \u201CAs a blockchain, Flow enables easier access and lowers the entry barrier for consumers and brands via gasless minting, low-cost transactions, and scalability. As we enter the next stage, pursuing to further pioneer the mass adoption of NFTs, we see Flow as a perfect partner for this journey.\u201D<\/span>","According to Salnikov, the Series A funding will be used to make new hires as well as to continue developing the marketplace. More specifically, the Rarible team plans to adopt a layer 2 solution to bring down gas costs, which will make it easier for any digital artist to enter the space and sell their work. The team also plans to make the consumer experience more user-friendly and seamless by allowing users to carry out transactions using a debit or credit card.","Lastly, the team is working on launching a decentralized protocol that will be governed by its own DAO, which it says will \"place decision-making power in the hands of our community.\"","The Rarible marketplace, which launched in 2020, experienced a significant <a href=\"https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/rarible\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">increase<\/a> in trading activity with the NFT boom that took place earlier this year.
