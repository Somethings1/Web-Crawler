The relief to the market comes after a brutal January, which saw coins hit their lowest levels since the middle of last year alongside a rout in global equity markets. Solana \u2014 which hit lows near $86 at the end of January \u2014 was up 17.82% at $107, while Terra \u2014 which hit lows near $43 last month \u2014 was trading up 11% at $52.","Solana and Terra are still down 40% and 43%, respectively, since the start of the year. Bitcoin is down about 18% year-to-date.&nbsp;","Broadly, investors fled risky assets like stocks and cryptos last month as Fed-tied anxieties grasped markets. The US Federal Reserve is set to hike rates and scale back its balance sheet in an attempt to curb inflation \u2014 a move that would remove liquidity that's helped prop up a wide-range of asset prices.","Indeed, the US stock market last month experienced the worst January since the global financial crisis, as noted by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/5cf5199c-5538-40b6-a059-d2c795108919?segmentId=dddf6252-6e37-bb4b-bda7-2193a3453893\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Financial Times<\/a>.&nbsp;","But it looks like Fed fears are subsiding.&nbsp;","In a note to clients on Tuesday, JPMorgan said that it views the market as over-sold.&nbsp;\"The stock market is not only in correction, it is already in bear market territory without a recession in site,\" the bank's analysts wrote.&nbsp;","\"Investor sentiment is already extremely bearish with Put\/Call ratio reaching the highest level since March 2020.\"","As for the Fed specifically, the bank said (emphasis is our own):","\"<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">We disagree with the current fear of a Fed policy mistake or an early end to the current cycle<\/strong> ... The current cycle is taking place in a backdrop of above average nominal GDP and EPS growth, which should allow the equity market to easily outperform cash and fixed-income over the coming years, even if one assumes some gradual de-rating.\"","If the bank is correct and Fed-tied fears soon abate, then that could serve as a tailwind for broader cryptocurrency markets. Although bitcoin has long been touted as a store of value or hedge against stock performance, cryptocurrencies \u2014 for the most part \u2014 have traded in a similar direction to stocks.&nbsp;","JPMorgan's clients are already gearing up to enter the stock market again, with 78% of surveyed clients noting that they are likely to increase their equity exposure over the coming days and weeks.&nbsp;","","","Â© 2023 The Block.
