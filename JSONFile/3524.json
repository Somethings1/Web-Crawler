First, congratulations to this plaintiff for having the frigging moxie to go at it alone and turn out a not terrible lawsuit. &nbsp;It's better than some of I've seen and good for you for not waiting around for someone to take your case on contingency.&nbsp; Second, though, lawyers will tell you that a person who represents themselves has a fool for a lawyer. There are some exceptions here but while there is a lot of smoke in the lawsuit -- and some fairly serious allegations about fraud and underlying criminality -- there are also difficult jurisdictional issues that will need to be resolved and, also, the causes of action are a hot mess.","","","Forget the fact that there is a typo in the caption (it's declaratory, not declatory).&nbsp; There are 8 counts here, including RICO, with underlying securities claims as the predicate wrongs. Let me just say that securities claims are hard enough after the PSLRA without having to monkey around with the elements of a RICO claim. &nbsp;Without a professional (and even with one), this case has some challenges, including biting off more than maybe you want to chew.","Challenges aside, I'm told by an off the record source with knowledge of prior lawsuits involving Hogeg and token sales that several were settled for 7 figures.&nbsp; So pleading problems aside, perhaps that is the angle here. &nbsp;It seems quite likely, regardless, that if not settled immediately, this case will be subject to some immediate motion to dismiss practice (after the Plaintiff effects overseas service of the defendants, which is also a ton of fun and takes some time)."],"hashtag":[]}
