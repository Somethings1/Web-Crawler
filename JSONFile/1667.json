That means BNB Chain users will be able to directly restake ETH for ezETH, Renzo's liquid restaking token, without bridging and get rewards in EigenLayer points and Renzo's ezpoints. Points are similar to normal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/277823\/crypto-projects-115b-points\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">loyalty points<\/a> like airline miles and are designed to encourage engagement without being directly tradable or valuable.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Renzo already also accepts deposits of wBETH (Binance's liquid staking token) for restaking, Kozinski said, adding that the protocol remains focused on building new restaking integrations for BNB Chain users.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Besides wBETH, Renzo also accepts Lido's liquid staking token stETH in addition to native ETH for restaking, Kozinski noted.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Renzo is currently live in a mainnet beta. The general mainnet launch is expected after EigenLayer's Stage 3 launch.
