This point of view appeared to be a common thread between earlier adopters, who bought bitcoin before 2020, and newer buyers, with 63% percent of recent owners and 57% of long-term holders identifying bitcoin as an investment vehicle.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Researchers also found that the greatest increase of bitcoin owners among those surveyed was in the income group of $70,000 CAD (roughly $50,388.00 USD) or more, up from 5% in 2020 to 17% in 2022. In addition there was a 12% increase in ownership among respondents who earned between $30,000 and $69,900 CAD (roughly $21,600 to $50,380 USD), up from 5% in 2020.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In terms of relative awareness, Bitcoin remains a commonly known term, and 90% of respondents said they had heard of the digital currency, matching figures from previous years. However, among those surveyed, 40% of respondents exhibited a low-level understanding of how bitcoin functions, a little over double that of investor blockchain knowledge measured in 2018. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In addition, 66% of respondents who did not own any bitcoin also showed a basic understanding of the blockchain network.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
