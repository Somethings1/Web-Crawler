Bankman-Fried is currently being held in jail in the Bahamas awaiting an extradition hearing, after not receiving bail.","The regulators allege that Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194526\/for-sbf-and-ftx-the-fraud-started-from-day-one-that-and-other-revelations-from-the-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">operated<\/a> a fraud from day one, improperly diverting FTX customer assets to his majority controlled trading firm Alameda Research and hiding that information from FTX equity investors and customers.","In the spring of 2022, following a significant downturn in the crypto markets, Alameda experienced a large number of margin and loan recalls and the trading firm \"greatly increased\" its usage of customer funds to meet its external debt obligations, the CFTC complaint alleges. By mid-2022, Alameda's total fiat liability with FTX was around $8 billion, the complaint said.","Bankman-Fried directed company executives to reallocate funds to a Korean account he referred to as \u201Cour Korean friend\u2019s account\u201D and \u201Cthe weird Korean account.\"","The Korean account belonged to Alameda but was not tagged with an Alameda identifier, which enabled Alameda's negative balance to be hidden on FTX ledgers, the CFTC said. The account was instead described as \"FTX fiat old,\" the complaint said.","The SEC complaint <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194526\/for-sbf-and-ftx-the-fraud-started-from-day-one-that-and-other-revelations-from-the-sec\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> that Alameda's multi-billion dollar liability with the exchange was stored in an internal account in the FTX database as <a href=\"\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"84e2ede5f0c4e2f0fcaae7ebe9\">[email&nbsp;protected]<\/a>.

This was also applicable to the main Alameda account and the Alameda sub accounts, according to the complaint.","Former FTX executive Nishad Singh, who was responsible for overseeing engineering at FTX, annotated code linked to the Korean account, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-12-14\/ftx-executives-used-korea-account-to-mask-giant-alameda-liabilities\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a report<\/a> from Bloomberg, which cited contributions from Singh's Github account.","Bloomberg said Singh didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.","Bankman-Fried <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/194604\/we-came-we-saw-we-researched-bankman-fried-considered-closing-alameda-in-september\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">contemplated closing<\/a> Alameda Research in September citing the fact that Alameda was not making enough money to justify its existence, according to the CFTC charges.","<span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI only started thinking about this today, and so haven\u2019t vetted it&nbsp;<\/span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">much yet,\" wrote Bankman-Fried at the time. \"But: I think it might be time for Alameda Research to shut down.<\/span>&nbsp;<span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Honestly, it was&nbsp;<\/span><span dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">probably time to do that a year ago.\u201D<\/span>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
