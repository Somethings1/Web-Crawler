Failure to register would be punishable by up to five years in prison and a $1 million fine. Any issuer that wants to do business in the U.S., regardless of where the company is based, would need to register.&nbsp;","The new draft bill includes a two-year ban on stablecoins that aren't backed by a hard asset, and it directs the Treasury Department to lead a study on the topic of such \"endogenously backed\" stablecoins. Tokens already in existence before the bill passes into law would be grandfathered in.","Banking regulators and the National Institute of Standards and Technology would have the ability to set standards for interoperability between stablecoins to allow for ease of use, including mandatory technical and legal specifications to allow users to clear and settle across different payment systems without buying native stablecoins for each.&nbsp;","If the bill becomes law, Congress and the president would direct the Federal Reserve to study the effects of a digital dollar issued by the central bank. The Fed has already begun studying whether to issue a digital dollar, but the bill would mandate certain areas of focus, like the potential impacts on monetary policy, financial stability and privacy for individuals.
