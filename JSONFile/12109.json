It also has a \"pilot project for cloud computing.\"","GPU mining represents 16% (or 21.5 megawatts) of the company's total energy capacity. Most of its power is used to mine bitcoin.","Hive said that in the current \"competitive\" landscape, only miners with the lowest cost of power and most efficient GPUs will prevail. With its cost of $0.03 per kilowatt-hour, the company believes it is \"well positioned to navigate the market ahead.\"","However, it seems also to consider the option of using the 14.8 megawatts of power currently allocated to legacy GPU cards to mine Bitcoin, stating that if it did so, it would be able to add 0.4 to 0.44 exahashes per second (EH\/s) to its bitcoin mining hashrate of 2.3 EH\/s.","Bitcoin miner Hut 8, which has been growing its high-performance computing business, said also on Tuesday that it recently installed 180 GPUs, which are currently mining Ethereum and will \"pivot on demand\" to provide artificial intelligence, machine learning or VFX rendering services to customers.","Â© 2023 The Block.
