Hut 8 has implemented firmware to decrease the voltage of the power supply, while it is trying to repair machines and hire more staff.","Hut 8 did not respond to CoinDesk's request for additional details on the Drumheller mine.","The Drumheller site likely accounts for as much as 0.9 exahash\/second (EH\/s) of Hut 8's computing power. Total installed hashrate across its two Alberta sites was at 2.6 EH\/s at the end of April. The Medicine Hat site in the Canadian state \"hit an all-time operational high\" of 1.72 EH\/s in March, the firm previously said.","Hut 8 also had to stop running 8,000 miners at its third site in North Bay, Ontario due to a dispute with its power provider, in mid-November, and move them to Medicine Hat. Hut 8 hasn't found a way to operationalize all of them as of the end of April.","Read more: U.S. Bitcoin Corp.
