The agency head <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/190289\/cftc-chair-defends-bill-that-ftxs-bankman-fried-also-backed\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">previewed a defense of the bill<\/a> earlier this week during a public interview.","<span data-v-628af130=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">''I think it's important that we fill this regulatory gap before more harm is done to retail investors and institutional investors as well,'' Behnam told a Financial Times crypto asset conference.&nbsp;<\/span>","But despite the spotlight, one of the senators writing the legislation acknowledged that the bill would not move until next year, due to the realities of the congressional calendar, complexity of the subject matter, and strong debate around the legislation.","\u201CI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen this year,\u201D said Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., the top Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee and co-author of the bill with Senate Agriculture Chair Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. Boozman told reporters that, \u201Cthis process is long and arduous, which it should be, to get a good product.\u201D","Boozman added that the committee wanted to advance the bill \u201Ca few months ago,\u201D but acknowledged that, \u201Cwe couldn\u2019t get agreement amongst all the stakeholders.\u201D","The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/182827\/defi-advocates-push-back-against-ftx-backed-crypto-bill\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bill divided representatives for digital asset companies and projects<\/a>, with decentralized finance advocates in Washington (and online) fiercely opposed. The division turned toward hostility for Bankman-Fried, who was the loudest industry advocate for the DCCPA. Industry or individual opponents argued the legislation would create regulatory moats for decentralized projects, because it would create a framework for centralized crypto exchanges.","The FTX implosion has outspoken proponents of stronger financial regulations in the Senate criticizing the bill from the opposite direction, and saying that the Senate should hit pause.","Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who sits on the Agriculture Committee told The Block that he believes the legislation should be paused, and that Stabenow knows his view on the matter.","\u201CThis bill leans too much to the industry,\u201D elaborated Brown. \u201CThe industry has betrayed the American public, not to mention, all the ways cryptos are jeopardizing national security with what they\u2019ve done,\u201D Brown continued, citing sanctions evasion. \u201CCongress weighing in is fine, but not with the bill that the industry helped write.\u201D","Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the Senate\u2019s biggest financial regulatory hawk, argued that the CFTC wasn\u2019t the right regulator for an everyday investor product.","\u201CThe CFTC has no experience in investor protection,\u201D said Warren, \u201Cwhich makes them the worst possible candidate for regulating a financial product that has been used to rip off millions of people.\u201D","The Massachusetts Democrat disagreed when asked if Bankman-Fried\u2019s lobbying in favor of the bill colored her perception of it.","\u201CThat\u2019s what the content is, and the content is not the direction we should go.\u201D","Though there\u2019s agreement in both parties in Congress, as well as senior regulators and policymakers in the Biden administration that more laws are needed around digital assets, achieving consensus as to what new rules should look like remains far from happening.","\u201CThat\u2019s part of the reason we haven\u2019t marked up,\u201D Boozman said, referring to when a committee debates amendments and final language in a bill before it. \u201CWe\u2019re working with all the stakeholders,\u201D including the Senate Banking Committee, the Arkansas Republican said.","More urgency \u2014 and attention \u2014 around crypto regulations will also attract more ideas, potentially complicating an already busy picture even further.","Brown demurred when asked if he would author his own bill, though he sent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.banking.senate.gov\/newsroom\/majority\/brown-treasury-crypto-legislation\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a letter<\/a> to the Treasury Department earlier Wednesday saying that he looked forward to working on legislative recommendations made by regulators last month, prior to the FTX collapse. Portions of the report making those regulations flagged concerns over companies with \u201Cintegrated\u201D structures, like FTX\u2019s broad-reaching corporate affiliations \u2014 most of which are now in bankruptcy court.","The Biden administration has had a seat at the table negotiating a stablecoins bill in the House of Representatives, but the bipartisan effort hit an impasse that incoming-House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/176803\/senior-house-republican-biden-administration-holding-up-stablecoin-bill\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">blamed on administration officials<\/a>.","Asked if she was working on her own crypto bill, Warren left the possibility open, though vague.","\u201CWe\u2019re working in the area,\u201D she told reporters.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Kollen Post contributed to this report. <\/em>","Â© 2023 The Block.
