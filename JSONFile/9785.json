Little time remains on the legislative calendar, meaning the bill faces long odds to becoming law during the current Congress, which wraps up in early January. But because the bill has bipartisan backing, including from top Agriculture Committee Republican Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) and Senate Republican Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), Stabenow expressed hope it could get a vote before the full Senate, a significant symbolic step.&nbsp;","Any legislation not passed into law before the end of a Congress\u2014every two years\u2014must be reintroduced in order to continue to receive consideration.&nbsp;","The congressional agriculture committees hold jurisdiction over the CFTC because a majority of commodities are considered agriculture.
