{"summary":"Tokenization of real-world assets has been dismissed by many crypto purists for operating under a centralized framework, but new technological advances have migrated the process from closed, permissioned projects onto public, permissionless blockchain platforms.","webName":"coindesk.com","link":"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/consensus-magazine\/2023\/03\/03\/has-tokenizations-moment-finally-come\/","publishDate":"2023-03-03T19:20:32","id":15299,"type":null,"title":"Has Tokenization\u2019s Moment Finally Come?","category":["Consensus Magazine"],"content":["Mentioning \u201Ctokenization of real-world assets\u201D to some of my longer-serving colleagues at CoinDesk can elicit eye rolls \u2013 they\u2019ve heard it all before.","But at the risk of falling into the \u201Cthis time is different\u201D optimism trap, I would say the current buzz around \u201CRWA\u201D feels more real and impactful than the 2018 chatter about \u201Csecurity tokens\u201D and \u201Ctokenized securities\u201D (which, as Noelle Acheson reminded us recently, are not the same thing.)","The idea that blockchain technology and native tokens can represent off-chain assets \u2013 financial securities such as stocks and bonds, or commercial rights such as trade receivables and fractionalized real estate or art \u2013 has been around for a while. The concept tends to find favor around market crash moments, when a public backlash arises against native crypto tokens like bitcoin and ether \u2013 as happened after the bursting of the initial coin offering bubble in 2018 and, now, in the post-FTX era. At such times, a mindset emerges that it\u2019s more palatable to the mainstream to convert familiar, relatively stable, pre-regulated assets into blockchain-based digital assets than to bet on pure crypto.","You\u2019re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system.

Also, many were dismissive of the underlying models used in early tokenization projects, which were built on permissioned blockchains run by consortia of banks or other companies, a centralized framework that crypto advocates view as adding no more value than the more efficient, less expensive option of a SQL database.","Time will tell whether the latest wave of tokenization \u2013 which has drawn in large Wall Street banks, the Singaporean government and asset managers such as Wisdom Tree and Hamilton Lane \u2013 moves this idea beyond the fringe into the mainstream. But there are reasons to believe it has momentum.","One is that technological advances in cryptography since 2018 have encouraged tokenization projects to migrate from those closed, permissioned projects onto public, permissionless blockchain platforms such as Polygon. And that has, in turn, allowed them to tap into the more rapid pace of innovation happening on those chains, including in areas such as zero-knowledge proofs, which enable a balance between the privacy that investors and issuers demand and the advantages of programmability, instant settlement and data transparency.","Another driver behind this advance lies in economic conditions. Inflation and higher interest rates are forcing entities to seek out new markets and trading efficiencies and to free up dormant capital. The pitch behind tokenization is that it achieves all of that.","One leader in this field is Pennsylvania-based fund manager Hamilton Lane, which recently partnered with security token provider Securitize to tokenize some of it $2.1 billion flagship Equity Opportunities Fund V. By making smaller portions of the fund available, the firm invited individuals who can\u2019t write giant-sized checks into a portfolio of illiquid but high-return private equity assets typically reserved for institutional investors.","Other big fund managers are eyeing different, democratizing opportunities. Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson, a keynote speaker at CoinDesk\u2019s Consensus event in April, talks about tokenization offering the opportunity to customize individual investors\u2019 portfolios around their interests \u2013 including adding exotic new assets such as tokenized royalty streams from their favorite musical artists.","Wisdom Tree, which includes among its offerings exchange-trade products on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, threw its hat in this ring too in December, when it announced nine new, Securities and Exchange Commission-approved blockchain-enabled funds.","The trend is not just seen in consumer-facing deals, either. A clique of big banks, including Citibank, HSBC, BNY Mellon and Wells Fargo, partnered in November with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to tokenize dollars used in wholesale interbank transfers. The intent here is to speed up the clearing and settlement time in the daily netting out of payments across each others\u2019 customer account and to reduce the risk of failed payments.","It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the Fed\u2019s de facto endorsement here is an isolated case among government agencies, one that\u2019s limited to working with a few highly regulated institutions with which it is deeply involved on a daily basis. If anything, governments are the ones that are now swimming against the tide in the tokenization drive.","That, too, is a reaction to the market crash and the FTX debacle. Last month, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) \u2013 a multilateral body charged with coordinating regulation to contain systemic risks in international finance \u2013 warned that when decentralized finance (DeFi) attempts to \u201Creplicate some of the functions of the traditional financial system, [it] inherits and may amplify the vulnerabilities of that system.\u201D The point was read by some to say that tokenization of real-world assets, which would allow those tokens to interface with the hurly-burly DeFi markets of crypto, could introduce the latter\u2019s systemic risks to the entire global economy.","It\u2019s one reason why the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund are all calling for international coordination of the crypto industry.","Read more: Policymakers Need to Focus on Tokenization, Not Just Tokens","It would be a real pity if such a regulatory mission were to kill off tokenization altogether because, if managed properly, putting the world\u2019s stocks, bonds and commercial assets on-chain could well reduce systemic risk, not raise it. A tokenized financial system with traceable, instantly settled transactions would be a more transparent and efficient one, with lower risks of the trade failures that happen when settlement is delayed.","That digital assets are a solution to instability might seem strange to those who wrongfully equate the contagion seen across crypto exchanges and lenders last year as a function of blockchain tech. But the reality is that the fallout from the collapse of FTX, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network et al. stemmed from abuses by centralized entities whose opaque token management practices were possible because they operated off-chain like all other traditional financial institutions. Putting transactions on-chain should, in theory, offset such risks while widening access to investment opportunities.","As former Treasury official John Rizzo argued in a recent opinion piece for CoinDesk, policymakers need to be looking at how tokenization can help foster generational wealth in assets such as real estate by making them available to a wider group. In tokenization, Rizzo wrote, \u201Cpublic officials in Washington [D.C.] have an opportunity to come together and focus on powering a revolution in alternative assets that unlocks the storied American Dream for millions.\u201D","CORRECTION March 6, 00:26 UTC: Corrects to remove reference to an earlier art fund. Hamilton Lane was not the the entity behind that project. Also corrects to remove description of the tokenized assets in the recent Hamilton Lane offering as tradeable.
