It will enable the sequencer to execute many transactions at once,\u201D Eli Ben-Sasson, CEO of developer StarkWare and board member of the Starknet Foundation, said in a statement shared with The Block. \u201CThis will address a bottleneck, and keep transactions flowing faster and more efficiently. It's like a subway station with one entrance point tackling congestion by opening more entrances.\"","Starknet recently added support for EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding as part of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/282236\/ethereum-dencun-upgrade-blobs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade<\/a> last week. Following this, Argent, one of the prominent wallet providers on the network, reported a significant reduction in average fees for a swap on Starknet, dropping to $0.04 compared to over $6.80 shortly before the Dencun upgrade.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/scaling-solutions\/scaling-overview\/daily-ethereum-layer-2-l1-data-fees-in-usd\/embed\" title=\"Daily Ethereum Layer 2 L1 Data Fees (in USD)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Cairo Native integration into the Starknet sequencer is also tentatively scheduled for v0.13.3 in Q3, in collaboration with blockchain research firm Nethermind. Cairo Native allows the sequencer to operate directly on standard hardware architecture, which is expected to accelerate transaction execution, decrease latency, and enhance throughput.","Starknet\u2019s v0.14.0, set for Q4, aims to further reduce fees on Starknet through three primary strategies: introducing volition for hybrid data storage, implementing \u201Capplicative recursion\u201D to consolidate data storage evidence, and exploring data availability compression to minimize Starknet\u2019s data footprint on Ethereum.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
