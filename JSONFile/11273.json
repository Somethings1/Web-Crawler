It was created by the pseudonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto, who created the Bitcoin network. Nakamoto also likely mined a high number of other blocks in the network\u2019s early days but it\u2019s unclear exactly how many.","While theoretically, Nakamoto could still be holding onto their private keys to access these wallets and could move or return the funds, the general consensus is that this would be unlikely to happen. This is because funds from wallets associated with Nakamoto, including funds held in the Genesis block, have not moved since Nakamoto\u2019s disappearance in Dec. 2010.","When Nakamoto disappeared, the Genesis wallet only contained the 50 bitcoin that was mined when it was created. Over time, more funds were sent to the wallet and <a href=\"https:\/\/bitinfocharts.com\/bitcoin\/address\/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">its balance rose<\/a> to 72 bitcoin in late 2023. With the latest transaction, the current balance is now 99.67 bitcoin, worth $4.3 million.","This is a drop in the bucket for Nakamoto though. Estimates are that they control as much as 1.1 million bitcoin, currently worth $47 billion \u2014 on paper, that is.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
