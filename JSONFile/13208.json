It has to happen. It's healthy. It's the right thing to do. And we'd love to be helpful any way we can,\u201D Bankman-Fried said. \u201CI think our industry has not always done a great job at saying that. Sometimes maybe that was the intention, but it's come out more like \u2018fuck you\u2019 and that that wasn't as constructive a way to engage.\u201D","Bankman-Fried spoke about crypto for an hour at the Bipartisan Policy Center on Wednesday morning. The wide-ranging conversation was moderated by center President Jason Grumet.","Earlier this month, the Financial Stability Oversight Council released a report identifying possible risks that crypto firms acting as clearing houses or broker-dealers, like FTX, could pose to the financial system. The report, part of a larger set of documents released by the Biden administration this fall, urged lawmakers to pass new crypto regulations.","\u201CHere\u2019s an area where, frankly, a lot of players in the crypto industry have to grapple with how to handle this right now,\u201D Bankman-Fried said, when asked about the report. He suggested new regulatory guardrails that create more transparency, like exchange listing decisions.","If he had the opportunity to address FSOC, a super committee of financial regulators chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Bankman-Fried said he would advocate for regulation and steer clear of the industry\u2019s combative tendencies.","\u201CLet\u2019s start with the low-hanging fruit,\u201D Bankman-Fried said. \u201CI use stablecoins a lot as an example because I think it\u2019s just the cleanest - it\u2019s just like clearly a good thing which helps reduce risk, to do this without getting in the way of legitimate finance. It\u2019s just good. Let\u2019s do that.\u201D","Bankman-Fried added that there is \u201Cso much potential\u201D to set new standards for digital assets and bolster consumer protections.","The FTX boss has appeared at several financial events in Washington this week, and his company is leading a robust lobbying push in the nation's capital. Bankman-Fried\u2019s comments come as regulators and lawmakers weigh new rules for the crypto industry, particularly after this summer\u2019s market crash. Policy watchers expect a stablecoin bill will emerge from the House Financial Services Committee in the next year.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","© 2023 The Block.
