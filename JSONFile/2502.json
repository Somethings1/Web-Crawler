New Head Chef Jared Grey is trying to make the project profitable again and increase its runway \u2014 which he said has been reduced to just 1.5 years.<\/span>","\"After reviewing expenditures, it\u2019s clear that a significant deficit in the Treasury threatens Sushi\u2019s operational viability, requiring an immediate remedy,\u201D Grey said.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Grey argued that the team needs $5 million in order to sustain operations during the current bear market. He said SushiSwap needs \u201Cimmediate action\u201D to ensure adequate funding.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The idea is to take all of the funds generated by trading fees on the exchange. Those that stake the Sushi's governance token sushi receive a token called xSushi, which gives them a reward fee from all trades on the platform. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, xSushi holders receive 0.05% of each swap, 10% of which is directed to the SushiSwap treasury wallet.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the proposal, Grey recommended that SushiSwap should increase the treasury fee ratio from 10% to 100%, leaving no more token rewards for xSushi holders.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Matthew Lilley, core developer at SushiSwap, agreed with Grey\u2019s proposal that this would be a temporary solution and said the current fee-sharing system will be restored after a year.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe timeline is 12 months, if nothing has changed after 12 months it will default back to the original model.

The proposal has already sparked comments from community members, with some users expressing their anger at what they saw as an unjustifiable move.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CDepriving xSushi holders of the fees they are entitled to is a breach of primary covenant before the community,\u201D one community member <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/forum.sushi.com\/t\/reinstated-increase-kanpai-treasury-allocation-to-100\/11475\/5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">responded<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> to the proposal.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Adam Cochran, partner at Cinneamhain Ventures weighed in on the matter, saying the team should justify its performance metrics before asking for a $5 million runway. He described the latest proposal as akin to a \u201Crug,\u201D a term used to describe a situation when a crypto project takes funds from its users.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe team should probably defend a $5m runway with poor key performance indicators [KPIs] before rugging holders,\u201D Cochran <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adamscochran\/status\/1600026381223890949\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, referring to how the project\u2019s actions may harm the interest of xSushi holders.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That being said, SushiSwap is hoping to turn its fortunes around with a planned proposal called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/178658\/sushiswap-weighs-new-dao-structure-that-uses-non-transferable-shares\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Meiji<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, which sets out to create a new decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that will be funded by protocol fees and governed with non-transferable voting shares.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In addition to this, the DAO has proposed introducing Curve-style Vote Escrow (VE) tokenomics. That system would incentivize token holders to lock their assets for an extended period of time, as they will receive rewards for doing so. The idea is that, with these two components in place, the new DAO can become self-sustaining and benefit from more stable capitalization over the long term.<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
