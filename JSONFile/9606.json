It also houses some of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in the country due to the high capacity of fossil fuel energy.","The instruction was based on the high-level bitcoin trading and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/105814\/china-bitcoin-miners-brace-regulatory-uncertainty\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">mining crackdown comment<\/a> brought up during the China State Council meeting last month, the notice said.","The notice cited the \"<a href=\"http:\/\/lawinfochina.com\/display.aspx?id=23537&amp;lib=law#:~:text=Measures%20for%20the%20Energy%20Conservation%20Examination%20of%20Fixed%2DAsset%20Investment%20Projects\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Measures for the Energy Conservation Examination of Fixed-Asset Investment Projects<\/a>\" passed by China's National Reform and Development Commission as the relevant ordinance for government officials to carry out the order.","Though it is hard to pinpoint how much energy capacity exactly is powering up bitcoin mining operations in the Changji Prefecture, the Zhundong development park is known for being a major bitcoin mining hub in Xinjiang with predominantly fossil fuel energy.","Xinjiang's measures on Wednesday may impose a more serious impact on bitcoin's hash rate than the ones issued by its counterpart in Inner Mongolia.","Although both provinces are mostly dependent on fossil fuel energy, bitcoin mining operations in Xinjiang have always outrun those in Inner Mongolia by scale. Further, bitcoin miners in Inner Mongolia have already been moving out of the region since early March.","Bitcoin's total seven-day average computing power has seen a slight growth to 150 exahashes per second (EH\/s) since the last mining difficulty adjustment that happened on May 29.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/on-chain-metrics\/bitcoin\/bitcoins-hash-rate-daily\/embed\" title=\"Bitcoin's Hash Rate (7DMA)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","China's State Council, the central government cabinet, made a comment about cracking down on bitcoin trading and mining in a meeting last month.","The concern was due to a conclusion that bitcoin mining's growth in China was behind the rising demand for coal in certain parts of China, according to a Bloomberg report. The government in Inner Mongolia reacted almost immediately with plans to enforce eight measures to drive out bitcoin mining operations in the area.&nbsp;","Meanwhile, the government in Sichuan, another major bitcoin mining hub known for its cheap hydro-electricity, hosted a meeting last week to gauge how shutting down bitcoin miners would affect the local hydropower economy. No immediate plan was announced during the meeting.","The looming bitcoin mining crackdown in China has so far created <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/107104\/china-bitcoin-miners-state-council-crackdown\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">as much a challenge as an opportunity<\/a> for overseas bitcoin mining farms as Chinese investors have been turning to back-up plans.","Â© 2023 The Block.
