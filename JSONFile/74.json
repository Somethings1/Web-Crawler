Its stance has been that it operates a front-end website that provides access to the Uniswap protocol, code running on Ethereum that it does not directly operate. However, this always created the risk that it would be a prime target for any regulatory agency that wanted to crack down on the decentralized finance industry.","While the SEC has had some cases involving decentralized organizations, this is the first time it has gone after a major protocol.","\u201CThe war on DeFi has begun, we must bring privacy onchain and continue to build censorship resistant systems,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ayyyeandy\/status\/1778130689679908876\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">posted<\/a> The Rollup co-founder, who goes by Andy on X.","Many in the crypto industry expressed support for Uniswap and its founder, Hayden Adams.
