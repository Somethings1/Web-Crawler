Distributed Finance, which was founded by Ross Murray-Jones and Agash Navaranjan, also owns Zest, a builder of investments DAOs on Algorand.&nbsp;","Rand declined to disclose terms of the NFT Explorer acquisition, while noting that the amount paid was less than last year's deal. It added that the company is closing a top-up to its seed round to finance the takeover.&nbsp;","\"There has always been a special, symbiotic relationship between NFTx and Rand, as they share a third of each other's traffic,\" <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Murray-Jones, Rand Gallery's CEO, said in emailed comments. This \"<\/span>will meaningfully strengthen under one umbrella, for example buying\/selling on NFTx and adding rarity alongside other data analytics to Rand. Both platforms will evolve into an NFT experience unrivalled by other chains and thus play a preeminent role in the growth of Algorand.\"","Investors in Distributed Finance include Borderless Capital, the Algorand Foundation, Eterna Capital, Big Brain Holdings and Fun Fair Ventures.","Â© 2023 The Block.
