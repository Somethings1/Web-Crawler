But the company still does not trust the Bahamian government and lawyers appointed to liquidate FTX Digital Markets \u2014 the portion of Bankman-Fried\u2019s large corporate web that is in a separate bankruptcy process in the Bahamas \u2014 with continuous access to computer systems.","Bromley said the company could allow \u201Cstatic\u201D access to computer systems for their counterparts but continue to oppose continuous access due to suspicions around the relationship between Bankman-Fried and the Bahamian government. The country's securities regulator pulled assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars out of the company after obtaining a court order from the Supreme Court of the Bahamas to do so.&nbsp;","\u201CWe think that makes the issue simpler and cleaner,\u201D said Bromley.","But a representative for the liquidators, Jason Zakia of the law firm White and Case, disputed that contention.","\u201CThey need access to their debtors\u2019 books and records in order to do their job as court-appointed fiduciaries,\u201D he told presiding Judge John Dorsey. \u201CThis is really interfering with the ability of the liquidators to do their job.\u201D","A hearing, with witnesses expected, is scheduled for Jan. 6 if the two sides cannot agree on a resolution before then.","On Monday, Bromley and lawyers for the company submitted emails from the week of FTX\u2019s collapse between Bankman-Fried and Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder showing Bankman-Fried offering to give preferential treatment to Bahamas customers by fully refunding account holders from the island nation. The Bahamas Securities Commission, other FTX executives, and Bankman-Fried\u2019s father were included in the email thread. Hours later, the company claimed on Twitter that the government and regulators had told it to facilitate withdrawals for local customers.","The Bahamas Securities Commission disputed this in a court filing on Wednesday that included correspondence by the regulator on the same day alerting Bahamian police to the transfer of funds from FTX to Alameda Research after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/195210\/bankman-fried-lieutenant-alerted-regulators-to-misuse-of-customer-funds\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">a call<\/a> between the regulator and FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Disclaimer:<\/strong> Beginning in 2021, Michael McCaffrey, the former CEO and majority owner of The Block, took a series of loans from founder and former FTX and Alameda CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.
