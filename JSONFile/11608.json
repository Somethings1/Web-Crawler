Pools have become trusted third parties whose permission we have required for activating soft forks and deciding what gets into the blockchain in addition to taking custody of all newly generated coins,\" OCEAN's Global Head of Sales, pseudonymous Bitcoin Mechanic, said. \"By offering transparency and a mechanism for miners to be paid directly by Bitcoin itself, we make the network radically more robust.\"","Mummolin was co-founded by long-time Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr. The Wyoming-based company is the successor to the Eligius Bitcoin mining pool Dashjr founded \u2014 a popular zero-fee mining pool that operated from 2010-2017.","\"The role of mining pools must change for Bitcoin to exist as a truly decentralized currency,\" Dashjr said in the statement. \"OCEAN is a new type of pool that enables miners to be truly miners again. We are launching as the most transparent pool and also the only non-custodial pool where miners are the recipients of new block rewards directly from Bitcoin.\"","\"OCEAN is solving a problem for Bitcoiners that I think all of us feel \u2014 further centralization of mining pools that could plague Bitcoin, and how that risks a bunch of Bitcoin attributes that we hold dear,\u201D Dorsey added.","\"When I see a project that is good for Bitcoin broadly, and that's also good for me and my companies personally, it becomes a simple decision for me and I'm happy to be a part of it,\" Dorsey said.","Barefoot Mining, OCEAN's first customer, said the new pool would bring some badly needed diversity to Bitcoin mining. \"In my opinion, this is the most significant new company announcement in the Bitcoin world over the past few years,\u201D Barefoot Mining CEO Bob Burnett said. \u201CThe new pool will bring new features and some badly needed diversity to the mining world.\"","Two centralized Bitcoin mining pools, AntPool and Foundry USA, currently dominate hashrate distribution, with an estimated combined market share of over 55% of the total Bitcoin hashrate, according to Blockchain.com.","However, it is important to note that these pools are made up of numerous geographically dispersed Bitcoin miners with the flexibility to redirect their mining power to different pools at any time.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bitcoin mining hashrate distribution.
