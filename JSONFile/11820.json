It is pessimistic but without any conviction,\" they added. \"Open interest remains stable,\" and there are no significant flows into bitcoin futures ETFs. The options market's skew, which gauges traders' bullish or bearish inclinations, is notably volatile.","September and October favor a more substantial exposure to ether, with the second-largest cryptocurrency carrying stronger ETF momentum in the short term, K33 Research wrote.","Futures-based ether ETFs could get a final verdict in mid-October, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/246130\/crypto-prices-rally-back-as-sec-said-to-be-ready-to-greenlight-ether-futures-etfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">SEC said to be ready to greenlight the proposals<\/a>.
