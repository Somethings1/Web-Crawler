However, if the NFTs are transferred on and off the Kraken platform then they will incur those fees.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">A screenshot of Kraken's NFT marketplace.<\/span>","Royalties will remain a mandatory component within the marketplace. Royalties are fees that go back to the creator of collection on every sale of their NFT. NFT creators can secure a regular income via royalties, which are a key reason why many creators have flocked to NFTs. However, they are also seen as a source of friction for NFT traders.","\"A portion of the value sold on our marketplace goes back to the original content creator,\" a Kraken spokesperson said. \"This ensures creators are always properly compensated for their time and efforts.\"","Royalties have become a controversial topic in the crypto industry as a number of leading exchanges such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/180427\/looksrare-becomes-latest-nft-marketplace-to-nix-royalties-exclusive\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">LooksRare<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/177414\/solana-nft-platform-magic-eden-opts-for-optional-royalty-payments\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Magic Eden<\/a> have pivoted away from mandating a royalty-fee on NFT trades.","Other features on Kraken's marketplace include being able to list or offer NFTs in eight fiat currencies as well as over 200 cryptocurrencies on the platform and the ability to view and purchase NFTs listed on other marketplaces under the protection of Kraken\u2019s security framework.","Kraken's NFT marketplace follows in the footsteps of rival exchanges that have also started marketplaces such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/145085\/coinbases-nft-marketplace-beta-is-now-open-to-everyone\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Coinbase<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/107087\/crypto-exchange-ftx-nft-marketplace\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">FTX<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/109312\/binance-nft-marketplace-warhol-dali\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance<\/a>.
