Trading of the majority of Solana-based NFT collections \u2014 such as Solana Monkey Business, Degenerate Ape Academy and Aurory \u2014 has taken place elsewhere, typically on emerging marketplaces like Solanart and Digital Eyes. But with no one established marketplace, FTX.US is now throwing its hat in the ring.","\u201CWith the launch of this platform, we hope to provide both US and global users with a regulated marketplace that is intuitive and responsive to their needs,\u201D said FTX.US president Brett Harrison in a statement.","FTX.US\u2019s expansion will begin with 75 NFT projects, according to Harrison. It intends to add support for all NFTs that are based on Solana\u2019s Metaplex standard, but it does have a few exceptions. Unlike current marketplaces that have few restrictions, FTX.US is not listing projects that regulators might consider securities offerings \u2014 such as projects that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/120016\/why-ftxs-upcoming-marketplace-is-avoiding-nfts-that-offer-royalties\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">offer royalties<\/a>.","To help protect customers from buying fake NFTs, FTX.US will work with NFT creators to ensure that it verifies the authenticity of the NFTs available for sale.","FTX.US\u2019s marketplace will let customers buy and sell NFTs at fixed prices and will also have an auction system \u2014 similar to how OpenSea operates. Customers can fund their accounts for buying NFTs with bank transfers, credit card payments or crypto transactions. NFTs can be purchased in US dollars, solana (SOL) or ether (ETH).","The new marketplace will also let customers withdraw NFTs from the platform to external wallets. Currently, it\u2019s limited to Solana-based NFTs (the FTX brand is closely linked with the Solana ecosystem) but it intends to add support for Ethereum-based NFTs. Harrison said this feature will be \u201Ccoming soon.\u201D","Disclaimer: The former CEO and majority shareholder of The Block has disclosed a series of loans from former FTX and Alameda founder Sam Bankman-Fried.","Â© 2023 The Block.
