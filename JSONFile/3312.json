There could be more exploits due to the bug, said Igamberdiev.","The attackers have sold at least $5 million worth of COVER tokens at the time of writing. It remains to be seen whether they are able to liquidate more. In other words, whether they are able to convert COVER tokens into, say, bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH).","The price of the COVER token has fallen sharply since the attacks and is currently trading down by about 67% at around $227, according to CoinGecko.","In light of the attack, crypto exchange <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/support\/announcement\/aec178a59f824162ab77a17a5d0838a5\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Binance has suspended COVER deposits<\/a>, as well as trading for all COVER trading pairs.
