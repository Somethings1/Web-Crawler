It looks like the launch of [the] new chain is decided even before voting is finished.\u201D","TerraUSD, a stablecoin native to the Terra blockchain, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/146444\/terra-luna-and-ust-how-we-got-here\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lost its peg<\/a> to the US dollar last week, destroying more than $40 billion of value in a few days. To revive the network, Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon is seeking approval from validators to fork Terra and reallocate its tokens, with many subject to vesting periods.","While a majority of validators \u2014 who stake tokens and processes transactions on the network \u2014&nbsp;have so far <a href=\"https:\/\/station.terra.money\/proposal\/1623\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">voted in favor<\/a> of the plan, many in the wider Terra community have expressed concerns. Boyko-Romanovsky went as far as to say that the way the vote has been managed goes against the decentralized philosophy of crypto.","Allnodes is one of five validators voting against the plan and represents 1.49% of the Terra network's staked Luna, the token used to vote. Currently 19.7% of votes are vetoing the plan. If this climbs to more than 33.4% when the poll ends in six days, the vote won't pass.","Ahead of the main vote, there was a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/147289\/terra-community-seems-dead-set-against-do-kwons-fork-proposal\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">preliminary poll<\/a> on the Terra governance forum. Nearly 7,000 people voted, with 91% against the idea of a fork.&nbsp;","Boyko-Romanovsky said he didn\u2019t like what happened regarding the preliminary poll. \u201C90% of [the] active community is against [a] fork and still the founder pushes his own narrative without listening to his community,\u201D he said.","He added that the proposed solution was not the best option and that more time should be given to discussions about the path forward. He said that since Terraform Labs may have access to significant voting power, Allnodes decided to stand on the community\u2019s side and vote to veto the proposal.","Â© 2023 The Block.
