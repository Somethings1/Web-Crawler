The purchases were made secretly in order to avoid an open auction.","The firms, which were not named, conspired with Shchigol and Zhor, and the government agency ended up paying 285 million hryvnias ($7.8 million). The purchased goods and services were actually bought from another provider abroad and cost only 223 million hryvnias ($6.1 million). Shchigol and Zhor pocketed the difference, NABU said.","Zhor was arrested on Wednesday, Ukrainian news agency RBC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbc.ua\/ukr\/news\/sud-areshtuvav-kriptovalyutu-ku-znayshli-1701361908.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">reported<\/a>.&nbsp;","Ukrainian public officials have been known for their use for crypto.
