However, if the wallet was compromised, it could also have been signed by an attacker. This means AntPool would need another method to verify the victim\u2019s identity, Mononaut added. It is unclear whether AntPool intends to do this.","According to Mononaut, the likely cause of a hack was the use of a low-entropy wallet, possibly a brainwallet, meaning it was created with insufficient randomness, making it vulnerable to attacks. The transaction was quickly fee-bumped using replace-by-fee (RBF) \u2014 a Bitcoin protocol feature that allows a sender to increase the transaction fee on an unconfirmed transaction, enabling quicker network processing. If it was indeed a low-entropy wallet, multiple attackers could have been competing to steal the funds, Mononaut suggested. This would explain the high fee, with scripts configured to spend a significant portion of the transaction to hinder competitors.","AntPool did not immediately return a request for comment from The Block.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
