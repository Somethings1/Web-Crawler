Then its fee will be 0.24%, the lowest of the lot.","Coming in a close second is Ark\/21Shares, which has offered zero fees for the first six months or until the fund has $1 billion in assets. Once that's over, its fee will be 0.25%, right behind Bitwise. This is substantially lower than its originally suggested fee of 0.8%.","Coming in third is BlackRock, offering fees as low as 0.2% for the first 12 months or until the fund hits $5 billion in assets.

Historically this hasn\u2019t moved needle much (one ETF back in day actually paid you to invest in it until it reached certain aum mark but no one cared). Advisors focused on regular fee since [they're] long term investors.

Grayscale, which is trying to convert its flaship bitcoin trust to an ETF has lowered its fees from 2% to 1.5%. Some issuers haven't yet filed amended S-1 forms, so there might be some changes to come.","As Bloomberg reporter Katie Greifeld <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kgreifeld\/status\/1744325419875049528\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted on X<\/a> \u2014 with particular reference to Ark\/21Shares offering zero fees for a limited time \u2014 \"<span class=\"css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">these are very, very low numbers<\/span>.\" She compared this to SPDR Gold Shares, the largest physically backed commodity ETF, which charges 0.4%.","With these low fees, potential spot bitcoin ETF issuers are clearly competing through their respective fee structures to try to pick up market share in the first few months of a potential launch. This is likely based on the idea that whoever picks up momentum first might carry it through \u2014 as well as the notion that there is a massive potential market for such products.","For instance, VanEck <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vaneck.com\/us\/en\/blogs\/digital-assets\/matthew-sigel-vanecks-15-crypto-predictions-for-2024\/#us-recession-arrival-and-debut-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">estimates<\/a> spot bitcoin ETFs will see $1 billion inflows in the first few days and $2.4 billion within a quarter.
