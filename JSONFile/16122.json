And that\u2019s largely just the U.S. But Binance is the most interesting, not only for what happened (the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued it), but also for what didn\u2019t (the Department of Justice hasn\u2019t filed anything). Plus, the CFTC\u2019s Tech Advisory Committee met last Wednesday.","You\u2019re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.","The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance, the exchange\u2019s founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and a couple other entities on Monday on charges of failing to register as a \u201Cfutures commission merchant\u201D while offering unregistered crypto derivatives options to U.S. customers.","The allegations are pretty striking, with details suggesting the company went out of its way to try to bypass U.S. regulations. CFTC Chief Counsel Gretchen Lowe described Binance\u2019s actions as \u201Cwillful evasion of U.S. law.\u201D These are allegations that have yet to be proven in a court of law. In a statement Monday night, Zhao said the allegations are \u201Can incomplete recitation of facts.\u201D","The question remains: Is this actually a big deal for Binance? I\u2019m going to speculate wildly, so consider this fair warning.","I think the answer is yes. Not for the CFTC charges themselves \u2013 the CFTC can impose monetary fines and bar Zhao from being an officer at a futures commission merchant in future but that assumes Zhao has any interest in being an officer to begin with.","The allegations in the CFTC\u2019s complaint have strong implications for criminal and sanctions-related issues.","Some of the claims in the lawsuit, such as allegations that the exchange was aware that people from sanctioned entities such as Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, were trading on the platform but didn\u2019t see it as a big deal, would probably trigger both Department of Justice and the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control laws.","\u201C[Binance\u2019s former Chief Compliance Officer Samuel] Lim explained to a colleague that terrorists usually send \u2018small sums\u2019 as \u2018large sums constitute money laundering,\u201D the filing said. \u201CLim\u2019s colleague replied: \u2018can barely buy an AK47 with 600 bucks.\u2019 And with regard to certain Binance customers, including customers from Russia, Lim acknowledged in a February 2020 chat: \u2018Like come on. They are here for crime.\u2019 Binance\u2019s [money laundering reporting officer] agreed that \u2018we see the bad, but we close 2 eyes.\u2019\u201D","The CFTC complaint emphasized that Binance uses U.S. services to operate, pointing to Google Suite, Webex, WeWork and Amazon Web Services as examples.","\u201CAmong the services Binance purchases from Amazon Web Services that are provided to Binance in the United States is \u2018AWS CloudFront,\u2019 which according to Amazon Web Services is a \u2018Global content delivery network,\u2019\u201D the filing said.","We\u2019ve known for a while now that Binance used AWS servers in Japan after an outage affected the exchange a few years ago.","The final piece of this puzzle: We can look at how the Department of Justice has gone after companies and websites accused of distributing ransomware or offering \u201Ccyberattack-for-hire services\u201D or even whatever the heck this was.","In those instances, the U.S. government was able to seize the domains and put up a large banner announcing that. The services themselves were inaccessible to their users.","All this is to say that if the U.S. really thought Binance was a criminal enterprise, it already has the tools it needs to shut down the exchange.","Now to be clear, I\u2019m told there's nothing imminent coming from the Justice Department or Office of Foreign Asset Controls about Binance. But as we\u2019ve seen with Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, sometimes the DOJ will have a sealed indictment that it won\u2019t publish until the subject is arrested, and so we may now just be in a holding pattern.","Last week, the CFTC\u2019s Technology Advisory Committee met for the first time under Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero, Chairwoman Carole House and Vice Chairman Ari Redbord.","\u201CWe look forward to taking a deep dive on the rapidly growing decentralized-finance (DeFi) ecosystem,\u201D Goldsmith Romero said during her opening remarks. \u201CAs regulators and Congress make policy decisions related to DeFi, it is important to have a common foundation and understanding how DeFi works and how decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or other DeFi protocols [work].\u201D","This foundation could be as basic as understanding what the indicators of decentralization are, she added, touching on other issues like the role of artificial intelligence in financial markets, digital identity and possible illicit activities in the digital sector.","The meeting was divided into presentations by various members interspersed by free-flowing discussions about issues surrounding regulatory questions in crypto (and other technology topics like artificial intelligence).","Different perspectives were all given equal weight by the different members of the committee, Goldsmith Romero told CoinDesk after the meeting ended, pointing to one participant who asked questions about the value crypto products brought the financial sector in a room full of crypto executives and researchers.","\u201CPeople were very willing to contribute,\u201D she said.","House said much of the discussion circled around the concept of accountability, which is at the heart of many of the topics discussed, whether that is privacy or decentralized finance or other issues.","\u201CThere has to be accountability, both for the regulated activity \u2026 but also for the non-financial activity that occurs,\u201D she said.","Goldsmith Romero expressed a similar view during her opening remarks, saying there is discussion about where accountability rests within a DeFi project, whether it\u2019s the code underpinning a smart contract, the organization responsible for bringing the code into the world, an evolving governance structure or something in between.","The forum saw a nuanced discussion about how different parties could achieve confidence in the technology around digital assets and other issues while still ensuring compliance with the law, Goldsmith Romero said after the meeting ended. \u201CI\u2019m glad to have that in this forum.\u201D","There was much ado made the other week about New York Community Bancorp\u2019s (NYCB) Flagstar Bank acquiring Signature Bank\u2019s non-crypto deposits last Monday, leaving about $4 billion worth of deposits in the lurch. Coming on the heels of a Reuters report that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) would force any potential buyer of Signature to give up the crypto business (a report the FDIC denied), there was a growing wave of opinion that this was further evidence that bank regulators were trying to actively boot crypto off the banking system. As always, though, it\u2019s possible things are a bit less conspiratorial than the public narrative seems.","Joshua Ashley Klayman, head of blockchain and digital assets at law firm Linklaters, pointed to 2021 guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), one of the federal bank regulators, that told banks that they need permission before they can get into crypto-related activities. The regulator has already barred one new conditional bank from engaging with crypto when it approved SoFi in 2022, she said.","\u201CIt shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that, as any bidding bank presumably would need OCC approval, that, if they didn\u2019t already have OCC approval to engage in digital asset activities, they weren\u2019t reasonably going to be able to obtain it over a weekend, even if they wanted to start doing crypto,\u201D Klayman said.","The OCC indeed published a notice signing off on the Flagstar acquisition.","Klayman noted that \u201Cwe don\u2019t know if Flagstar even wanted to have a crypto business, or if it even had the capability to support one. But it almost certainly didn\u2019t have the time to obtain regulatory approval to start one by Monday.\u201D","Only 136 FDIC-insured banks in the U.S. even offer any kind of crypto activities or plan to, according to an FDIC Inspector General report from February. That\u2019s out of 4,706 total FDIC-insured banks (as of the end of 2022).","The FDIC is now giving the remaining Signature Bridge Bank depositors until April 5 to withdraw their funds, or the regulator will send a check to the listed address. It\u2019s also still trying to sell the Signet platform, a payments platform that was popular with Signature\u2019s crypto customers.","This past weekend, the FDIC said that First Citizens Bank will acquire the deposits from Silicon Valley Bank. One detail that struck me: When the FDIC announced Flagstar\u2019s takeover of Signature deposits, it explicitly said that Signature Bridge Bank depositors \u201Cother than cash depositors related to the digital-asset banking businesses, will automatically become depositors of\u201D Flagstar.","No such language existed in the announcement of First Citizens\u2019 takeover of SVB deposits. I reached out to the FDIC and First Citizens to confirm just what this meant. The FDIC referred me to First Citizens, which hasn\u2019t responded.","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","If you\u2019ve got thoughts or questions on what I should discuss next week or any other feedback you\u2019d like to share, feel free to email me at nik@coindesk.com or find me on Twitter @nikhileshde.","You can also join the group conversation on Telegram.","See ya\u2019ll next week!","Edited by Henry Bond."],"entity":[{"type":"CFTC\u2019s Technology Advisory Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Goldsmith Romero","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$4 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Signet","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"State of Crypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zhao","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"February 2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Sam Bankman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Chairwoman Carole House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Henry Bond","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Signature Bridge Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Google Suite","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Justice Department or Office of Foreign Asset Controls","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Linklaters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"2022","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Thursday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Gretchen Lowe","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Amazon Web Services","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Terraform Labs","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Samuel] Lim","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"night","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Hamas","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"FTX","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"House","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Christy Goldsmith Romero","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"First Citizens Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Reuters","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"SVB","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Tech Advisory Committee","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Silicon Valley Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Signature Bridge Bank depositors","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Webex","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"OCC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"weekend","content":"DATE"},{"type":"WeWork","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"New York Community Bancorp","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"last Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Tuesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AWS","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"United States","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"First Citizens","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Department of Justice","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Klayman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Justin Sun","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Joshua Ashley Klayman","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Congress","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Japan","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"FDIC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Commodity Futures Trading Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Custodia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Ari Redbord","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"last week","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Flagstar","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Binance","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Flagstar Bank acquiring Signature Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Newsletters","State of Crypto","Binance","CFTC","FDIC","Signature Bank","Silicon Valley Bank","OCC"],"authors":["Nikhilesh De"]}
