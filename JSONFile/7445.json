The idea is to provide clients a separate but interoperable model for execution and settlement.","Simon Forster, co-head of digital assets at TP ICAP, said the current crypto market infrastructure prevents many institutional clients from trading because most execution venues require pre-funding and also act as custodians.","\"This poses challenges from a conflict of interest perspective and results in fragmented liquidity,\" said Forster. \"Our partnership, and resultant new platform, is a natural evolution in market structure that will make digital assets, such as Bitcoin, more accessible for the wholesale market.\"","The platform is subject to registration with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority and is expected to launch by the end of this year. It will allow institutional clients to spot trade in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/prices\/btc-price\/embed\" title=\"BTC Price\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","TP ICAP is the latest traditional financial services firm to enter the crypto spot trading market.
