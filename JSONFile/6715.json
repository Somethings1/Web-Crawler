On ETC block rewards fell from a 24 hour average of around 58 cents to just over 1 cent, while rewards for blocks on RVN fell from a 24 hour average of $1.77 to just over 4 cents in more recent hours according to <a href=\"https:\/\/minerstat.com\/coin\/ETC\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Minerstat<\/a> data.","\u201CEven running new generation hardware at sub 3 cent power is not profitable on ETC now,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ethan_vera\/status\/1570405590450552832\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">tweeted<\/a> Ethan Vera, COO of Luxor, which runs an Ethereum mining pool.","Without a profitable network to mine, as many as 20% to 30% of miners have simply shut down operations according to Vera.","Vera had previously <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/168380\/whats-left-for-ethereum-gpu-miners-after-the-merge\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">estimated<\/a> that only miners contributing around 100 terahash per second to the Ethereum network would find a home on other blockchains, citing a need for state-of-the-art hardware and low electricity prices to remain competitive.","Now, it would appear that even the latest hardware rigs and cut-rate energy costs may not be enough to turn a profit on networks like ETC, where as much as a 280% <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/170293\/ethereum-classics-hash-rate-soars-280-in-a-single-day\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">rise<\/a> in hash rates occurred over the last 24 hours.","Â© 2023 The Block.
