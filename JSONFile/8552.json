Polyhedra Network's collaboration with EigenLayer and the integration of Renzo\u2019s Liquid Restaking Token ezETH, further enhance the capabilities and security of the zkBridge ecosystem. Powered by EigenLayer\u2019s dual staking, the integration of zkBridge and Renzo will secure the trust-minimized interoperability for Bitcoin with 1.8 Billion crypto-economic security, including both Renzo\u2019s liquid restaking token (LRT), and ZK token (Polyhedra Network\u2019s native token) staking.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, lacks native smart contract functionality, Polyhedra Network's zkBridge and its collaboration with EigenLayer and Renzo offer solutions to integrate Bitcoin into cross-chain ecosystems to enable other blockchains to securely write data to Bitcoin. We use EigenLayer\u2019s dual-staking mechanism to equip the economic security to our Bitcoin AVS (i.e., Actively Validated Services), generating yields for both ZK token stakers and Renzo\u2019s LRT, and contributing to the security of the bridge.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In our design for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/polyhedra.medium.com\/empowering-bitcoin-zkbridge-with-eigenlayer-restaking-and-dual-staking-f0e269b113a0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the Bitcoin dual-staking AVS<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, validators are dual-stakers with both ZK token and Renzo\u2019s ezETH to write data on the Bitcoin network. These validators use a consensus protocol to agree on the message they are going to send. Notably, our protocol\u2019s security doesn\u2019t solely rely on the accuracy of the consensus protocol. In cases where the consensus protocol is compromised, users can initiate a zkBridge request to transfer the malicious message from Bitcoin to Ethereum. A slashing contract on Ethereum then assesses the message\u2019s validity and, if necessary, slashes the stakes of the committee members, with a portion of these stakes compensating the user.<\/span>","","","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The integration of Bitcoin into the zkBridge ecosystem not only expands the opportunities for Bitcoin holders but also enhances the overall liquidity and stability of the cross-chain ecosystem. With the ability to seamlessly bridge Bitcoin across various Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, Polyhedra Network's zkBridge, in collaboration with EigenLayer and Renzo, unlocks new possibilities for decentralized finance and cross-chain interoperability, making Bitcoin an integral part of the future of blockchain technology.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The slashing and reward mechanism in our Bitcoin AVS plays a crucial role in maintaining integrity and trust. When a validator is found to be acting maliciously, the slashing protocol is triggered. Here\u2019s how it works:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Layer 2 networks offer high transaction throughput but pose challenges to cross-chain interoperability. To achieve fast finality for Layer-2 networks, especially for optimistic rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and opBNB, while maintaining strong security assumptions, zkBridge introduces a fast bridging solution leveraging an \"auxiliary validation network.\" This network forms an external group that attests to the state of the Layer 2 network, achieving security levels comparable to the network's native fraud proof challenges. By simulating the blockchain execution through the auxiliary validation network, strong security is achieved rapidly, significantly reducing the finality time.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">zkBridge is deployed with a fast finality mechanism and decentralized auxiliary validation network for various Layer 2 networks. The integration involves two components:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To reduce proof verification costs, batch proofs for multiple batches in the Layer 2 network are supported, saving gas costs on the receiver chain for zkBridge proof verification.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Polyhedra Network collaborates with EigenLayer to introduce dual staking across various blockchains, leveraging cross-chain bridges. This approach utilizes ZK token, Polyhedra Network\u2019s native token from different networks for dual staking, allowing ZK token holders to generate profits and benefit the entire ecosystem. Polyhedra Network's specialized designs in cross-chain bridges overcome the limitations of networks lacking smart contract support.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To further enhance the dual staking mechanism, provide a seamless user experience, and increase the crypto-economic security of the system, Polyhedra Network integrates Renzo\u2019s ezETH, a leading Liquid Restaking Token (LRT). Renzo serves as the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem, securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs) and offering higher yields than traditional staking. By incorporating Renzo into the zkBridge and dual staking framework, the protocol abstracts the complexity from end-users, enabling easy collaboration between users and EigenLayer node operators.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The integration of Renzo offers several key benefits:<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The integration of Polyhedra Network's zkBridge, the dual staking mechanism and the Liquid Restaking Token powered by the EigenLayer, and Renzo, expands zkBridge\u2019s cross-chain interoperability, security, and user experience. The combination of zero-knowledge proofs, AVS,, and staking\/restaking functionality, enhanced crypto economic security through Renzo's LRT, and seamless user interaction sets a new standard for secure, efficient, and user-friendly cross-chain transactions. This approach opens new opportunities for decentralized finance and digital asset management on Bitcoin, fostering greater participation and collaboration within the blockchain ecosystem, and also generating yield for ZK token stakers.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Polyhedra Network is on a mission to deliver the fastest Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs to the Web3 industry, with the goal of becoming the underlying infrastructure for the entire ecosystem and the intersecting domains of Web2 and Web3. The team has designed and implemented many cutting-edge ZK protocols, forming a robust computation foundation that supports the entire blockchain world. Their flagship invention, zkBridge, is safe, fast, and does not require the trust of any third parties. To date, zkBridge has facilitated over 20 million cross-chain transactions across a network of more than 25 Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains, demonstrating their commitment to scalability and interoperability in Web3.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Renzo is the restaking hub of Eigenlayer built to streamline and expand access to the most intelligent Liquid Restaking strategies.
