El Salvador\u2019s lawmakers approved the $150 million fund in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/116200\/el-salvador-approves-150-million-trust-fund-to-support-bitcoin-ambitions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">late August<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, a few days before the nation officially made Bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar on Sept. 7.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Bukele said at the time that the fund had a surplus of $4 million due to increases in bitcoin\u2019s value.

However, questions remain about how the fund works.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Now, it appears the country has additional funds for the bitcoin schools. During his speech, Bukele said the fund now has a surplus of a couple million dollars more than when he announced the pet hospital a few weeks ago (El Salvador\u2019s presidential Twitter account <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PresidenciaSV\/status\/1455365925016936451\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">quoted this<\/span><\/a> <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">number as \u201Ca few\u201D million).

Using the pet hospitals will cost just 25 cents for any treatment, he said, which people can pay with their Chivo wallets. The first location will employ 300 people.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It also appears that El Salvador is planning additional pet hospitals outside the capital of San Salvador, which may potentially be funded with the surpluses from the bitcoin fund as well.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The same day of the school announcement, Bukele <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nayibbukele\/status\/1455378644570984449\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">shared a video clip<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> of himself on stage in a dimly-lit auditorium talking about his so-called Plan Cuscatlán, which involves the state creating three \u201Ccheap\u201D clinics in the country.
