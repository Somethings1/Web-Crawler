It ultimately will actually just be about gameplay in my opinion...it cannot be the main driver of play.\"","Turning in-game assets into NFTs solves a big problem for game developers and players, allowing holders of in-game assets to tap into their value.","\u201CGamers have been buying digital assets in games for decades, so this is essentially just the next step towards that evolution\u2026 I think that having the ability to invest the time, actually put money into the game to buy these assets, and then sort of have some guarantee that there will be some value coming out of the assets as well is pretty attractive\u201D.","As for hurdles such as gas fees, Wu said games in the early days might consider covering those costs as a way to acquire customers.","She suggested that future game developers may eventually consider fronting gas fees as a part of their user customer acquisition cost. \u201CWhat you have on the blockchain side is another way to acquire users,\u201D she said, adding, \u201CSome of the future gaming companies may think of fronting gas fees as another user acquisition cost and then it really brings down the cost to play to ideally free, actually.\"","© 2023 The Block.
