With the upgrade, token holders will be able to withdraw the ether they\u2019ve staked. The upgrade is also intended to make it easier to participate in the network\u2018s validation process while increasing security, lower fees and create more room for the network to handle more transactions.","While concerns linger that Ethereum\u2019s upgrade will cause a substantial withdrawal of ETH, Chen said that institutional investors see the event as more of a \u201Ctrust vote\u201D in the future of the blockchain.","He said RockX plans to \u201Cencourage some customers to withdraw\u201D some ether out of the 240,000 ETH the company has staked, to show that RockX trusts the network\u2019s upgrade.","From a technical perspective, Chen said the upgrade is a rather \u201Cboring and peaceful event.\u201D However, he said use cases for decentralized applications, or dapps, may soon become evident.","\u201CFrom the dapps or application layer, we\u2019re expecting a lot of innovative financial products, and also, different types of new products,\u201D he said.","Read more: Ethereum\u2019s Shanghai Upgrade: Here\u2019s Our Guide to Watch Parties, Blockchain Tools","Edited by Ben Schiller and Bradley Keoun."],"entity":[{"type":"Chen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"6:27 p.m.","content":"TIME"},{"type":"Ben Schiller","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Wednesday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Blockchain Tools","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Zhuling Chen","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"April 12","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Shanghai","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Bradley Keoun","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","Shanghai upgrade","Shapella","CoinDesk TV","ETH"],"authors":["Fran Velasquez"]}
