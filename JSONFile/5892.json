Since the night of the budget\u2019s approval, Capitol Hill has been effectively a ghost ship, hosting sporadic committee hearings and pro forma floor sessions that clock in at under 10 minutes.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Backstage, however, the Democrats of the House committees are meeting with their Senate counterparts to fill in that framework. They are running the numbers, both for the budget\u2019s accounts and legislative support. And they want to make sure that what they put out will pass both with minimal friction.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The package is under fairly tight deadlines, jammed between Labor Day and the fiscal year\u2019s beginning on October 1. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rollcall.com\/2021\/08\/25\/pelosi-pledges-coordination-with-senate-on-3-5t-budget-package\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that all relevant committees will have markups on the actual package done by September 15.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Keep in mind, the annual budget bill is an opportune time to push a legislative agenda. Rules set up in the twilight of the Nixon administration have established the budget as an omnibus package that the Senate cannot filibuster and which therefore can pass with simple, rather than two-thirds, majorities.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The formal process has barely begun. Only two House committees \u2014 Natural Resources and Oversight \u2014 held markups on Thursday, and neither is responsible for any of the major chunks of the budget. But otherwise, as of Thursday evening, the Congressional schedule between now and September 15 is blank.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Part of getting the initial budget framework passed in the House was wooing a renegade group of moderate Democrats who objected to its scale.

Ultimately, those involved need to balance the books convincingly. Given the scope of Biden\u2019s agenda, that is going to require some new revenue intake, which will entail going back to the Treasury\u2019s previously explained revenue wishlist.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Treasury\u2019s \u201CGeneral Explanations of the Administration\u2019s Revenue Proposals,\u201D or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/home.treasury.gov\/system\/files\/131\/General-Explanations-FY2022.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Green Book<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, lay out the administration\u2019s plans for where revenue will come from.
