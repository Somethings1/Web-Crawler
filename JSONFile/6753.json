When asked why it was launching a crypto-dedicated fund now, Maguire said many founders have increasingly asked Sequoia to take a more active role in managing its tokens. \"This new fund gives us the flexibility to engage even more deeply,\" he said.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">That means instead of just investing in and holding tokens, Sequoia will now start staking them, provide liquidity, participate in governance and trade them. \"Our network of builders at Ethereum, Solana, major DeFi protocols, and beyond have urged us to do the same,\" said Sequoia.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sequoia as a firm believes that crypto is more than a sector; it's a fundamental shift that will impact all sectors over the long run.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Michelle Bailhe, another crypto-focused partner at Sequoia, told The Block in the interview that \"it's day one for crypto,\" meaning crypto is still getting started and going to get only bigger from here.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Maguire concurred.
