Meanwhile, zkSync\u2019s Era mainnet, a product of ZK-Rollup technology, followed closely with 2250 ETH, equivalent to $4 million, securing its place at the second position.","Notably, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222596\/zksync-era-first-zkevm-goes-live-in-major-development-for-ethereum\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">zkSync Era<\/a> surpassed Optimism, another well-known Layer 2 solution, in performance for the first time. It\u2019s noteworthy that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230898\/optimism-mainnet-bedrock-upgrade\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Optimism<\/a> has consistently held a position within the top two regarding fee collection since the previous year. The recently observed fee structure represents a new peak in Layer 1 publishing costs across all three of the most widely used L2 networks.","This data fees spike is attributed to the rising transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet during the month. \u201CThe fees paid by L2s for publishing data to Ethereum have already hit a new high in May. The rise in gas costs we\u2019ve seen has made publishing more costly,\u201D Rebecca Stevens, research analyst at The Block, noted.","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/scaling-solutions\/scaling-overview\/ethereum-layer-2-l1-data-fees\/embed\" title=\"Ethereum Layer 2 L1 Data Fees\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","In May, Ethereum's average transaction fees <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/229508\/ethereum-gas-price-high-memecoin-hype\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">hit levels<\/a> last seen the previous year. In this context, Layer 2 solutions, which are based on rollup technologies, are particularly useful. They process transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain, thereby providing a more affordable method for transaction execution.","These rollups are required to publish security proofs and other metadata to the Ethereum mainnet, using revenue generated from users\u2019 transaction fees. However, the publishing fees incurred would still be significantly cheaper compared to those on the mainnet.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
