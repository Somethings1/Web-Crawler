The definition for retail is so broad, the commissioner noted, that it includes people who make less than $50,000 in the markets to hedge funds that make millions of dollars.","\u201CWhat I propose is that we break that definition of retail in two, and then we can target rules and regulations to regular household people that may not be needed for a hedge fund or a millionaire. And then we can expand access,\u201D Goldsmith Romero said. \u201CThere's a great opportunity to expand access to financial markets.\u201D<span class=\"x_apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The growing digital asset market was the catalyst for Goldsmith Romero\u2019s new proposal, the commissioner told The Block in a telephone interview.

Goldsmith Romero said her goal is to expand access to financial markets for regular people, and that she was driven by President Joe Biden\u2019s executive order on digital assets.<span class=\"x_apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","\u201CIf we continue to think of retail as including hedge funds, as including, you know, someone with up to $10 million, some millionaire with eight, nine, ten million dollars, we\u2019re not really targeting our customer protections in a way that is going to be safe and affordable,\u201D Goldsmith Romero said.<span class=\"x_apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The CFTC commissioner plans to release a written proposal soon and will seek input from the public and policymakers on what a new definition should look like.<span class=\"x_apple-converted-space\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;<\/span>","The Democratic commissioner first mentioned her plan at the Financial Markets Quality Conference hosted by Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. Goldsmith Romero appeared with Securities and Exchange Commissioner Mark Uyeda, a Republican appointee.&nbsp;","The hourlong discussion also touched on other aspects of digital assets.
