The funding round also drew a range of angel investors from around the digital asset ecosystem, including protocol founders like Aave\u2019s Stanislav Kulechov, Aragon\u2019s Luis Cuende and Gnosis\u2019s Stefan George, among others.","In an interview, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.duneanalytics.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Dune<\/a> co-founder Fredrik Haga traced the startup\u2019s history back to experiments between him and co-founder Mats Julian Olsen during their time together at a Norway-based media company.

Though the premium services preceded Dune\u2019s community offering, it was the latter that Haga credited as a major force behind Dune\u2019s recent growth.","\u201CThe key insight we\u2019ve had along the way that\u2019s made Dune so powerful is that when you open it up and just say, \u2018This is free and open to the community\u2019 and people can build on each other,\u201D he told The Block. \u201CThat turns into something very powerful, as opposed to sort of a walled garden where only you internally or the customers alone in the siloed fashion interact with the data.\u201D","Among those customers are the seed round investors themselves, who Haga said were \u201Ceasy to reach out to and convince once we had this momentum that we have now.\u201D","Haga went on to say that the funds would be used to scale the team to support the growth of the site and, more specifically, meet the demands of an expanding user base.","\u201CWe\u2019re in the position where people are begging us for features, and as a two-man team, we simply can\u2019t deliver on the things our users want,\u201D said Haga. \u201CIt was very obvious that we would need to scale up the team to serve the demand we\u2019re seeing.\u201D","\u201CWe\u2019ll definitely be a bigger team,\u201D he said when asked about the one-year outlook, post-funding. \u201CStill fairly contained. Like, a two-pizza team, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201D","Haga added that \u201C[w]e still think there\u2019s a lot of power and building tooling that the community can leverage.\u201D","\u201CSo I think, really, growing the team and building more powerful tooling for the community,\u201D he went on to say. \u201CHaving a product that\u2019s more engaging, easier to get started with, and also that allows you to do more powerful analysis and interact with others in an easier manner than you can today.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
