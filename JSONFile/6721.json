The passports act as a digital identity on blockchain to ensure votes are \u201Cimmutable, traceable and protected from tampering or undue influence,\u201D it said.","The idea is that eligibility can be verified while maintaining voters' anonymity in participating in political decision-making, empowering every passport holder to propose, vote on and directly implement policies.","Straying from conventional left-right politics, The Other Party said it positions itself as a neutral facilitator of the people's will, adding any elected representatives of the party would be legally obligated to follow decisions made by their constituents rather than a party line.","\u201CThis isn't just about politics; it's about empowering every individual to actively shape our society. The Other Party is a movement for those who believe in a future where democracy is truly by the people, for the people,\u201D Ryder added.","The Other Party has also introduced a POD (Proof Of Donation) memorabilia token, which is supposed to act as a \u201Cdigital sticker,\u201D <a href=\"https:\/\/www.otherparty.co.uk\/pod-token-the-other-party\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">according<\/a> to its website. The tokens are <a href=\"https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xE90CE7764d8401d19ed3733a211bd3b06c631Bc0\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued<\/a> on the Ethereum blockchain and are available via the decentralized exchange Uniswap.","POD has a fixed supply of around 3.5 trillion, purportedly mirroring the total amount of pound sterling in <a href=\"https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/united-kingdom\/money-supply-m3\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">circulation<\/a>. The token does not have any utility or value, according to The Other Party. However, \u201Cjust like stickers, leaflets, letters or other political memorabilia, we don\u2019t want to hinder our donors from attempting to transact in their proof of donation token if there is a secondary market and they do become collectible or desirable as memorabilia,\u201D its website reads.","The Other Party\u2019s website also provides a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.electoralcommission.org.uk\/who-we-are-and-what-we-do\/political-party-registration\/party-registration-decisions\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">link<\/a> to view its party registration on the UK electoral regulator The Electoral Commission\u2019s website. However, its registration details are not yet visible on the site at the time of publication and its initial application appears to have been rejected on Nov. 28. Current applications were last updated on Dec. 7. The Other Party did not respond to a request for comment from The Block on the current status of its registration.","The Other Party is not alone in being keen on leveraging blockchain technology in the country. In June, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak expressed a desire to provide regulatory clarity regarding how crypto businesses should register and operate in the UK, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/234095\/a16z-uk-expansion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">announcing<\/a> plans to turn the country into a web3 hub.","Last month, UK Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/264389\/uk-finance-minister-announces-legislation-to-boost-the-nations-digital-asset-sector\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">outlined<\/a> legislation to expand the country\u2019s digital assets sector via its Digital Securities Sandbox initiative \u2014 which aims to facilitate the adoption of digital assets across financial markets \u2014 expected to begin in Q1, 2024.","The UK\u2019s stance contrasts somewhat with the crypto environment in the U.S., with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stating in June that the U.S. regulatory environment was \u201Churting America\u2019s economic competitiveness,\u201D responding to the Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233270\/sec-sues-coinbase-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">lawsuit<\/a> against the crypto exchange for alleged securities violations.","This week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told Sen.
