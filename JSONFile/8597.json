This increases the deposit time from roughly 40 minutes to around 2.5 hours. The goal is to reduce the risk of double spending that emerges when a single entity controls at least 51% of the hash rate on a proof-of-work blockchain.","It has also moved its Zcash trading pairs into \u201Climit only\u201D mode, meaning traders can\u2019t place market bids. The exchange stated this would minimize the impact of any volatility \u2014 likely in the event of large sales made as part of a double-spend attack.","Coinbase further reached out to Electric Coin Company, the creator of Zcash, and the relevant mining pool, ViaBTC, with its concerns. \"<span class=\"sc-3cb1a032-0 fQNGSi\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">We shared our concerns around the risks of mining centralization and provided recommendations for various options that either party could implement to reduce the risk of a 51% attack,\" the exchange said.<\/span>","The Electric Coin Company <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ElectricCoinCo\/status\/1704240109267153237\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">confirmed<\/a> the discussions, adding that its proposal to introduce a step named the \u201CTrailing Finality Layer,\u201D could address the issue.

This implies that, in theory, if the mining pool decided to act with ill intent, it could carry out double spending attacks or exhibit other malicious behavior.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">ViaBTC now represents 53.8% of the Zcash's hash rate.

Such pools comprise numerous miners who aggregate their resources to achieve a steadier income stream.
