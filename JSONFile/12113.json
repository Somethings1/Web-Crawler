This type of loan does not require the borrower to put up collateral that is equal to or greater than the value of the loan. As such, it can be a capital-efficient form of borrowing.","Friktion\u2019s crypto lending will offer enhanced lender protection, the company said. The lending product will comprise tranched pools ranging from junior tranches to senior tranches. Junior tranches will offer higher annualized yields of between 11% and 17% in return for covering senior lenders against loan defaults. Loan pools will also feature a diverse cast of borrowers to reduce counterparty risks. Lenders in the senior pool can earn annualized yields of between 8% and 10%.","Commenting on its risk-management strategy, the company told The Block that third-party underwriters called \u201Cconductors\u201D will do due-diligence checks on borrowers before launching loan pools.","\u201CThroughout the tenure of the loan pool, conductors will also perform real-time risk monitoring of borrowers\u2019 positions both on exchanges and on-chain,\u201D the company told The Block, adding, \u201CIn an unlikely event of default, the junior pool serves as first loss capital and provides default protection to the senior pool.\u201D","Under-collateralized loans pose significant risks for lenders, especially when borrowers are unable to repay them. Indeed, under-collateralized lending and the crypto bear market collapse led to bankruptcies of the likes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172351\/celsius-investors-file-for-fiduciary-to-advocate-for-them-in-bankruptcy-case\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Celsius<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/168264\/bankrupt-voyager-digital-to-hold-asset-auction-on-september-13\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Voyager<\/a>.","DeFi lending, on the other hand, is primarily over-collateralized. Most of the major DeFi lenders like Aave and Compound require borrowers to put up collateral in excess of the loan amount. According to Friktion, this collateral requirement presents a significant barrier for institutional players in the DeFi lending space amid concerns about capital efficiency. These concerns are further worsened by the current decline in DeFi yield due to the year-long crypto bear market.","Despite these problems, Friktion says there is a growing demand for institutional DeFi credit, especially under-collateralized stablecoin loans that offer capital efficiency for borrowers.","\u201CAs adoption from sophisticated market participants continues to grow, there is a natural demand for institutional-grade lending solutions that provide enhanced transparency, risk management, and lender protection,\u201D the company said, adding, \u201CThis is a positive signal which not only indicates recovering sentiment but also demonstrates the maturation within the crypto lending market.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
