LEXIS 123336 (D.W.D.Ok., CIV-18\u20131096-PRW, 7\/24\/2019) [SDP]<\/strong><\/em>","If you get sued and legally served with process, the Court will enter something called a default judgment against you. The idea is that you have sufficient notice of claims and can\u2019t be bothered to defend against them, you\u2019ll be found liable and you\u2019ll end up with a judgment against you. While liability is one thing, damages are another, and as this case shows, the plaintiff doesn\u2019t always get everything they want.","Plaintiff sued Bitcoin Market, LLC, and Dustin and Tiffany Dollar in late 2018. They never answered or moved to dismiss. Plaintiff says he is owed damages in the amount of 75 bitcoin, \u201Cthe value of his lack of access to his bitcoin, $1,000 and his attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201D","The Court held an evidentiary hearing on plaintiff\u2019s default judgment and held that he is entitled to damages \u201Cin the amount of $723,143.50. This award is based on the following calculations: (1) the value of 75 bitcoin as of the date of entry of judgment (75 x $9,628.5810); plus (2) $1,000.00 representing the amount Plaintiff transferred to be held in his Bitcoin Market account.\u201D To determine the value of bitcoin on that date, the Court averaged prices from CEX-IO and Coinbase, which were $9,627.70 and $9,629.46, respectively.","The Court said that plaintiff wasn\u2019t entitled to damages for lack of access to his bitcoin because that wasn\u2019t foreseeable at the time of contracting. Also, plaintiff wasn\u2019t entitled to attorneys fees and costs because there\u2019s no statutory right to them and plaintiff didn\u2019t identify a contract provision that established this entitlement. (As a general rule, the prevailing party in U.S. litigation doesn\u2019t get reimbursed for attorney\u2019s fees absent a statute or contract that awards \u2019em \u2014 this is known, fittingly, as \u201Cthe American Rule.\u201D)","It\u2019s kind of interesting that the Court selected the date of the default judgment as the date to fix damages. I suppose it\u2019s good fortune that the default and damages were calculated in July of this year instead of March.","<em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block is pleased to bring you expert cryptocurrency legal analysis courtesy of Stephen Palley&nbsp;(<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stephendpalley\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">@stephendpalley<\/a>) and Nelson M.
