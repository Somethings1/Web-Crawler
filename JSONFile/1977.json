Those creditors, specifically, are in a slightly better position than the overall pool of creditors because of collateral that Genesis posted to Gemini as part of their business relationship. Genesis posted about 31 million of shares of GBTC as collateral, which has appreciated significantly and represents about 60% of the total balance owed to Earn clients, DCG representatives noted.&nbsp;","In total, Gemini Earn creditors could receive as much as 110% of their claim.&nbsp;","\"At current pricing, the Gemini User Collateral is worth approximately $607 million,\" the agreement notes. \"If Gemini agrees to provide $100 million to Gemini Earn users under the Proposed Agreement, as it previously did, or to distribute even a small portion of the Gemini User Collateral to Gemini Earn users, there would be little doubt Gemini Earn users would receive a full recovery,\" the firm said referring to a previous promise in February by Gemini to contribute to a potential shortfall.&nbsp;","DCG contends that Gemini is failing to \"put its money where its mouth is,\" noting in the filing that the firm \"is not contributing a single penny to provide Gemini Earn users a better recovery.\"","The remainder balance could be met by assets held by Genesis, including cash, stablecoins, and payments made to the firm by DCG as part of longer termed notes.&nbsp;","\"DCG is extremely proud of the deal it was able to achieve with the Debtors and the UCC, and believes the rightful owners of claims, including, importantly, Gemini Earn users, should have the opportunity to vote on the deal,\" DCG said.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["BANKRUPTCY FILINGS","COURT HEARINGS","LAWSUITS"]}
