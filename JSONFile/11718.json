In April, SEC Chair Gary Gensler refused to say whether ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was a security during a nearly five-hour hearing. Earlier this year, Gensler told New York Magazine that \"everything other than bitcoin\" is a security.","The SEC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233154\/sec-files-suit-against-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">alleged<\/a> in the lawsuit that Binance and affiliated companies repeatedly lied to customers and misdirected funds to a separate investment fund owned by Zhao, in an echo of similar accusations against Binance's former rival FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The SEC enforcement action follows a similar suit filed in March by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission against Binance.","The price of bitcoin, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233151\/binance-coin-price-tumbles-as-sec-files-lawsuit-against-crypto-exchange-giant?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BNB<\/a> and other tokens have declined since the news of the lawsuit broke.&nbsp;","Â© 2023 The Block.
