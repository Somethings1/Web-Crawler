It outlined at least ten areas that it wants to know about, such as:","Since China revealed the crackdown on crypto mining in May, a total of seven provinces that had notable amount of mining operations have launched relevant measures. The Hebei province is the latest one to form a special task force to normalize the efforts.","While the crackdown had a strong chilling effect at the beginning, which resulted in Bitcoin and Ethereum's hash rates plunging, some Chinese miners have gradually found ways to resume operations secretly over the past two months as things cooled off.","But with provincial governments aiming to scale up their knowledge and responding mechanism, it appears there will be a tug of war in the foreseeable future between law enforcement and local crypto miners.","Â© 2023 The Block.
