A halving is a programmed event that occurs approximately every four years, reducing the number of new bitcoins entering circulation by half. The 2024 halving will reduce the per-block reward to 3.125 bitcoins from the current 6.25 bitcoins per block. Such significant reductions in the flow of new supply result in a higher stock-to-flow ratio, effectively increasing bitcoin's scarcity and potentially its price.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The 2020 halving reduced the supply of new bitcoins by 43% relative to the previous halving. It had a 23% as big an impact on price,\" Pantera Capital said. \"The next halving is expected to occur on April 20, 2024. Since most bitcoins are now in circulation, each halving will be almost exactly half as big a reduction in new supply. If history were to repeat itself, the next halving would see bitcoin rising to $35k before the halving and $148k after,\" it added.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Besides the bitcoin halving event being a positive catalyst for the next year, the recent&nbsp;<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/239474\/ripples-xrp-token-surges-28-as-court-issues-ruling-sends-case-to-trial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">XRP ruling<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;and a bitcoin ETF application by&nbsp;<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/240716\/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-long-shot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">BlackRock<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;provide a \"strong setup for the next bull market for digital assets,\" according to Pantera Capital.<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"Our view is that we've seen enough \u2014 there's just so long markets can be down,\" the firm said. \"We would then see a rally into early 2024 and then a strong rally after the actual halving.\"<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
