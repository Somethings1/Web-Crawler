While it has been described as a stablecoin, the team avoids the use of the term \u2014&nbsp;instead preferring the term a \u201Csynthetic dollar.\u201D George Calle, VP of Research at The Block, stressed that Ethena\u2019s USDe is essentially a tokenized representation of the cash and carry arbitrage present in crypto markets. As such, it generates yield by shorting ether futures and staking ether.&nbsp;<\/span>","The project's advertised yields of up to 27% have enticed users to mint around $420 million USDe tokens so far, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/ethena-usde\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CoinGecko data<\/a>. Though the project initially paid out only 15% of its first-week yield to holders, it <a href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/ethena_labs\/status\/1761029371186561289?s=20\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">quickly reversed course<\/a> following backlash, paying out the entire 24% yield generated by its assets instead of reserving funds for core team operations.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">This growing market share has raised concerns that, as it rises in market share, the yield of the protocol could fall considerably.

He explained that such a scenario would see market participants opt out of staking their USDe. If they do that, he said, this would allow the funding rate to revert to a new equilibrium.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He added that a more concerning situation would be if the protocol made up around 30% to 40% of ether perpetual futures open interest. \"That's when a product like Ethena starts to come into more serious capacity constraints,\" he added.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Calle noted that Ethena\u2019s design will likely put downward pressure on funding rates but said this doesn\u2019t post questions around solvency or systemic risk. Instead, it raises the question of how much capital the protocol can take in before yields shrink to levels that are unattractive to token holders.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One of crypto\u2019s biggest collapses was the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/266389\/terraform-labs-asks-judge-to-let-jury-decide-if-ust-and-luna-tokens-are-securities\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">luna<\/a> token and its sister token UST, which was a stablecoin that offered high yields of nearly 20%. Due to this high-level similarity, there have been many comparisons between UST and USDe.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Yet Calle argued that this comparison is misplaced. He noted that historically, crypto markets have featured positive funding rates and that Ethena\u2019s strategy is to create a delta neutral position that captures this positive funding rate \u2014 with a dash of staking yield thrown in.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CGiven the 20-40% annual yield that this strategy projects at current funding rates, many have falsely equated the strategy to previous algorithmic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/275448\/stablecoins-yield-ondo-coo\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stablecoins<\/a> like Terra that infamously advertised ~20% yield on UST,\u201D Calle said. \u201CHowever, Terra was designed in a way that was dependent on perpetual capital inflows to prevent the inevitable death spiral experienced in May 2022, while Ethena can exist safely even if yield or the total value locked in the protocol is reduced.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Calle added that the protocol's mechanism can actually generate positive yield even during periods of negative funding rates, as long as the negative funding cost does not outweigh positive <span class=\"articleTooltip\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><a href=\"\/price\/248349\/ethereum-eth-usd\" class=\"articleTooltip__link\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.tbstat.com\/wp\/uploads\/2023\/10\/ethereum.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"articleTooltip__tokenImage\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\"> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">ETH<\/span> <span class=\"articleTooltip__tokenText articleTooltip__tokenText_price articleTooltip__tokenText_negative\" data-v-baf5685a=\"\">\n      -0.49%\n    <\/span><\/a> <!----><\/span> staking yield.
