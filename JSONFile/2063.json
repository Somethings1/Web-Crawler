These app-chains will operate as \u201CLayer 3s\u201D in the Starknet ecosystem.","Layer 3 will be able to utilize Avail for data availability in a variety of modes, according to a statement. These modes include validium and sovereign rollups, each offering unique benefits in terms of transaction processing efficiency and finality.","The infrastructure will be available for Madara chains to be used after the mainnet release, scheduled for Q1 2024. Currently, developers can begin experimenting with the data availability interface for Madara on the testnet.","\u201CMadara is not just a sequencer; it\u2019s a transformative tool that allows for the creation of bespoke appchains, providing massive cost reductions, personalized control, and a realm of innovation previously unattainable in blockchain infrastructure,\u201D said Starknet exploration lead Abdelhamid Bakhta.","StarkWare\u2019s multi-layer thesis presents Layer 2 blockchains as a \u201Cgeneral purpose\u201D scalability solution for Ethereum, with Layer 3s offering customization and experimentation at lower costs without needing to build on top of Ethereum\u2019s Layer 1 directly.","In this context, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/141116\/polygon-releases-testnet-plans-for-a-new-scalability-focused-blockchain-called-avail\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Avail<\/a> aims to further optimize costs and performance for these Layer 3s, which eventually settle transactions on Starknet\u2019s Layer 2 before achieving finality on Ethereum.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/141116\/polygon-releases-testnet-plans-for-a-new-scalability-focused-blockchain-called-avail\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Avail<\/a> began as a modular blockchain project at Ethereum scalability developers Polygon Labs in 2020, with a data availability layer designed to scale blockchain networks.
