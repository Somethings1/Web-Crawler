It\u2019s an issue that has been ascendant in public awareness as miners have flooded into the US over the past year. Its political dimension has become especially conspicuous in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/130633\/congressional-committee-releases-witness-list-in-advance-of-crypto-mining-hearing\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">aftermath of a hearing<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> before the Oversight Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee earlier in January.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Soto, a member of the full Energy Committee and a co-chair of the Blockchain Caucus, rushed from votes to join the subcommittee in its questioning of several leaders in crypto mining. Presiding remotely, subcommittee chair Dianna DeGette (D-CO) almost passed him over.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As congressional attention on crypto has intensified \u2014 particularly in the form of more frequent hearings on the subject \u2014 the industry has been at odds trying to come to terms with its new popularity on Capitol Hill. <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Effectively, what does it all mean? Is this a prelude to a crackdown?&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Not in the form of legislation, according to Soto. \u201CIt could be months but more likely years before there are any statutory moves,\u201D he says. \u201CThere is no pending legislation right now.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Rather than heralding a crackdown, the mining hearing was more in line with the Energy Committee\u2019s work on the energy grid across industries. Other recent hearings have raised questions about the resilience of US oil pipelines and the future of domestic wind energy.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere are other industries using far more energy that we\u2019ve been looking at for years,\" says Soto. \"We\u2019re going down the list of energy users: transportation, manufacturing, utilities.\u201D <\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It is a mark of the crypto industry\u2019s development that it is on this list, according to Soto. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CCrypto has become a more mature industry,\" he says. \"There\u2019s not a partisan disagreement as to whether mining should happen, it\u2019s more a question of \u2018how do we protect the environment\u2019\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In an interview with The Block, Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA) tried to illustrate that sense of agreement across the aisle. Energy use is \u201Csomething we should be concerned about,\" Griffith said. \"Do we shut the industry down because of that? Absolutely not. We have to figure out ways to do it better.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For now, legislation at the federal level remains unlikely. As The Block has reported, pending revisions of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/131077\/no-fireworks-at-houses-bitcoin-mining-hearing-but-pending-climate-bills-could-home-in-on-crypto\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Build Back Better Act<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> could target crypto mining within its climate provisions. But it is procedurally limited in new rules that it can put into place.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As Soto notes, \u201CGrants fit well, because it\u2019s a budget bill, but regulation would in all likelihood have to come primarily in the form of incentives.\u201D<\/span>","The current oversight of crypto mining is most meaningful in establishing a general spectrum of good and bad actors. Then, Congress can turn up political pressure on miners to act more like the former and less like the latter, which it can do without passing new laws.","However, federal lawmakers will certainly be looking out for responses from states with large mining industries to gauge any prospective nationwide response.","So, if for instance, Bitcoin mining ends up funding the expansion of stranded wind turbine farms in West Texas, that might score points for the industry in DC.
