A key question is how the shift to a proof-of-stake system, which is supposed to be faster and more energy-efficient than the current proof-of-work protocol, will affect prices for ether (ETH) and related digital assets.","With the event now expected next month, the market narrative keeps twisting.","According to a weekly report from the data provider Kaiko, ether\u2019s steep price plunge on Friday brought a swift decline in open interest on derivatives \u2013 contracts that traders used to make leveraged bets on the cryptocurrency\u2019s future price. Many traders had their derivatives trades liquidated, or wiped out due to margin calls, according to Kaiko.","But on Monday, money flooded back into the ETH futures market, Kaiko found.","\u201CAs the price dipped below $1,600, we observed a significant spike in open interest,\u201D Kaiko wrote.","There has also been plenty of movement in funding rates on ether perpetual contracts, which are similar to futures contracts on commodities but without expiration dates. The funding rates recovered to near-neutral levels after dipping alongside the token\u2019s price.","\u201CWhen combined with the spike in open interest we observed this morning, it seems these new positions in ETH futures are biased long and investors are bullish at these price levels,\u201D Kaiko wrote.","Separately, ether\u2019s share of the weekly, combined trading volume of ether and bitcoin hit 57%, the highest since 2018. This trading activity exceeded the previous peak of 55% during the May 2021 crypto sell-off.","\u201CThe main driver of ETH trading activity in July has been increased optimism around the Merge and an improvement of global risk sentiment. However, last week\u2019s sell-off across markets confirms that ETH remains a higher beta play,\u201D Kaiko wrote.","There\u2019s ample speculation that many Ethereum miners might try to keep supporting a proof-of-work, which the blockchain currently uses, as does Bitcoin. Ethereum Classic and ETHPOW \u2013 based on a new, theoretical fork that might take place \u2013 have been touted as possible choices as the Merge approaches.","According to Kaiko, the ethereum classic (ETC) token has outperformed tokens of other forks, such as bitcoin cash (BCH), as well as ETH and BTC for the year to date. However, ETC recently retraced gains, falling over 20% over the past week.","ETHPOW\u2019s price, meanwhile, has fallen over 60% from a high of $140 at the beginning of August to around $50. The token\u2019s daily volume dropped 66% after its first week going live, as traders\u2019 appetites fizzled out.","While some Ethereum Merge concerns such as further delays, an unsuccessful transition and proof-of-work fork competitors remain amongst traders, Arca Research Analyst Nick Hotz says that most of the concerns are overblown.","\u201CThree Ethereum testnets (Ropsten, Sepolia and Goerli) and nine \u2019shadow forks\u2019 have merged successfully,\u201D Hotz wrote. \u201CMany of the hiccups seen in testing arose from the fact that these tests were not the real thing, whereas the actual Ethereum merge probably would have gone smoothly.\u201D","Once Ethereum reaches a specific total terminal difficulty (TTD), or amount of computing power dedicated to the network, the Merge will happen. Right now, the Merge is estimated to be around Sept. 15.","\u201CWhen the TTD is reached, Ethereum will switch to proof-of-stake, regardless of any hiccups,\u201D Hotz wrote.","Read more: Is Ethereum's Merge Priced-In?"],"entity":[{"type":"Arca Research","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"this morning","content":"TIME"},{"type":"BCH","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$50","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Hotz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Kaiko","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"20%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"July","content":"DATE"},{"type":"66%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"2018","content":"DATE"},{"type":"60%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Monday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"57%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Sept. 15","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Friday","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$140","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"August","content":"DATE"},{"type":"$1,600","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"May 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Nick Hotz","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"TTD","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"55%","content":"PERCENT"},{"type":"Ethereum Merge","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"ETC","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Ethereum","The Merge","Investing","Proof-of-Stake","Ether","Ether Futures"],"authors":["Jimmy He"]}
