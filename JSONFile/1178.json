It lets users associate human-readable names, like \"bob.eth,\" with long and complex Ethereum addresses, mirroring DNS functionality in website URLs.","GoDaddy noted the collaboration would allow users to connect their domain (such as a .com) to their ENS-compatible crypto wallet. \u201CCrypto payments have never been easier to receive,\u201D the firm <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GoDaddy\/status\/1754558153008538108\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a>.&nbsp;","\"By pairing up ENS names and GoDaddy domains, we will streamline the way users interact with web domains, blending the familiarity of the DNS with the potential of blockchain technology,\" said Nick Johnson, founder of ENS.","The collaboration addresses previous barriers like high gas fees by deploying new smart contracts for cost-free DNS to ENS domain linking, improving the transition process.","ENS has been making efforts to bridge with the traditional web.
