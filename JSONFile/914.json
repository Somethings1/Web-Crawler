The two have since embarked on a project to build Sony's own blockchain network, which Watanabe described as \u201Cvery intensive and very important.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201COur focus is going to be mass adoption,\u201D said Watanabe, who added that Astar\u2019s goal is to prove the utility of web3 to the general public. \u201CTheoretically, we can build [a] public blockchain which is used by the most [number of] people, onboarding beyond web3 people into the blockchain space because Sony has tremendous touchpoints.\u201D<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Sony, the maker of PlayStation, has already <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ppubs.uspto.gov\/dirsearch-public\/print\/downloadPdf\/20240066408\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">filed<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> a patent for its concept of \u201Csuper-fungible tokens\u201D for transferring NFTs on a blockchain in a gaming ecosystem. Watanabe, however, mentioned that the blockchain under development would not have just one focus area, such as gaming or NFTs.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In response to a query on how Japan\u2019s new <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238030\/circle-chief-considers-issuing-stablecoin-in-japan-coindesk\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stablecoin regulations<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> have affected Astar projects, Watanabe answered that the company is talking to various banks and companies but declined to reveal further details. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CIt\u2019s a little bit tough at the moment for us to disclose some of the critical information, but all things are going to make sense for everyone once we make the announcement in the coming months,\u201D Watanabe said.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Astar Network, a smart contract platform supporting both EVM and WebAssembly environments, has previously worked with a list of major conglomerates in Japan, including Toyota, NTT Docomo and SoftBank.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Earlier this month, the network also launched a zkEVM network based on Polygon\u2019s AggLayer, which allows cross-chain transactions between Astar and Polygon by using shared liquidity. The impact of AggLayer will grow as more partners join the chain-abstracting solution, Watanabe told The Block.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Watanabe, who previously said that he views blockchain as a business, reiterated that such an aspect of blockchain is undervalued in its potential to change the web3 space.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI do believe that tech is going to change the world, but I also view that tech is too emphasized. Technology itself is not going to change things,\u201D said Watanabe, who highlighted that marketing the positive elements of web3 to politicians and the public is crucial.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Watanabe said that his ability to build the narrative around web3 utility and present it to the country\u2019s rulemakers is one of Astar\u2019s main strengths, as regulation plays a major role in changing the society to become more accepting of Web3 technology.<\/span>"],"hashtag":["ASIA","ASIAN PARLIAMENTS"]}
