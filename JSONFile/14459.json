Please upgrade ASAP to help us start analyzing the effects of the proposed congestion fixes,\u201D Anza <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/anza_xyz\/status\/1778626752056803546\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a>.","Anza, the developer of one of Solana\u2019s Agave validator clients, urged Solana testnet validators to quickly adopt the new version. This step is essential for the team to evaluate the release, allowing for necessary adjustments before the update is implemented on the mainnet.","Recently, Solana has experienced significant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/286868\/solana-network-congestion\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">congestion<\/a>, linked to spam transactions. Such congestion has led to slower transaction processing and higher transaction drop rates, impacting the overall user experience.","Solana\u2019s unique architecture, which processes transactions directly without a mempool, is another factor at play. The developers are working on multiple solutions to tackle the matter. Anza previously <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/anza_xyz\/status\/1776347491195388156\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stated<\/a> it was working on fixes addressing specific issues related to the network's QUIC implementation.","Phantom, Solana\u2019s most widely used wallet, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/phantom\/status\/1778535513441652797\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">noted<\/a> that transaction success rates have improved a lot already ahead of the patch. The project stated its metrics showed that transactions were successful nearly 90% of the time, which is almost a fivefold improvement from a week ago.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
