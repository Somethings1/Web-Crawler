Kwon has agreed to be extradited to South Korea, but the Minister of Justice of Montenegro will make a final decision on which country takes precedence for extradition, the court added.","If the minister approves, Kwon will be extradited after serving a 4-month prison sentence in Montenegro for document forgery, the court said.","Kwon was initially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/222286\/do-kwon-terra-luna-arrested-montenegro\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">arrested<\/a> in Montenegro in March when charged with using a fake passport to attempt to leave the country. However, he was freed from jail pending trial after a court agreed to a $436,000 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/230575\/do-kwon-bail\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">bail<\/a> in May. Subsequently, in June, a Montenegro court sentenced him to four months in prison after finding him <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/235448\/do-kwon-found-guilty-in-montenegro-fake-passport-case\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">guilty<\/a> of document forgery. Kwon appealed that court decision, lost the appeal, and was finally sentenced to four months in jail earlier this month.","Kwon was the focus of a worldwide search in September 2022 when global police body Interpol reportedly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/172739\/south-korea-says-interpol-has-issued-a-red-notice-for-do-kwon-bloomberg-says\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">issued<\/a> a so-called red notice for him, stemming from the May 2022 collapse of the two tokens he had created \u2014 TerraUSD and Luna \u2014 which wiped out some $40 billion of investor wealth in a few days.","In April of this year, Terraform's other co-founder, Daniel Shin, was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/238561\/seoul-court-holds-first-hearing-for-terra-co-founder-daniel-shin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">indicted<\/a> in South Korea for violating capital markets laws, leading to prosecutors freezing $185 million in assets. Shin, however, denied any involvement in the Terra collapse, asserting that he had left the company two years before it occurred.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
