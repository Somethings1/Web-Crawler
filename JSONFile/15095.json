By 2030, according to the Citi report, up to $5 trillion worth of CBDCs could be circulating in major economies across the world, half of which would be tied to distributed ledger technology.","\u201CCBDCs will be a Trojan horse,\u201D Ghose told CoinDesk TV\u2019s \u201CFirst Mover\u201D on Wednesday, referring to how using the digital currency will get more people comfortable using blockchain.
