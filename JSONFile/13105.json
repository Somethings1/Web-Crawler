Paladin stated an hour before the presale that Orion\u2019s smart contract was similar to one previously deployed by serial scammers.&nbsp;","\u201CIt wasn\u2019t exactly a smoking gun, at this point, I was judging the odds of them rugging at 30%,\u201D Paladin told The Block. The security researcher stated that the similarities in the contracts could have been a coincidence.","\u201CBut as I said previously, this is already a losing game, if your odds decrease further you should just stay out.
