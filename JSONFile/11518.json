It will be executed in a day's time.","This may be a swift ending to a ruthless governance takeover that didn't affect the protocol \u2014 although it could have done \u2014 but resulted in the theft of some governance tokens. According to Martin Lee, data journalist at crypto analytics site Nansen, the attacker <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/themlpx\/status\/1660592318901272577\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stole<\/a> 483,000 TORN tokens and swapped most of them for 485 ETH ($890,000), leaving 39,000 TORN ($160,000). Some of the ether was then routed through Tornado Cash, to obscure its origin.","The attacker <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/231637\/attacker-uses-malicious-proposal-to-take-over-tornado-cash-governance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">took over<\/a> the protocol's governance system by managing to get a malicious proposal passed, which contained code giving them 1.2 million votes. They then used these votes to pass further proposals, handing themselves control over governance tokens that had been vested.","Tornado Cash is a mixing service on the Ethereum blockchain. It was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/162105\/us-treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-mixer-tornado-cash\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sanctioned<\/a> by the U.S. Treasury in August 2022 under allegations that the protocol was used for money laundering. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/227329\/alexey-pertsev-tornado-cash-developer-free-pending-trial\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Alexey Pertsev<\/a>, one of the protocol's developers, awaits trial in the Netherlands under allegations of money laundering.","Â© 2023 The Block.
