The hacker removed around 114 million walbt, AllianceBlock's wrapped native token, and 98 million beur tokens from one of BonqDAO's <a href=\"https:\/\/bonq-docs.gitbook.io\/protocol-overview\/protocol-documentation\/welcome-to-bonq\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">troves<\/a>.

Both teams worked on removing liquidity to mitigate the hacker converting the stolen tokens into other assets, and have stopped all exchange trading.
