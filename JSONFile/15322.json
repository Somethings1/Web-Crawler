Kwon fled to Montenegro after Terra\u2019s failure but was arrested on charges of possession of falsified official documents. He is serving a sentence of four months in prison while the country approves his extradition and decides the destination.","The U.S. and South Korean governments have asked for Kwon\u2019s extradition for his role in Terra\u2019s implosion.","According to the announcement, the case is heading for a retrial because \"there are no clear and valid reasons for decisive facts regarding the order of arrival of requests\" for extradition from the U.S. and South Korea.","The Terraform Labs co-founder\u2019s lawyer, Goran Rodic, has previously told CoinDesk that local courts were facing political pressure in order to push the extradition through.","The latest legal victory for Kwon doesn't necessarily mean that he cannot be extradited at all. The case will be heard again by the court that initially adjudicated on the matter. Therefore, for the time being, the extradition of Kwon is delayed, if not cancelled.","In early February, Kwon\u2019s former CFO at Terraform, Han Chang-Joon, was extradited to South Korea by Montenegrin authorities.","UPDATE (March 5, 13:20 UTC): Adds details and updates headline.","Edited by Sheldon Reback.","\n"],"entity":[{"type":"Sheldon Reback","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Han Chang","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"South Korea","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"billions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Kwon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Goran Rodic","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"UTC","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Podgorica","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Joon","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Montenegro","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Terra","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Appellate Court of Montenegro","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"March 5","content":"DATE"}],"hashtag":["Terra","Do Kwon","Montenegro","US","Legal"],"authors":["Parikshit Mishra","Amitoj Singh"]}
