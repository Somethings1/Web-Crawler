As recently as October, when bitcoin was hovering around $27,000, the infamous TV financial advisor <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/255712\/jim-cramer-thinks-mr-bitcoin-is-about-to-go-down-big\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">appeared to renew<\/a> his skepticism in the digital asset. But with bitcoin up by 6% in the last 24 hours, and trading over $45,000, the one-time Goldman Sachs employee has changed his tune.","\"The late Charlie Munger, who was so brilliant, on so many things, was blind to this,\" said Cramer on CNBC. Munger served as vice chairman of the storied financial institution Berkshire Hathaway. He passed away in Nov. 2023.","\"It's a reality, and it's a technological marvel, and I think people have to start recognizing that it's here to stay. The SEC's been against it almost the whole time.\"&nbsp;","A year ago bitcoin traded below $17,000 amid the crypto winter. But its surge during the final quarter of 2023 \u2014 due in large part to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/269991\/crypto-exchange-volume-cracks-1-trillion-for-first-time-since-late-2022\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the expectation<\/a> that spot bitcoin ETFs filed by financial giants like BlackRock and Grayscale will soon be approved \u2014 has for many signaled the beginning of another bull run for crypto.
