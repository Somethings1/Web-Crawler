The analysis found that 2% of the analyzed transactions were illicit, 21% were licit, and the remaining transactions were labeled as unknown.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n","","\"This work will contribute to enabling our clients, including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions, to use our software to better identify illicit transactions and meet their anti-money laundering obligations,\" Dr. Tom Robinson, chief scientist and co-founder of Elliptic, told The Block.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nAlthough the current efforts focus on bitcoin (BTC), it could be applied to several other cryptocurrencies ranging from ether (ETH) to Facebook's upcoming cryptocurrency, Libra, Robinson added.&nbsp;<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nThe MIT and IBM researchers said they hope to inspire others to use such emerging techniques to fight \u201Csocietally important challenge\u201D of detecting money laundering activities and thereby making financial systems \"safer and more inclusive.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSharing similar thoughts, blockchain analytics firm CipherTrace recently <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/4345106\/crypto_aml_report_2018q2.pdf\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said<\/a> that \u201Csophisticated\u201D technology is needed to uncover money laundering in cryptocurrencies. \u201CTracking funds through the Blockchain system requires the most advanced computer science and cybercrime knowhow,\u201D it said.<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nEarlier this year, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/04\/24\/chainalysis-extends-its-compliance-service-to-ten-new-cryptocurrencies-citing-high-demand-and-regulatory-pressure\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">strengthened<\/a> its compliance services, helping financial institutions, exchanges, and law enforcement agencies to monitor illicit activities across more blockchains' networks.","Â© 2023 The Block.
