To start, it will contribute 1 million USDC each to the lending pools of Compound and dYdX. Unlike Coinbase Ventures, which invests in startups and takes an equity stake, the bootstrap fund will add to protocols\u2019 lending pools and return interest when counterparties borrow from it. The interest generated will then be contributed back to the pools.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">According to dYdX head of operations Zhuoxun Yin, one of the biggest challenges in building a new DeFi protocol is to attract borrowing demand. By adding USDC to the lending pools, Coinbase hopes the increased supply of USDC can drive down the interest rate and encourage more users to borrow the stablecoins.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CAs soon as we invest, the interest rate goes down in the pool itself. But then, what we have seen so far, is largely that borrowers come in and borrow. So the rates have been largely coming back to where they were before,\u201D USDC Bootstrap Fund lead Nemil Dalal told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Currently, the DeFi market is dominated by stablecoin Dai, the redemption of which<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> usually requires conversion to ether or other stablecoins first. In comparison, USDC has a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/support.usdc.circle.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360015269692-How-to-redeem-USDC-for-USD\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> fairly straightforward redemption<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> process for dollars. Therefore, an enlarged USDC pool may attract users looking to redeem their cryptocurrencies fast, according to Yin.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"I think about one of the challenges in DeFi being the facilitation of connecting fiat onramp into DeFi. The fact that you can do so 1 to 1 with USDC is actually very useful for someone coming into DeFi looking to trade and also want to be in and out of fiat quickly. It\u2019s much easier to do so using something like USDC than Dai,\u201D Yin told The Block.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For Coinbase, staking lending protocols is another step to support the growth of DeFi, an area Coinbase has always been interested in, according to Dalal. In the past, Coinbase\u2019s venture arm has invested in several DeFi protocols, including Dharma, Compound, and BlockFi.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe biggest concerns in general is that DeFi is a tiny portion of the world of banking and financial transactions. So the biggest thing for us is that we want to help grow Decentralized Finance\u2026 The only number we are tracking is the growth of DeFi and what USDC and Coinbase can do to encourage that,\u201D said Dalal.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Indeed, according to data compiled by The Block\u2019s Larry Cermak, the total value locked in DeFi protocols has grown around 176% over the past year <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/07\/18\/defi-continues-to-grow-as-new-protocols-grab-market-share\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">to $500 million<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, the majority dominated by Dai issuer MakerDao. <\/span>Meanwhile, following Dai's dominance in DeFi, <span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">USDC comes in as a distant second, with around <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/loanscan.io\/loans?interval=ytd\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">12%<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> of Dai\u2019s total loans originated volumes across several major lending protocols.&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><em data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For a deeper breakdown on the potential impact of Coinbase's bootstrap fund on DeFi, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/daily\/39160\/why-does-coinbase-contribute-to-the-already-oversupplied-usdc-lending-pools\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">read more here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>","","","For now, the size of the fund is unclear, although Dalal said it's actively looking for more projects to invest in.&nbsp;"],"hashtag":["COINBASE","DAI","USDC"]}
