Its assets, including Odysee, are being placed into receivership. As of this post, all LBRY executives, employees, and board members have resigned. All will be doing what is required to satisfy any outstanding legal requirements, but no more,\" the startup said last week.<\/span>","<span class=\"s4\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In the July 2022 ruling, the judge declined to comment on whether LBRY's token LBC was a security, which Peirce said means that the LBRY blockchain could live on, but on a more difficult path.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"The Commission\u2019s action forced a group of entrepreneurs to abandon what they built.
