A separate statement from Celsius' custody partner BitGo also notes that the company has transacted more than $1.5 billion over the past year.&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">How deposits generate interest <\/strong>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As auspicious as the growth is, there might be issues surrounding the company\u2019s interest generation mechanism and its risk disclosure to users. The company <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/support.celsius.network\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360001978817-How-do-you-earn-the-interest-to-pay-your-customers-Is-this-a-ponzi-scheme-\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">states on its website<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> that Celsius lends the deposits to hedge funds, institutional traders, and exchanges to generate interest. This means that some of the deposits would go to institutions who can put down 50% to 150% collateral based on their balance sheets, according to Mashinsky.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">However, what has not been made clear to Celsius' users is that \u201Clending to exchanges\u201D also implies that Celsius lends directly to customers on some exchanges through their peer to peer margin trading program, as confirmed by Mashinsky to The Block. In this case, the exchanges determine how much collateral they take from margin traders, and the loans these exchanges issue to traders are provided by individual exchange users or institutional lenders like Celsius. <\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">In this way, margin traders\u2019 default risks are solely covered by exchanges. However, it also means that if anything happens to the exchanges themselves, lenders, including Celsius, may face default risks as well.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CWhen you are lending on this peer to peer margin lending exchanges, you are relying on these exchanges\u2019 risk management, and if something ever goes wrong you are relying on the exchange to decide how it will be handled,\u201D a market observer told The Block.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","<strong data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Ties with Bitfinex<\/strong>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Among the exchanges Celsius works with that offers margin trading is Bitfinex, which is said to maintain good credit with its $378 million in profit last year and the newly raised $1 billion in token sales, according to Mashinsky. However, as its legal dispute with the New York Attorney General (NYAG) <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/tiny\/tether-issues-response-to-nys-court-ruling\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">deepened<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, there may still be other risks involved in lending to Bitfinex.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe risk you are taking [with Bitfinex] is an operational and regulatory risk. I don't think it's a scam or fraud, they just don't have reliable banking. There is also obviously regulatory risk with the NYDFS investigation. It\u2019s not uncommon, but there are certainly better options available,\u201D said the market observer.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To be sure, Bitfinex\u2019s margin trading business has not yet seen any known losses so far. However, there are precedents where large-scale liquidation resulted in large-scale losses for lenders. In one such incident, cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/2019\/06\/06\/poloniex-could-leave-itself-open-to-legal-threats-by-socializing-1800-btc-loss\/\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">experienced $13 million in losses<\/a> due to the price crash of CLAM tokens and it \u201Csocialized\u201D these losses among its margin lenders by taking 16.2% from the principal of all currently active BTC loans.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Celsius appeals to lenders by promising up to ~10.53% interest on their loans. According to Mashinsky, the company works with over 150 institutions to lend and borrow loans, although he declined to disclose the respective identity of these institutions due to competitive reasons. However, Mashinsky confirmed that Celsius currently does not lend any BTC on Bitfinex as the annual interest rate is only 0.3%, a rate not as attractive as lending to hedge funds and other institutional traders.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span>","Â© 2023 The Block.
