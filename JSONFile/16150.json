In his remarks on Sunday, Paller revealed the mascot for next year\u2019s gathering would be the \"SporkWhale,\" which he said embodies community ownership.","ETHDenver, a community-run conference managed by token-holder members in a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), reached new heights this year; on the first day of the main event, a staffer said there were over 16,000 tickets to be checked in \u2013 a sellout. The event had 600 staffers, Paller said.","The conference is poised to grow in size and scope next year, Paller said.
