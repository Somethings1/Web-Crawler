He will move to an adviser role at VK, he told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview.","VK said in a statement that Rogozov \u201Ccontributed significantly to the company over the years he\u2019s been working here,\u201D but that starting in the second quarter, he will focus on other projects, while advising VK CEO Vladimir Kirienko on key management priorities, strategic planning and social networks development.","Rogozov is also bringing \u201Cseveral people\u201D with him, he said, although he declined to name them or say if they are coming from VK or other companies.","Toncoin, a blockchain project using code that was created several years ago by Telegram is on its way to becoming fully integrated into the messaging app, Rogozov said.","\u201CWe are now in talks with the Telegram team as well as the teams of developers working on various projects\u201D based on the Toncoin blockchain, he said.","Telegram is on board with the plan, Rogozov said. Toncoin is already available to the messaging system\u2019s users through two in-app bots: one that facilitates donations of Toncoin\u2019s namesake tokens to content creators and a wallet bot providing in-app purchases of the token through the crypto trading firm Neocrypto.","Telegram didn't immediately comment.","A number of other projects using the Toncoin blockchain are in the works and might soon become available to Telegram users, Rogozov said. \u201CMy role is to help with proper communication between the teams and to make things happen,\u201D he said.","In Rogozov\u2019s view, Telegram is not just a messaging app: It\u2019s a major content platform because its many channels function as media outlets. That means the current boom in content creation will benefit it and boost the development of crypto tools aimed at rewarding those creators \u2013 including Toncoin\u2019s donation bot, Rogozov said.","Integration with Telegram will give Toncoin an advantage no other blockchain has, Rogozov said.","\u201CI see potential for this for the next 10 years and want it to last long. I\u2019m interested to be in the center of this movement,\u201D he said.","Last year, Rogozov co-founded Tonkeeper, a non-custodial wallet for Toncoin launched in the fall, he said.","In December, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov publicly endorsed Toncoin as a project continuing the work his team had to abandon in 2020. Telegram planned to launch TON, an ambitious blockchain with a native crypto token, in 2019, but shelved the plan after a legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the status of the project\u2019s token.","A community of developers who had been developing tools for the TON blockchain ecosystem and who participated in Telegram\u2019s hackathons subsequently picked up the code, a move that led to the development of two separate projects based on the same technology and ideas: Free TON (later rebranded as Everscale) and Newton (later rebranded as Toncoin).","Rogozov is, in a sense, a crypto veteran. He bought his first bitcoin in 2014. Since 2007, he has been working at VK.com, Durov\u2019s first company and a popular Russian social network, which Durov later exited not without a drama. Durov started working on Telegram messenger when he was still in VK.com. Rogozov was part of that, too, he said.","After Durov quit to build Telegram, Rogozov took over the CEO role at VK.com and later became a vice president for social platforms in Mail.ru, the company that acquired it. Mail.ru re-branded in October as VK, taking the name of its subsidiary."],"entity":[{"type":"2014","content":"DATE"},{"type":"TON Foundation","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Newton","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Durov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Newton (","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Telegram CEO Pavel Durov","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"CoinDesk","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rogozov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"December","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2007","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2019","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Neocrypto","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"VK","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Telegram","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Rogozov","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Russia","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Andrew Rogozov","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Vladimir Kirienko","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"2020","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"second quarter","content":"DATE"},{"type":"October","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Durov","content":"ORGANIZATION"}],"hashtag":["Telegram","TON","TON Coin","Russia"],"authors":["Anna Baydakova"]}
