They will also be able to borrow cash or stablecoins against their SGA \"at rates as low as 3.45% and use their assets as collateral.\"<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\n<br data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\nSGA was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/12\/10\/saga-launches-sga-token-to-rival-facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency.html\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">launched<\/a> last December and is pegged to the basket of currencies that form the IMF\u2019s special drawing rights (SDR).","\u201CA usual stablecoin is pegged to one asset, be it a national currency, a crypto asset or another asset type. SGA on the other hand, is reliant on the value of a trusted basket of currencies - replicating the composition of the IMF\u2019s SDR, which has been successfully used for over five decades now by the world\u2019s central banks as a stabilization instrument,\u201D Ido Sadeh Man, founder and chairman of the board at Saga, told The Block.","\u201CThe SDR comprises of the USD, the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan, which makes it significantly less vulnerable to price fluctuations caused by one currency,\u201D he added.","Notably, it is the first time the SGA token is getting listed on a lending platform. The decision to choose Celsius over other lenders such as BlockFi appears obvious: Celsius is an investor in SAGA.","\u201CWe feel Celsius and Saga share a mutual vision. [...] Additionally, we are proud to have Celsius among some of our early backers, such as Lightspeed, Vertex, and Mangrove,\u201D said Sadeh Man.

Frenkel, former Governor of the Bank of Israel and former chairman of JP Morgan Chase International, is an advisor to Saga. Frenkel told The Block that holding a basket of currencies provides for a \"desirable built-in stabilization of the value of the portfolios of currencies during market turbulence.\"","It is worth noting that Celsius is offering up to 9.9% annual interest on all stablecoins listed on its platform, CEO Alex Mashinsky told The Block. \u201CWe're able to generate this industry-leading rate of return because 100% of our borrowers are creditworthy institutions that pay a premium for liquidity, and because we share up to 80% of this revenue with our users,\" said Mashinsky."],"hashtag":[]}
