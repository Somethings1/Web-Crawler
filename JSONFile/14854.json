Nevertheless, he said the fund has seen strong trading in the past few days and it\u2019s performing \u201Cexactly like we expected it to.\u201D","Out of the ten bitcoin ETFs, WisdomTree's BTCW has attracted the lowest amount of assets under management (AUM), roughly $12.8 million (296 bitcoin), according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. Asset management giant Franklin Templeton has the second lowest AUM with $64.5 million. Leading the way in asset gathering are BlackRock (more than $3B AUM) and Fidelity ($2.7B AUM). Grayscale, who converted its Grayscale Bitcoin Fund (GBTC) into an ETF and therefore came into the race with $30 billion in AUM, has bled about $10 billion of that since ETF trading began on Jan. 11.","Peck, however, is optimistic and encouraged that WisdomTree will be more competitive going forward, saying that it\u2019s still early in the race and that in roughly six months, more advisory platforms will allow trading of the ETFs, giving WisdomTree a competitive advantage over the other issuers.","\u201CI think the platforms are getting increasingly comfortable with bitcoin as an asset class \u2026 It's just a matter of time before these are more widely available on platforms where they'll be allowed.\u201D","\u201CWe're having very good conversations in the pipeline with financial advisers and financial adviser platforms,\u201D Peck added.","Edited by Stephen Alpher."],"entity":[{"type":"Stephen Alpher","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"BlackRock","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"WisdomTree","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Peck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Fidelity","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$2.7","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$10 billion","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$64.5 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"second half of the year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Jan. 11","content":"DATE"},{"type":"AUM","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Bloomberg Intelligence","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"$3B","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"$12.8 million","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Will Peck","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Franklin Templeton","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"$30 billion","content":"MONEY"}],"hashtag":["Bitcoin ETF","WisdomTree"],"authors":["Helene Braun"]}
