DePINs leverage token incentives, composable with the broader DeFi ecosystem, to help bootstrap hardware networks, offering distributed networks of computers offering services like computing power and storage.","Existing peak-based projects include Silencio, an app for measuring noise pollution with smartphones, ELOOP, a fleet of tokenized car-sharing Teslas, and Wingbits, a network of community-run antennas listening to plane location data.","\u201CThe novelty of DePINs is in linking web3 with real-world infrastructure that is productive and generates value that can provide sustainable income for the community,\u201D Borderless Capital Partner Álvaro Gracia said.","\u201CAs we are nearing mainnet launch and public offering, this is the period that will largely define peaq\u2019s future success,\u201D peaq co-founder Till Wendler said. \u201COur plan is to further open peaq up to the community, giving it access to the tokens, and walk the extra distance to support the projects building on peaq.\u201D&nbsp;","A public offering and token listing for peaq are expected in the coming weeks, with its mainnet launch scheduled for May. An incentivized program aimed at supporting the development and adoption of DePINs on peaq is also planned, including gamified challenges with rewards for participants.","Disclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.
