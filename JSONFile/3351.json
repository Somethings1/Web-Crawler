The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/233270\/sec-sues-coinbase-binance\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">sued the company in June<\/a> for allegedly operating as an unregistered broker and exchange in violation of federal securities laws.","\u201CThis license enshrines our commitment to the market and marks the end of our licensing journey,\u201D said Hassan Ahmed, the country director of Coinbase Singapore, in an interview.","\u201COur experience in Singapore in some ways contrasts what\u2019s going on in the U.S. By providing this level of regulatory clarity and by providing clear rules that the industry has to play by, that\u2019s really important for us as we\u2019re thinking about our international strategy.\u201D","He added that Coinbase has collaborated closely with MAS and provided \u201Ca lot of policy input.\u201D","The licence paves the way for Coinbase\u2019s Singapore entity to offer a wider range of Digital Payment Token services to both retail and institutional customers in the region, while also cementing its ties with local institutions. Standard Chartered is its local banking partner. &nbsp;","The company said it has tailored its products to meet local demands by rolling out simple account funding options \u2014 including PayNow and FAST bank transfers \u2014 as well as fee-free purchases of USDC, the stablecoin.","As a business hub, Singapore is viewed as relatively crypto-friendly, but its stance towards the industry has been tested over the past year by crises at multiple crypto outfits with Singapore links, including Three Arrows Capital, Vauld and Hodlnaut. Three Arrows co-founder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/253618\/three-arrows-capital-co-founder-su-zhu-apprehended-in-singapore-bloomberg\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Su Zhu was apprehended<\/a> in Singapore last week after refusing to cooperate with the failed hedge fund\u2019s liquidators.","Yet MAS still appears willing to wave through license applicants. Coinbase joins a dozen or so other crypto operators in the region with full licenses. Wallet firms <a href=\"https:\/\/crypto.com\/company-news\/crypto-com-obtains-major-payment-institution-licence-from-monetary-authority-of-singapore\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Crypto.com<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/blockchain-com-payment-license-singapore-mas\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Blockchain.com<\/a> both scored MPI licenses over the summer.","\u201CI think Singapore\u2019s a few laps ahead some of these other crypto hubs,\u201D said Ahmed.&nbsp;\u201CThey\u2019ve seen both good actors and bad actors go through and now they\u2019re uplifting those regulations.\u201D","Â© 2023 The Block.
