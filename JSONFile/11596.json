But the platform has previously faced user interface issues that have resulted in a loss of user assets.","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To deal with these issues, OpenSea entered a program with HackerOne, a crowdfunded ethical hacking platform designed to help companies discover and fix basic vulnerabilities before they can be misused.<\/span>","As part of the program, OpenSea offers bounty rewards in tiers according to how serious the threat is. For instance, a \"low\" level SeaPort (OpenSea's smart contract) bug can earn a whitehat up to $1,000, while a \"critical\" one can lead to a prize of up to $3,000,000. The bug bounty program from OpenSea is still live on HackerOne.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved. This article is provided for informational purposes only.
