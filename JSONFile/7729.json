Grayscale, which has long offered a wide-range of trust products, is another.&nbsp;","Unlike an ETF, which trades on a national securities exchange, Grayscale's products trade over-the-counter and don't always track the price of the underlying asset. Still, it has been able to charge a hefty fee to traders.&nbsp;","Grayscale, the largest crypto native asset manager, is suing the SEC to upgrade its trust to an ETF.","Data from The Block Research indicates that the firm brought in more than $230 million from its flagship GBTC and ETHE products since the beginning of the year. Still, the 2.0% and 2.5% annual fees it charges to manage those assets may soon collapse if BlackRock can successfully bring a rival product to market, says James Seyffart of Bloomberg Intelligence.&nbsp;","Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust manages over $16 billion.&nbsp;","<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/data\/crypto-markets\/structured-products\/grayscale-revenue-from-gbtc-and-ethe-estimated\/embed\" title=\"Grayscale Revenue from GBTC and ETHE (Estimated)\" width=\"100%\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><\/iframe>","Seyffart, who joined an episode of The Scoop this week, noted that a BlackRock fund would hit Grayscale's valuation.","\u201CIf BlackRock wins approval for their ETF, which isn\u2019t guaranteed, it may decrease Grayscale's valuation because Grayscale would be forced to lower fees sooner than might have been assumed,\" Seyffart noted.","\"On top of that, if GBTC converts to an ETF then the fund will be subject to potential outflows,\u201D he added.","DCG \u2014 the parent company of Grayscale \u2014 has actively been looking to offload assets, including media company CoinDesk, in the wake of the crypto credit crash. The firm's lending unit Genesis Capital owes more than $3 billion to its creditors and was at risk of default earlier this year.","Â© 2023 The Block. All Rights Reserved.
