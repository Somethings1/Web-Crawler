According to the National Association of Realtors, as people looked to move amid pandemic lockdowns, the median home sale price for a US home was $346,900 in 2021, up 16.9% from 2020. This was the highest on record going back to 1999. Home sales had the strongest year since 2006, with 6.12 million homes sold, up 8.5% from the year before.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CInvestors can participate by purchasing into the future appreciation of the property and build a portfolio of real estate assets like they do with stocks,\u201D says Carpentier.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">People interested in investing can browse a searchable marketplace, make offers for desired assets, and \u201Cleverage liquidity\u201D on the secondary market, or in the event of the traditional sale of the property.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vesta argues that this construction democratizes wealth creation by providing unhindered access to the value locked into the real estate market.&nbsp;<\/span>","Similar arguments have been made before by crowdfunding players in real estate, however the use of NFTs has been brought into play here due to the speed of execution on Vesta's blockchain of choice, Algorand.&nbsp;","Carpentier says the choice came down to the fact that Algorand is immune to forks, gives instant finality on sales, which usually clear within four seconds, as well as having low fees.&nbsp;","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The platform is looking into future models where an NFT could be used to buy an owner out of their mortgage or constructions for first-time buyers looking for options other than debt financing.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe model will evolve and adapt to scale-up to other use case applications,\u201D Carpentier said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Vesta expects to have spread across the US within 12 months, after an initial launch in California. Properties in a number of other states will also be available on the platform on launch.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThere will be an education process with homeowners where we will have to explain to them the proposition,\u201D said Carpentier.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">One such property owner, who has listed his Las Vegas home on the platform, is Mike Pitcher. As someone who had dabbled in real estate investments in the past, Pitcher had been looking for a blockchain solution.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">He argues that from a buyer\u2019s point of view, this structure is beneficial because you can buy smaller portions of the asset, which is not possible under normal circumstances in real estate.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">So far, NFTs have been focused largely on tokenizing digital assets, however a recent wave of projects have set their sights on real-world applications.&nbsp;<\/span>","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/134006\/propys-sale-of-nft-tied-florida-home-nets-over-650k\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Earlier in February,<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Propy, a real estate blockchain company, sold its first property in the United States.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The sale drew attention for the fact that, as part of the deal, the owner receives a non-fungible token as digital proof-of-ownership.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">As noted by the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tampabay.com\/news\/real-estate\/2022\/02\/11\/nft-house-sells-for-654k-in-historic-auction-tampa-condo-up-next\/?itm_source=parsely-api\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Tampa Bay Times<\/span><\/a><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">, the condo was previously owned by Leslie Alessandra, founder of a crypto company called DeFi Limited. Among other properties, the sale of a condo in Florida under similar conditions is forthcoming.<\/span>","Carpentier says that he doesn't want to exclude potential investors or people interested in the market by only pushing the blockchain angle of the product. It has to be accessible and usable first, he said.&nbsp;","\"You don't care about the technology in your phone -- whether it's 5G or 4G, you don't care how the camera works,\" he said. \"You just want to know that it works, and that's exactly the approach we've taken.\"","Â© 2023 The Block.
