Currently, the network has over 5,490 BTC ($128 million) in capacity, up from 3,350 BTC on Jan. 1, 2022. This is being seen as a positive sign for the adoption of Bitcoin transactions.","The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, designed to enable fast and cheap micropayments by allowing participants to transact directly without the need for immediate settlement on the blockchain. It operates as a network of bi-directional payment channels between participants, allowing for off-chain transactions that are eventually settled on the Bitcoin blockchain.","It was designed to mitigate the issues seen on the Bitcoin mainnet, such as slow transaction speeds and high fees. The network achieves this by enabling users to open payment channels between themselves, which allows it to handle high amounts of low-value transfers without having to broadcast every transaction to the Bitcoin main network.","The network's ability to mitigate the issues seen on the Bitcoin mainnet has made it an attractive option for both businesses and individuals. For example, the integration of Bitcoin payments in El Salvador was made possible by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/192445\/bitcoin-lightning-strike-payments-3-african-countries\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Strike<\/a>, a payment service based on the Lightning Network.

The cryptocurrency has increased by 38% since January 1, 2023, rising from $16,500 to $22,800 at the time of writing, per CoinGecko <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/bitcoin\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">data<\/a>.
