She said the testnet is scheduled to launch in the second half of this year.","Scroll was founded early last year by Peng, Ye Zhang and Haichen Shen. It aims to scale Ethereum using zk-rollups, a Layer 2 technology that bundles Ethereum transactions off the main chain to support a larger number of transactions at a lower cost.","<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/135161\/ethereum-scaling-solution-starknet-completes-launch-with-goal-to-move-to-community-control\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">StarkWare<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/123617\/ethereum-layer-2-scaling-solution-developer-matter-labs-raises-50-million\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Matter Labs<\/a> can be seen as Scroll's closest competitors \u2014 both use the zk-rollup scaling technique.","When asked what Scroll's unique advantage over StarkWare is, Peng said, \"we are building a zkEVM solution as opposed to StarkWare's zkVM.\"","\"That means developers in the Scroll ecosystem will enjoy an 'EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine] equivalent' experience; any dapp that runs on zk Layer 1 can be deployed on Scroll,\" she said.","As for Matter Labs\u2019 zkSync network, it also has EVM compatibility like Scroll, but Scroll is more developer-friendly, according to Peng.","She said, with Scroll, Solidity developers can copy a smart contract byte code from Ethereum and deploy it on Scroll without making any changes to it. \u201CWe are EVM equivalent or native EVM by the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s definition,\u201D she said.","Specific details of Scroll\u2019s technology will be announced in the next few months, said Peng.","The Series A round brings Scroll's total funding to date to around $33 million. The project has previously raised about $3 million from angel investors, Peng said.","Scroll's fundraising is the latest for an Ethereum scaling project amid continuing investor interest in the crypto sector.
