Linea is a zero-knowledge rollup network that launched its mainnet in July.","PancakeSwap will bring its swap and liquidity provisioning features to Linea. Swap in decentralized finance or DeFi refers to exchanging one token for another, while liquidity provisioning involves adding funds to a pool to facilitate trading and earn rewards.","After the swap and liquidity provisioning features, PancakeSwap is expected to bring its farm feature to Linea in the coming months. The farm feature allows users to stake their liquidity provider tokens and earn PancakeSwap's native CAKE token while keeping a position in their LP tokens. PancakeSwap is also expected to deploy its initial farm offering or IFO platform to Linea in the coming months, which gives early access to new tokens.","PancakeSwap first <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.pancakeswap.finance\/articles\/pancake-swap-joins-linea-voyage-s-de-fi-week-as-a-testnet-ecosystem-partner\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">collaborated<\/a> with the Linea team in June as a testnet ecosystem partner.","Linea is the seventh blockchain PancakeSwap has expanded to as it focuses on Ethereum scaling networks.
