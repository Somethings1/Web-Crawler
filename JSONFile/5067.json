It then reached out to the Fulcrum team to disclose the vulnerability.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"It took nearly 4 hours for the Fulcrum team to manage the issue, and we got no details from the team about the progress. Additionally, the deployment of the fix took another 12 HOURS, because of special system upgrade timelock in the smart contract.

This was an act of good faith,\" said Kistner.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\"We told them we were writing a post-mortem and scheduling it for the end of Feb.
