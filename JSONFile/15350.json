Prosecutors said the pair made threats to \u201Cdestroy\u201D the company if they were not paid millions of dollars.","Hlady pleaded guilty to extortion in April 2021, and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. He has not yet been sentenced.","Nerayoff, however, has maintained his innocence from the beginning. In their motion to dismiss filed in February, Nerayoff\u2019s lawyers said their client was the victim of an elaborate setup by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which they say knowingly pursued false charges against Nerayoff in order to get him to turn over incriminating evidence on his contacts in the crypto industry.","The allegations made in Nerayoff\u2019s motion to dismiss are explosive.","His lawyers say their client was put in a van on the day of his arrest and given a clipboard with a list of names of hundreds of the top players in the crypto industry, from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin to Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, and instructed to give the FBI dirt that would help them make \u201Cdozens of convictions\u201D in exchange for a lighter sentence. (To be clear, neither Buterin nor Long have actually faced any public allegations from the government. They're just a couple names plucked from the list Nerayoff's team mentioned.) They also claim that Hlady, Nerayoff\u2019s employee, was an FBI informant who exchanged 100 texts and 45 phone calls with the investigating FBI agent ahead of the pair\u2019s arrest.","On their face, Nerayoff\u2019s claims sound like something out of a techno-thriller novel. Even his lawyers concede in their motion that the allegations sound like \u201Ctin-foil hat material.\u201D But the claims do resonate in early 2023 as the U.S. government aggressively goes after the crypto industry.","The credibility of Nerayoff\u2019s story isn\u2019t helped by his own reputation for stretching the truth: In the past, he has styled himself as a co-founder of Ethereum, which has been labeled an exaggeration by other early Ethereum contributors.","The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has denied many of Nerayoff\u2019s claims. In their own motion to dismiss, they repeatedly denied Nerayoff\u2019s speculation that Hlady was a government informant, though they acknowledged that he did, in fact, communicate repeatedly with the investigating FBI agent. The DOJ\u2019s motion to dismiss does not address Nerayoff\u2019s claim that he was put in a van and given a list of names.","In dismissing the case, Judge Brodie denied Nerayoff\u2019s motion to compel the government to turn over more evidence and records, including the minutes of the grand jury proceedings and Hlady\u2019s communications with the investigating agent, making it unlikely that the public will ever see the evidence that could back up Nerayoff\u2019s claims that he was set up.","But, even without evidence to back up Nerayoff\u2019s claims, the fact that the government dropped their case against him after his explosive allegations certainly invites speculation. And his claim that he was set up in order to take down bigger fish in the crypto industry could ring true for some this year, as the intensity of the U.S. government\u2019s clampdown on crypto leads to unproven suspicions and conspiracy theories that Washington is out to kill the industry.","Anthony Sabino, a professor of law at St. John\u2019s University, told CoinDesk that it\u2019s uncommon for prosecutors to drop a case after obtaining an indictment.","\u201CSecuring an indictment in the first place is difficult enough,\u201D Sabino said. \u201CSo, the government is fairly confident it can win. To drop a case post-indictment means some change in circumstances that dissuades the prosecution from continuing.\u201D","And while there is no proof that Nerayoff was put in a van and told to start talking, Sabino said it\u2019s \u201Cnot fiction\u201D that such things happen. It is \u201Ca typical government tactic, but usually not so melodramatic,\u201D he said.","However, in the absence of evidence, Sabino said people should not necessarily assume that it\u2019s true \u2013 but it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility.","\u201CHe could have been brought in for routine questioning, and maybe they made him quite comfortable. What matters is that the government is always looking for cooperation, i.e. making a deal to obtain testimony and get someone higher up in the organization,\u201D Sabino said. \u201CThe best real-life example by far [is] Sammy \u2018The Bull\u2019 Gravano turning on John Gotti, which was also in the Eastern District [of New York].\u201D","Edited by Nick Baker."],"entity":[{"type":"Sabino","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"U.S.","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"2017","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Custodia Bank","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"a-half year","content":"DATE"},{"type":"April 2021","content":"DATE"},{"type":"U.S. District Court","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Vitalik Buterin","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nerayoff","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nerayoff","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Nick Baker","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"New York","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"March 20","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Ethereum","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Margo Brodie","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Nerayoff","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Anthony Sabino","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Michael Hlady","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"millions of dollars","content":"MONEY"},{"type":"Brodie","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"John Gotti","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"Hlady","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Seattle","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"Gravano","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"St. John\u2019s University","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"May 5","content":"DATE"},{"type":"2023","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Washington","content":"LOCATION"},{"type":"February","content":"DATE"},{"type":"Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Caitlin Long","content":"PERSON"},{"type":"FBI","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eastern District [of New York]","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Eastern District of New York","content":"ORGANIZATION"},{"type":"Steven Nerayoff","content":"PERSON"}],"hashtag":["Regulations","Ether","Buterin","FBI","DOJ","Ethereum"],"authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"]}
