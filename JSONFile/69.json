In addition, it permits AVSs to sign up for the beta version of EigenDA.","EigenLayer allows users to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/learn\/271529\/how-does-staking-work-and-where-does-the-yield-come-from\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">stake ether<\/a> and earn a liquid staking token (LST), which can then be restaked for more rewards. The native restaking is done through EigenPod, a user-managed smart contract that helps monitor balance and withdraw statuses.&nbsp;","\"Until now, restaking in EigenLayer meant simply depositing LSTs, or setting validator withdrawal credentials to an EigenPod,\" EigenLayer said in a release. \"Now that operators and an AVS (EigenDA) are live, being an active restaker means delegating to one of the top 200 operators running AVSs. Over the next few weeks we expect high operator turnover in the top 200 active set, as new operators, delegations, and AVSs come online.\"","The mainnet launch does not entail AVS in-protocol payments to operators or slashing, however. \"We are allowing the EigenLayer marketplace to develop and stabilize before introducing in-protocol payments and slashing to mainnet later this year,\" the protocol added in the statement.&nbsp;","\"Slashing\" refers to the punitive measure where validators can lose a portion of their staked ETH as a penalty for bad behavior or failure to comply with protocol rules.","EigenLayer maintains around $13.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to the crypto data tracker DeFiLlama.
