In total, it will custody 18 assets, including<\/span><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">&nbsp;bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin, and 13 ethereum-based tokens, including Basic Attention Token. It is a striking number of coins considering Gemini's conservative listing approach \u2014 the exchange has only added support for <a href=\"https:\/\/gemini24.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115005868106-Which-digital-assets-does-Gemini-support-\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">six assets<\/a> since launching in 2015.<\/span>","The launch of the new business comes at a time of increased competition in the custody landscape.

At the same time, new players such as Anchorage and Fidelity Digital Assets have come online to offer investors a new way to store assets in what is known to be a volatile market.

To get a better understanding of its market positioning, The Block spoke with Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, Gemini\u2019s Managing Director of Operations who joined a year ago from Nasdaq\u2019s International Securities Exchange.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The following is an edited transcript of our discussion:<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block: <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">How are you differentiating Gemini Custody instant trades from your competition?<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hightower-Sellitto: <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">I believe that our offering for Gemini instant trading is unique in the crypto space for custody. We\u2019re providing liquidity from cold storage for the exchange account for trading on the Limit Order Book that Gemini operates. There's a big difference between trading OTC and trading on a regulated listed order book.&nbsp;<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block: <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Can you explain how Gemini Custody\u2019s instant trades work?<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hightower-Sellitto: <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">For custody instant trades, we allow customers to trade on the exchange using the balances they have for those particular assets in cold storage without sacrificing any of the security in the withdrawal process. This provides customers immediate liquidity to their holdings that are held offline without having to miss any market opportunities for which they would want to be trading as assets on a real-time basis. So if there\u2019s a price dislocation coming to market, you don\u2019t have to wait the hours or longer for those assets to be actually physically delivered into the exchange account. We can credit your exchange account for the assets that you hold in cold storage and you\u2019re able to initiate trading on those balances right away while we follow the full security feature set for withdrawing your assets from cold storage. We can give you the advance because we have a super liquid hot wallet for the exchange.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block:<\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"> Is this a full rollout or are you in test mode?<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hightower-Sellitto: <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">It\u2019s a full rollout.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block: <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">What\u2019s new in the feature set?<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hightower-Sellitto: <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The user interface has been live for a short period of time but the ability to initiate the transfer to the trading account for Gemini Custody instant trade is new. The ability to create unlimited sub-accounts for both custody accounts and exchange trading accounts is relatively new, we put out that release last Tuesday. The ability for customers to self-manage view-only access for account activity is new. Gemini Clearing for OTC trades was announced last Friday. Expanded custody support for the 13 ERC-20 tokens is new.

We think customers should be evaluating their custodian based on the quality of their offering, their security profile and their operational procedures, and not necessarily because others have put assets there.

Chicago came about because there were qualified candidates we were seeking to hire in the Chicago area and it made sense for us to expand there based on that talent available in that area.

There are a lot of options market participants that have migrated to crypto so I\u2019m happy to see us with a presence there and catering to that customer base.<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The Block: <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Are there other markets that you\u2019re looking at?<\/span>","<b data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Hightower-Sellitto: <\/b><span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">We just announced that we\u2019re expanding into Australia so international expansion is at the forefront of our minds. We already operate in 49 of the 50 U.S. states as well as Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, United Kingdom. Bigger cities have large groups of individuals that may have an interest in crypto so we\u2019re focused on those.
