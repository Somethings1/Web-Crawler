Fortune said it is more likely that wallets that could support a British digital currency will be produced by the private sector.&nbsp;","That is not the case elsewhere, however. A pilot version of e-CNY, the mobile wallet for China\u2019s digital yuan, went live on iOS and Android app stores in January. In El Salvador, citizens are encouraged to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/post\/131452\/el-salvadors-chivo-wallet-keeps-breaking-and-users-are-seeking-answers\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">state-backed wallet Chivo<\/span><\/a> to manage their bitcoin, which was made legal tender in the country last year.&nbsp;","Wallets aside, most other technical questions relating to the Bank of England\u2019s CBDC work remain open.","It is not yet even clear, according to Fortune, whether any CBDC issued by the central bank would need to be underpinned by blockchain technology \u2014 a form of digital ledger that supports most major cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;","\u201CThat\u2019s still a really open question for us. It\u2019s not taken as a given that it is built on a blockchain, it\u2019s not taken that it\u2019s not,\u201D she said, adding that the Bank has been canvassing a wide range of views through its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.uk\/news\/2021\/september\/membership-of-cbdc-engagement-and-technology-forums\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">CBDC forums<\/span><\/a>, whose members include representatives from banks, fintech firms and academics.&nbsp;","If the central bank chooses to move forward with a CBDC after publishing its consultation paper later this year, it would then enter a development phase that would involve \u201Cworking up some prototypes,\u201D Fortune said. She does not see a CBDC launching in the UK until 2025 at the earliest.&nbsp;&nbsp;","One consideration for the Bank of England as it continues to explore a CBDC launch is what impact such a currency may have on commercial banks in the UK.&nbsp;","Sir John Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblockcrypto.com\/linked\/84530\/boe-central-bank-digital-currencies-deputy\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\"><span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">said in November 2020<\/span><\/a> that it is not the job of central banks to protect commercial banks from the impact of digital currencies. Fortune echoed that point.","\u201CFinancial stability is [the Bank\u2019s responsibility] \u2014 it\u2019s one of our mandates,\u201D she said. \u201CBut preserving current business models isn\u2019t.
