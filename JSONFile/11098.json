Each component will have its own independent snapshot. \u201CThe purpose of the snapshots is to determine which parts of the proposal to include in the on-chain vote(s), and whether to adjust or change any pieces.\u201D the proposer Fei Labs stated.","The first snapshot will be for the consolidation component and occur the week of August 22.","The proposal stated it could take one to two months after the snapshot before any developments are put up to an on-chain vote.","Â© 2023 The Block.
