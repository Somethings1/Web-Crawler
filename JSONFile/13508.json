Torres is a member of the House Financial Services Committee, which is tasked with overseeing the SEC.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CI hope that the SEC will find itself so chastened by the court\u2019s decision that it will concentrate the Commission\u2019s enforcement energies where it belongs: on the bonafide bad actors who perpetrate serious transgressions like fraud, market manipulation, and the misappropriation of customer funds,\u201D Torres said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Advocates for the crypto industry were elated last week after a New York judge ruled that XRP was not a security when sold on the secondary market in \u201Cblind bid\u201D sales. Judge Analisa Torres did, however, side with the SEC when she said that the token was a security when sold to institutional investors.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Torres, who also sits on the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, said the decision could have future implications.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">\u201CThe ability of the SEC to make up the law as it goes along will be, in the meantime, constrained by the persuasive authority that the Torres Doctrine will likely command in future legal cases,\u201D Torres said.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span class=\"s1\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">The SEC declined to comment.
