The MIM stablecoin fell to as low as $0.95 before rebounding to $0.98 as of 5:30 a.m. ET, according to data from CoinGecko.<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">While it's not immediately clear why the stablecoin lost its dollar parity, fears that a portion of its value is backed by FTT, the native token of the pressured FTX exchange may be the likely catalyst.

This $28 million exists as MIM stablecoin borrowed by Alameda using FTT as collateral, <a href=\"https:\/\/zapper.fi\/bundle\/0xe31a9498a22493ab922bc0eb240313a46525ee0a,0x712d0f306956a6a4b4f9319ad9b9de48c5345996,0x93c08a3168fc469f3fc165cd3a471d19a37ca19e,0xca436e14855323927d6e6264470ded36455fc8bd,0x83a127952d266a6ea306c40ac62a4a70668fe3bd,0xc5ed2333f8a2c351fca35e5ebadb2a82f5d254c3,0x89183c0a8965c0299997be9af700a801bdccc2da,0xe5d0ef77aed07c302634dc370537126a2cd26590,0x5d13f4bf21db713e17e04d711e0bf7eaf18540d6,0x882a812d75aee53efb8a144f984b258b6c4807f0,0xbefe4f86f189c1c817446b71eb6ac90e3cb68e60,0xb78e90e2ec737a2c0a24d68a0e54b410fff3bd6b,0x964d9d1a532b5a5daeacbac71d46320de313ae9c,0xfa453aec042a837e4aebbadab9d4e25b15fad69d,0x4deb3edd991cfd2fcdaa6dcfe5f1743f6e7d16a6?label=Alameda%201&amp;id=0x58c1423aa47e51ef9bf861514fea2dd38c9b3f2f\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">on-chain data<\/a> on various Alameda wallets show.&nbsp;<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">Total MIM borrowed | Source: Abracadabra<\/span>","<span data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">To ensure all stablecoins are overcollateralized, Abracadabra employs an on-chain liquidation mechanism.
