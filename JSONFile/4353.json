The initial mint price was set at $99. Buying an NFT automatically entered the purchaser into a sweepstake, with prizes including a group cocktail party at Mar-A-Lago, a dinner in Miami or a golfing trip with the former president, or a group Zoom call.&nbsp;","Buying 45 or more NFTs would \"guarantee\" purchasers an invite to a gala dinner with the Republican in South Florida, the announcement said.&nbsp;","It appears there are already some Trump NFT whales among holders. Currently, 34 wallets hold 100 or more items from the collection. OpenSea figures also suggest that 1,000 of the NFTs were airdropped to <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/0xfb65415Ca83B69DA9bC56B4C9C2334fa402baCd7\/trump-digital-trading-cards?tab=collected\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">one wallet<\/a> hours before the public sale. The second-biggest holder currently owns <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/0x4C82C44B7AdAed758Cd97f5CA04551433B3d7e15\/trump-digital-trading-cards?tab=collected\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">673 NFTs<\/a> from the collection.","The Block contacted the project for more information on the wallet containing the 1,000 NFTs and the nature of the airdrop, but had not heard back by publication time.&nbsp;","The mint may have netted Trump almost $4.5 million. Creator fees set by OpenSea also give a 10% royalty on secondary sales, meaning the project will already have accrued almost $80,000 from trades to date.&nbsp;","Some items are already reselling for more than $7,000. An NFT collector called Nanitor bought a greyscale NFT of Trump in a Christmas hat for 6 ETH (or $7,200).&nbsp;","Trump follows his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/linked\/127784\/former-first-lady-melania-trump-releases-first-nft-on-new-platform\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">wife Melania<\/a> onto the blockchain.
