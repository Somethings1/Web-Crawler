Ariss himself was involved in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-leicestershire-52981336\" data-v-f87c67ca=\"\">the seizure of more £300,000<\/a> from a drug dealer in Leicestershire in June 2020.","An increase in such seizures led to a rise in demand for secure options to store the confiscated crypto.","\u201CVirtual assets and cryptocurrency feature heavily in a significant proportion of cybercrime in the UK,\u201D Ariss told The Block.","\u201CThe fact that we require a bespoke solution suggests that we\u2019re talking about significant sums of money.\u201D","He added that, up to this point, \u201Ca range of different options\u201D have been utilized by the police to store confiscated cryptocurrency. Concern over the security of this arrangement is what led the Cybercrime Programme to seek a more uniform solution.","Komainu\u2019s successful bid for the procurement contract was supported by CoinShares, a digital assets specialist with around $3 billion in assets under management, and Gentium, a British law enforcement consultancy focused on cybercrime.","Jean-Marie Mognetti, chief executive of CoinShares and a director at Komainu, told The Block that Komainu will handle secure storage for the police while CoinShares will help convert seized funds into fiat currency in the event of a successful prosecution.","It is not exactly the role Komainu, which targets institutional investors, was set up for \u2014 but Mognetti says the firm is well-suited to the job. &nbsp;","\u201CKomainu is built by institutions for institutions. Komainu is powered by trust, technology and transparency,\u201D he said.","\u201CWhen you\u2019ve built an institutional product, national bodies and supranational bodies feel that you\u2019re ticking the box for them as well.\u201D","The collaboration may be part of what appears to be a wider attempt by UK authorities to up their game when it comes to tackling criminality involving crypto.","The National Crime Agency (NCA) recently advertised a job opening for a Financial Investigator (Criminal &amp; Civil). The job ad stated that the NCA has a number of roles open in Cyber Crime Financial Investigations, and that candidates should have \u201Cexperience of conducting financial investigations into cyber dependent and enabled crime and the criminal abuse of crypto currencies\u201D.","The NCA did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication."],"hashtag":[]}
